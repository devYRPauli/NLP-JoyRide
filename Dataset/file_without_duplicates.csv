acura,ilx,2013,mahowald, 08/12/2012,Getting 43 Mpg on daily commute,pos,"I love this car.
Gas mileage, suspension, and stereo are great.
Bluetooth integration and Pandora integration work perfectly. Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.
Although it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. 
Gas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying."
acura,ilx,2013,VIP, 07/26/2016,New to me ILX,pos,"I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.

acura,ilx,2013,bybchucky, 09/14/2013,Excellet Commuter Car,pos,"I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."
acura,ilx,2013,bayareamom, 01/26/2015,Peppy Hybrid that Turns Heads,pos,"We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!  "
acura,ilx,2013,Kerry Olson, 03/26/2016,2013 Acura ILX Hybrid w/ Tech Package,pos,"In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.

acura,ilx,2013,boudouris_3, 06/19/2012,"Surely NOT just a ""glorified Civic""",pos,"Just upgraded from my 5-spd Saab 9-3 sedan to a brand new Acura ilx w/premium package and the 2.4L 6-spd engine.
The premium package comes with nearly everything that you could ask for minus navigation.

Very nice engine note that gives the car some personality without sounding like a cheap tuner.
The only knock I could say about the ilx is the interior space which is expected to be small due to the price point and market that Acura intends to target.

If you're in your 20s or early 30s and are looking for something fun to drive without sacrificing the luxury amenities, look no further than the ilx.

Oh and by the way, I'm getting 35-40 highway mpg."
acura,ilx,2013,geiim, 01/29/2013,An Excellent Car!,pos,"I have had my ILX now for over a month and 1,500 miles. It is an excellent car. The complaints about the 2.0L engine being slow are not accurate. I find it to be very peppy and responsive. Plus I drive 64 miles back and forth from work 5 days a week and I have never gotten less than 30 MPG, with an average of 29 MPG city/hwy driving overall. The interior is of excellent quality and the ride is smooth and quiet. The electronics are excellent and the sound system is very good, I use the XM radio all the time and it never drops out. I'm 6 ft tall, 250 lbs and I fit very comfortably in the car. I've even ridden in the back seat and that was comfortable. It looks great and rides great! "
acura,ilx,2013,Brittany, 05/19/2019,Owned for 6 yeasr,pos,"Have not had trouble with maintenance in over 6 years.  I've only had the oil and tires changed. It has never broke down on me. I highly recommend it!. I'm currently at 94,000 miles and get around 32-36mpg total. Full gas tank holds around 11 gallons. I'm still happy with my purchase with no regrets. I got the 2013 model and purchased it pre-owned that same year in May 2013 with 3000 miles on it.
"
acura,ilx,2013,Banjo, 10/25/2016,Pleasantly Surprised!,pos,"My previous car was a leased 2015 Civic EX-L, but due to a job change I needed to get out of my lease mileage restrictions. I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price.

acura,ilx,2013,hleong, 07/27/2012,Driving this car to work everyday....,pos,"This is the second month I am driving this car to work, everyday for 70 miles. 

Certainly don't feel like driving a Civic. Indeed, I owned a 2 doors Accord for 9 years and ILX is way more luxury than Accord, hence I don't know why people said it is just an upscale Civic?! Drive before you judge.... 

Compare to Lexus CT200h and CT200h is not even close to ILX, in luxury and design. ILX designers/engineers are really serious in doing the job and they do it very well. "
acura,ilx,2013,central25thst, 07/23/2012,Go fast with looks,pos,Grown up with a 6 speed. Smooth shifting tranny. Soft touches allover. Smart phone integration is incredible. 
acura,ilx,2013,sethwas, 04/22/2013,best deal in town if you do your homework,pos,"How to sum this car up - there are no other vehicles in this size that have this many features at this price.
That could be good or bad. 
There are larger vehicles that have this many features at this price (with no gas mileage penalty) and there are plenty of vehicles that are this size that are less expensive and have less features.
So if you could lease a Civic EX-L or a premium package ILX (same monthly payment after you factor in gas and insurance) which would you choose?
If you could buy a loaded Accord or Mazda6 for the same price which would you choose?
Does the badge or dealer experience matter?
All are amazing vehicles - you just need to decide where you want to be."
acura,ilx,2013,hondafan30, 09/08/2012,Acura ILX Impressions after first month,pos,"The Ilx is a great car. I am a Honda/Acura fan which is a big part of why I purchased this car.
You can get more car for the money with Toyota, Honda or Nissan any day, but if you want the Acura badge and build quality you pay the premium. The car handles extremely well, road noise is pretty low and the interior is one of the most comfortable and aesthetically appealing of any car I have owned. The interior isn't large but its done very well. I really enjoy driving this car and it gets its fair share of looks. Don't judge this car by pictures, I went to the dealer to buy a tsx and left with this because when I saw it the body styling really hooked me in. It is definitely not a rebadged civic"
acura,ilx,2013,jeepcolorado, 09/16/2012,Happy with my Acura ILX after 4000 miles,pos,"I purchased the Acura ILX after owning a Jeep Grand Cherokee for seven years.
I really wanted a new JGC Overland, but decided it made more economic sense to look for a comfortable 60 miles/day commuter that would still give the feeling I was driving a solid entry level luxury car with most of todays tech features.

The ILX has a very well engineered interior that seems well above the luxury level of a Civic or other lower end cars and in line with most other cars up to about 40K.
It is a very pleasant place to relax while commuting a couple of hours a day.

With a low 30's budget I compared against the Audi A3, VW GTI, Lexus 250H, and Suburu Outback and decided this was the best choice."
acura,ilx,2013,stevenrose, 11/11/2012,So excited to buy my new Acura ILX,pos,"I have owned many cars from Jeeps to Volvos and I keep coming back to Honda products.
I owned a 1996 Acura Integra and I always refer to that as my favorite car.
I owned a 2007 Volvo S40 that was pretty to look at, but drove very choppy.
The 2013 Acura ILX is really smooth and fun to drive.
I have read reviews that the ILX car is a Honda Civic in a tuxedo.
What is wrong with a Honda Civic?
My 2006 Honda Civic EX Coupe drove 10 times better than my Volvo S40 and the new ILX I just purchased drives even smoother and is 10x more luxurious than my Honda was.

I think I have found that perfect blend of performance, luxury and style.
I think I might have found my new favorite car."
acura,ilx,2013,ilx2013je, 01/21/2013,Polished metal metallic/Parchment Premium Pkg.,pos,"3 months of ownership and I'm extremely satisfied with my new ILX.
Very peppy for a small 4cyl. engine. Ride and handling are very impressive.
Excellent use of space on the interior.
I'm coming from a mid-size and don't miss the little extra room I previously had.
I don't want to see many of them on the road, but everyone should give this car a try."
acura,ilx,2013,ajwhitesox, 05/31/2012,Very satisfied,pos,"Just purchased this car brand new... black on black tech package.
 Love all the tech features!
Nav, weather, bluetooth audio, backup camera....

Average gas mileage combined is 30 thus far.
VERY quiet on the road.
 I really like the way the car looks and the keyless entry on the door handle makes life easy.
 LOVE IT!

acura,ilx,2013,ILX driver, 08/23/2017,Feels like a Civic with luxury price tag.,neg,"I helped m Grandma buy a CPO 2013 ILX w/ Tech. package.  She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 ""luxury"" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic.

acura,ilx,2013,ohmygoshitsme, 06/22/2012,IN LOVE WITH THIS CAR!! ITS A HEAD TURNER!,pos,"My dad and I spent months trying to find the perfect car to me.
When I finally sat in this one at the dealership, things just clicked and I knew that this was the one. I love the sleek, exterior design, and the interior has really nice, soft leather. Now I'll never get lost thanks to my navigation, and lovely backup camera!!! I just wish this car had blind spot monitors and had memory seating feature, so I wouldn't have to adjust it everytime someone sits in my car! Also, I don't like how the front and wheel interior is black and the rest of my car is beige! But otherwise, amazing performance and a real money saver when it comes
to gas. Couldn't be happier with it! Love my birthday present"
acura,ilx,2013,Austin C, 12/16/2018,"Fun Drive, Slow Ride",pos,"If you live in a city where traffic and drivers all appear to have an emergency, be prepared to drive like your part of a funeral procession. This car has one gear that has umph...3rd. Every other gear is designed to keep you from the gas pump and they do. The ILX handles incredible well, takes corners with ease and brakes suddenly when needed. Keep your stereo loud, as you want to drown out the road noise. The interior is sharply designed , but does so with less than stellar Lego material. Looks great, just don't touch anything...kills the illusion. I have never experienced any mechanical failure...not one. I still have great braking left after 67,000 miles. I keep taking my car in, thinking the mechanics who inspect my car, forget to check the brakes. The cars design is fantastic. When another car passes me, as they usually do, they stare at the car or is it me, for moving too slow? Overall, I would buy this again without hesitation. No car has made me laugh so hard with the look of speed and the resiliency to keep me pleased. I do really like this car...just please put the rest of the gears in next time.

acura,ilx,2013,Saleen8928, 09/06/2019,Best car you’ll find in this class!,pos,"This car is comfortable, and feels roomier than its small size would lead you to believe.  The navigation system is easy to use and the screen is clear and large.  The upgraded sound system is better than I would expect in this class of car.  There are a few minor drawbacks to the car, but based on the price point, you have to expect some trade offs.  First, the 150hp engine is sufficient for 80% of situations, but it’s definitely underpowered.  Get the optional 200hp engine if you can (I think in newer models they made it standard).  I have driven a 2018 with the 200hp, and it makes a huge difference.  Second, there are no memory seat buttons.  I didn’t think this would be a big deal when I was car shopping, but I realized quickly that I used memory seats way more often than I thought.  Then again, I’m someone who is overly sensitive to a seat position that’s slightly off from what I’m used to!   It would be nice if they made this model in AWD, but snow traction is about as decent as you can find without all wheel drive.
"
acura,ilx,2013,Alison, 11/13/2020,Awesome little car!,pos,"I love my ILX Hybrid.  Extremely reliable, Great ride and Great gas mileage (more than advertised even when driving in sport mode).  No mechanical failure and I’m up to 97k miles.  Love the Dolby surround sound!  Just overall a great car and joy to own!
"
acura,ilx,2014,stevenrose, 10/29/2013,Great performance and great value,pos,"Hi-I still love my Acura ILX, the highlight of the car is the responsive engine and transmission.  I also think the care is very attractive and I love the way the steering wheel leather feels.  I also think the steering is also very responsive, even thought it is light.  The only downfall to the car is road noise , however I changed the tires and it made a huge difference.  I did research on Tire rack and purchased tires with the highest rating and I am very impressed.  I am not sure why Acura puts the Michelin Pilot mmx4 on the car when they are not rated well for noise.



I have to say my new ILX is a great car.
The engine is really responsive and the shifting is really smooth.
The interior is finished very well and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels great on the hands.

Handling is excellent, the car goes exactly where you point it.
After the car is broken in, the car is really sporty to drive.
I think the car is underrated.
Consumer Reports does a great job recommending the ILX, other reviewers complain that the ILX is underpowered, but I would give it a test drive.
I drove the new Accord and the Subaru Legacy and I liked the ILX a lot better.
I like how compact and zippy it feels.

I am an Acura Fan and in love with the ILX

acura,ilx,2014,aeroj101, 06/23/2014,I absolutely love this car!!! Best car purchase I have made.,pos,"I bought the manual 2.4 version about a month ago, and I am completely in love with this car. First, I think I am probably the target consumer (young professional at a corporate job). I wouldn't want a Civic Si, but I definitely wanted a manual transmission (and the MT option is the ONE main reason I chose the ILX over a Lexus IS; I don't care if the IS is faster, I wanted an MT). The sound isolation is good, road comfort is great (I'm not trying to experience all the bumps on the road), and I personally love hearing the tune of engine revving up (it's beautiful, and it's a manual, and that's part of the fun). I am committed to only owning MT cars, and am glad Acura makes a few."
acura,ilx,2014,david_d82, 07/16/2014,Great Alternative to Boring Commuter Cars!,pos,"I bought my 2014 ILX 2.4 a little over a month ago, and it's been a great purchase.
I did a LOT of research before purchasing this car, and I am very happy that I was not scared off by some of the reviews from the automotive journalism industry.


First, this car is not a rebadged Civic Si. different dimensions, different suspension setup and hardware. Also no garish wing or ugly red interior inserts like the Si. Yay!
Great manual transmission, too. clutch pickup is spot-on, and shifts are super smooth. nice enough features for the price, but infotainment screen is kinda chintzy, and rear seat passengers really need HVAC vents! Reminds me a lot of my 2006 TSX with a manual only better"
acura,ilx,2014,ryhi, 12/08/2016,Second hand ILX 2.4L 6MT,pos,"I was looking for a good commuter with a manual transmission I could hold on to of the next 15 years. I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda
 F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.

acura,ilx,2014,scorpio69er, 03/18/2014,Ignore the automotive writers and just drive one yourself,pos,"I own the 2014 ILX base 2.0L 5-sp auto. First off, the 150 hp engine is just fine, thanks. I can cruise at 80 mph on the interstate all day long. I've had no issues running at very high altitude climbing fairly steep grades, and getting up to speed is quick at about 8 sec 0-60 -- once the engine is broken in. It's also economical. I'm averaging 30 mpg with ~8K miles of mixed driving. The differences between the 2014 and 2013 are not minor. The 2014 now comes standard with heated leather seats (driver's is powered), rear-backup camera, 17"" alloys, and additional sound deadening, including active noise reduction. I'm 6'1"" and I fit in the car just fine. Go test drive one yourself."
acura,ilx,2014,zoomjag, 03/28/2015,What you expect from the driver's seat isn't what this $31k Civic delivers.,pos,"Disappointing with time.  This vehicle doesn't feel like a comprehensive 'package' - It's an economy car, that's it.  Acura has taken a Civic (which is perfectly good as is) added a great dash, and some engine and suspension tuning and called it a day, and these mechanical touches don't really seem to add anything to the Civic package nor compete with the Civic Si(as if engineers just threw ""good parts"" at the car without testing). In many ways, the result here is an underpowered, loud, econobox with disturbing views from the drivers seat (funhouse drivers mirror, subpar plastic on the lower doors, blindspots for days) with a stereo that doesn't deliver premium sound leave you expecting more"
acura,ilx,2014,pwdrday, 09/11/2014,Fun little car,pos,"When I started looking at this car, I found it to be mediocre on paper.    Acceleration, handling, mpg, etc all seemed acceptable, but it didn't stand out.  However, I ended up taking a test drive because manual transmission cars have become hard to find, and they were giving big discounts.  After a test drive though, I realized that this car was something special, and the more I drive it the more I like it.  I'm happy to say that this car has a much higher fun factor than I originally expected.  The clutch and transmission are just a pure joy to use.  It's definitely the nicest manual transmission I've ever had, including multiple VWs, a Saab, and multiple Subarus.  The engine also loves to rev and has a wonderful sound for a 4 cyl.  It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.  However, if you are OK with the normal noise levels found in Hondas/Acuras, this is a great choice for a little sporty car!

acura,ilx,2014,wdc6446, 05/11/2015,Love it,pos,"The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  Like many others, I was a little worried I would miss having a turbo but loved the combination of economy, luxury,reliability and good looks that this car offered, at a price I could feel good about. Feels sporty, smooth, and responsive. I can honestly say I haven't missed the horsepower. I can't believe it doesn't get better reviews.  I have the Tech package, and love the bluetooth, the navigation, and the sound.  I rarely get less than 30 mpg and that with considerable city driving.  When you give it gas, it has a healthy rev, and cruises very comfortably at 70-80mph.  Passing is never a problem. "
acura,ilx,2014,1speedbike, 03/15/2014,There's more to life than horsepower!,pos,"Was apprehensive at first considering the HP ratings, BUT for the price this car can't be beat! Lots of high-tech and comfort features for <$30K. Heated power comfy seats, rear camera, voice integration, bluetooth, active noise cancellation, NAV, leather, sleek styling. This is NOT just an ""upgraded Civic.""

Obviously, engine leaves you wanting, but its buttery smooth and loves to rev, and is plenty for highway passing. Suspension is not too taut like a sports car, but not overly soft. Steering is typical Honda light, but also responsive. Great handling for FWD. Also, super LIGHT car with consistent 30 mpg.

Other than power, it has everything I could ask for in an entry luxury sedan. "
acura,ilx,2014,bybchucky, 03/02/2014,Excellent Commuter Car,pos,"I recently purchased an ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."
acura,ilx,2014,pda2, 02/26/2014,Excellent Value!,pos,"Well, I have the smaller engine in the automatic and it aint a beast..but with the shifter paddles
you can manipulate the gears slightly for a little bit more oooumph. From a quality to price standpoint, this is VERY hard to beat. I looked at Chevy's, Toyota's, even the Mazda 3 and 6, all similar price points. The quality inside and lines out, make this look like and feel like a much more respectable and high quality ride. What car would you rather show up in at a clients house? What car would you rather trust with a child inside? LCD screen is VERY small BUT the trunk holds 2 sets+ of golf clubs. It rides very smooth, seats adjust easily, the interface is user friendly with simple buttons "
acura,ilx,2014,Tommy, 01/28/2016,Reliable and luxurious,pos,"My family has had a few acuras. We have always loved them. From an Mdx with 200k+ miles to brand new RL's. Great ride, sleek look, great gas, inexpensive to maintain compared to other cars in this class.

acura,ilx,2015,stevenrose, 10/06/2014,My ILX is a great car,pos,"Update: My ILX has only continued to perform better with each mile.  The engine and transmission are as smooth as silk and it feels spritley.  It also looks great.  Great car!!!  I really enjoy owning my ILX.  The ILX offers a great value.  For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17"" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.  On the highway you don't even realize you have hit 80 because it is pretty smooth.  Road noise is the only downfall, but when you are listening to the great stereo you don't hear a thing.   If you read some reviews I think they are unfair, the car is excellent.  I test drove the Audi A3 1.8T and the turbo and love the ILX by far.

acura,ilx,2015,NicBran, 10/04/2015,Great entry level luxury car,pos,"Before purchasing this car, I had a Mazda RX-8 which I had owned for 9 years.  I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest ""want"" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of ""gliding"" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to ""gliding"" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying ""It is a beautiful car, it sells itself"".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8.

It handles great on curvy roads, the seats feel like they were made for me. The price was even reasonable for the performance and comfort. This is the best manual I have ever driven, it's smooth, it's fast and it's so much fun! I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty, yet functional car."

acura,ilx,2016,Shane Gochenouer, 09/02/2015,I LOVE this car!,pos,"This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and ""Build and Price"" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call ""practical luxury"". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. 

The only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11"" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).

UPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Holly Swanson, 04/30/2016,I love it,pos,"I absolutely adore this car. I have no idea what some people are talking about regarding the seats being uncomfortable. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever driven in. This car is just what I was looking for...a beautiful, reliable and luxurious commuter. The white model really turns heads and by the first week I'd already gotten so many compliments. Interior road noise is perfect, road feel is excellent, steering is excellent, ever little detail in his car screams luxury. Really nothing bad I can say about this car, and no I've not been paid to say these things...this car is just that good.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Eric, 04/30/2016,Hard to Categorize,pos,"This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.  You have to read between the lines.

acura,ilx,2016,ILX2016, 01/02/2016,Best Value - Entry level luxury sedan,pos,"If you're in the market for an entry level luxury sedan, you're most likely considering the Audi A3, MB CLA or the BMW 320, along with the ILX. Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart; but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.

Considering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category.
"
acura,ilx,2016,barry, 08/28/2015,Solid Commuting Car,pos,"I use this car almost exclusively for commuting, about 20 miles each way. It's a good solid car with great value. Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.

Pros:
Great value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.

Cons:
Transmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it.

I never had any problems with my 2013 and really like the updates on the new one. Performance is up due to the new engine but the old one was efficient and peppy. Good ride quality and very good value in the entry level luxury class. Compare to A3, CLA feature for feature and you'll see what I mean."
acura,ilx,2016,carfever, 02/06/2016,Bells and Whistle Galore!,pos,"I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!
PRO:
($30,000 out the door)
This is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  
CON:
If you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like ""oh my! you got a new Mercedes or Audi!). But you know what? I got good price and great value for my car so F the neighbor...haha!
"
acura,ilx,2016,Gagan, 07/14/2016,Excellent for its price & quality,pos,"Have own the fully loaded Tech plus A-SPEC ILX with the bigger 18"" wheels, GPS and all.
First what it lacks: 1. A HUD, which I feel is a must for all luxury cars
2. Lack of lumbar support
3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.
4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.
5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!

The Good parts:
1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!
2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.
3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.
4. Cost & maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!
The german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.
5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.

The problems I've faced with mine:
1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.
2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.
3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash & tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!
I would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!

acura,ilx,2016,jrasero, 06/21/2016,Maybe not a German killer but one heck of a value,pos,"Just traded my 2016 RDX Base for the 2016 ILX Premium.  Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it's loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn't as luxurious and doesn't perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can't ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can't have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.  The Premium with Blind Spot, cross traffic alert, real Milano leather, and the two tier screen system are worth every penny.

acura,ilx,2016,Dorenes car, 08/11/2016,More for the money!!,pos,"We were searching for a good lease rate and reliable vehicle that was stylish and had good ratings.  This car has a sports car feel, fun to drive, and handles beautifully (except for a small turning radius)!  The stripped down version gets you a sunroof, backup camera, and very nice front seat, all safety features, great Bluetooth,  all for less than many non-luxury compacts, including the Civic, which has higher lease costs and less features for the price.  Well worth our investment!!

acura,ilx,2016,Eddie Estares, 09/28/2016,Just the right car.,pos,"My 2nd Acura to date and just like the previous one, it's been great. Excellent highway mileage of 39 mi/gallon and is not a slouch if you want speed. The car handle really well around corners and have a very good braking system. We currently have 6 Honda made products; 2 Civic (2005 and 2007), 2 CRV (2009 and 2013), the Ilx, and a lawn mower and all have been super reliable. I place reliability above anything else and my experience with Honda cars have been excellent. Both Civicc and the 2009 CRV have way over 100k miles and not one ever had a single problem. I don't expect less from a Honda built automobile and I don't expect less from the Acura either."
acura,ilx,2016,KS, 02/26/2018,An Expensive Civic No More!,pos,"I am quite familiar with the 2013 ILX and it was a great disappointment.  The refreshed 2016 ILX is what we expected in 2013, but instead got an expensive Honda Civic.  The 2016 feels much more premium and is quieter on the road.  The suspension feels tighter and more solid.  The exterior refresh is quite nice; it gives it a sportier look, but still looks like a luxury vehicle.  The greatest attribute of this car is the 8 speed duel clutch transmission, that is paired with the 2.4L engine.  The K24 is already a seasoned and beloved motor and this new 8 speed DCT is incredible.  The shifts are smooth, quick, and the rev-match down shifting is addicting.  This truly is the best compromise between an automatic and manual transmission.  This is my sister's car, which already has 47,000 miles on it and no problems have occurred.  That is no surprise, as my dad has an 09 TSX with 95k(never using the required premium gas) and never a repair once.  My father is now eyeing to replace his TSX with the ILX A-Spec and I too, will now be in the market for one, as well.

acura,ilx,2016,Ronnie, 12/07/2015,Not as thrill asi thought to be,pos,"I came from a manual stick shift 2003 Acura RSX Type S. I love that car and the only reason why I stick with Acura. I need a small compact 4 doors vehicle since I'm a family man with two kids. I looked at the Civics, the Accords. But they just blah and not exciting in terms of styling. Plus. I didn't want to be like 80% of the car out there on the road, so many of them. From teeny boppers, grandma's, Grandpa, to your soccer moms. No thanks. 

So there it is, I got the 2016 Acura ILX with premium/Aspec package. Honestly, its not really an upgrade from my RSX. Everything about this car feel cheap and could be better. Feels like they are rushing it. The gears always shifting. It can never stay in one gear long, it always shift to make sure the gears are highest fuel economy at the current speed. It's good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration. Coming from a cable, maybe it have to do with the new electric drive by wire, who knows but its really annoying when you need that quick acceleration. Now on the other hand, the Dual Clutch mode is awesome, stellar and works perfectly. I think that pretty much the only part of the car that stands out. Very responsive, smooth gear transition from downshift and up shift. The steering is numb and you don't feel that much road feed back. The handling is good. Not much body roll. The car puts me to sleep. I need some excitement, the thrill of a screaming VTEC kicking in. Instead I got a very boring tone. The seat doesnt have much bolster to snug you in. I feel Acura lost touch with its racing heritage. My other pet peeve is the head room, I'm 5'11"" but it really cramp in there. Only about in of space left from the ceiling to my head.  I will probably pass this car to my wife in a few more years and get myself a stick shift car. 

If you like driving like grandma, just chill, relax, cruising and looking good in it. Then this car is for you.

acura,ilx,2016,PJ, 02/15/2016,Deserves one more star but please read it.,pos,"I got my car back in April of 2015. Reason I took off one star is squeaky front brakes issue.  It's factory defect and acura is aware of it (Please google on tgat issue if you are interested). Acura did not want to change my brakes at time I came in and I don't have any more time to waste with them so I live with it.  It's a huge disappointed  especially for a brand such as acura. 

Another star I taken off because I believe few other things could have been better.  Such as,  very rough ride over uneven pavement and especially potholes. No 40/60 rear fold,  whole rear seat just folds.  Steering is a little numb as well. Not too much headroom for tall drivers. 

Never the less its an enormous value. For $27k you get compact (a plus for some)  0-60 in less than 7 seconds,  great fuel economy,  decent handling,  sunroof,  keyless entery,  duel clutch transmission,  full Led head lights,  Adaptive cruise,  crush prevention system, auto dual climate, heated seats and mirrors,  back up cam,   Acura badge (Might matter to some.

acura,ilx,2016,Melissa, 04/17/2016,Bought 2 in one year,pos,"Ok....so after driving my Mini Cooper hardtop and commuting 70 miles a day 6 days a week I decided it was time to trade in the stick shift and grow up. After looking at all the entry level luxury vehicles, I decided on the Acura ILX. My situation is, I wanted economical luxury. I wanted a car I could drive until the wheels fell off. I wanted a car that I didn't have to make difficult appointments for to get serviced or maintained. I didn't want to worry about what service needed to be done when the service due light came on....a burden I had driving the mini. For me, this car works great! I bought the premium package in black right around when they launched the 2016's... Drove it for a year and realized I had made a huge mistake. Black is a horrible color to keep clean when you commute and don't park in a garage! So when I took my car in today for its second ever service, I was somehow made an offer I couldn't refuse on a brand new white premium with ASPEC. There is a major difference between the two. I love the ASPEC seats and odometer and foot pedals. The front looks less like a beak! I'm so glad I upgraded! Maintence is painless and affordable! No stress car for younger commuter! I'm happy!

***update 1 year later.  This car is a great commuter and is so easy for me to get serviced. No hassle ! I'm so glad I got a white car because I think I only washed it 4 times in a year! I'm driving the heck out of it and it's great!  Only complaint is the scraping if you exit a driveway or take a dip too fast.. you must be very very slow since the front end sits kind of low. Other than that, no complaints so far!

acura,ilx,2016,Ken Mason, 02/07/2016,"Great Car, Fun to drive",pos,"No one is paying me to write this review.  Just thought you'd like to know.  I sincerely don't understand Edmund's grade of ""C"" for the ILX.  I drove the Lexus IS 200t.  Yes, it was very smooth and very powerful.  But it costs almost $10,000 more than the ILX.  And has anyone noticed that the front grill of the Lexus looks like the mask for Darth Vader?  I'm sorry, but once that picture became fixated in my mind, I just couldn't stand looking at it any longer.  I also drove the BMW 228i.  A little more money than the ILX but with half the standard features and honestly, I didn't feel much difference between the BMW and the ILX.  I love the look of the ILX with the Prem and Aspec package.  The spoiler and upgraded wheels make the vehicle.  The upgraded interior is also really nice and the seats have a nice sporty feel to them.  The acceleration for this 200 hp engine is tremendous.  Okay, so I also drive my 013 Toyota Tacoma so getting into the ILX is like getting into my own sports car.  I like the sound of the engine and I like the feel of the road.  We also own a 014 Acura RDX and it drives like a charm.  My only tiny complaint is I wish Acura would make a coupe the size of the new TLX or the ILX.

Updated review....Still fun to drive, just not as fun as I first thought
The 8 speed transmission lags when extra speed is needed. Also, the transmission kinda jerks when it is down-shifting and then I need to punch it to accelerate. Also there is a rattle that just drives me crazy. It is a fun car to drive. I'm not sure I will buy another ILX. Who knows.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Don Sutton, 08/09/2016,Can I have my TSX Back Please?,pos,"This is my 3rd Honda and my 2nd Acura. After 300K+ miles and 11 years, I gave my old 2004 TSX to my son who is still driving it. 
I decided to lease a new 2016 ILX after Acura did the redesign of the exterior and put back the peppy and quick VR4 that was in my TSX. 
On the plus side, the car is just like the TSX: great handling, terrific on corners and curves, super reliable, solid feel, awesome braking, beautiful long drive on the road touring vehicle, takes 5 passengers around town comfortably with room for luggage, and gets lots of compliments on the styling and interior design. Gas mileage is okay - but not the 29 mpg average promised. Only getting 27 consistently when 1-2 passengers, much less with a full car. 
On the minus side, I wish the car was like the TSX: the dual screen technology seems redundant and is very distracting compared to the single touch screen the TSX had, the acceleration is hesitant - the car seems to 'think' about moving faster before it actually goes into gears. Gas mileage sucks in city driving. Freeway is 31mpg only, not the 35mpg promised. UPDATE after 1 Year: Exterior pain gets stained easily. Design flaw. Looks like the clear coat is easily damaged by on road flying liquids. 
OVERALL: Great car, just wish Honda/Acura had not removed the 'fun' and 'simple' aspect of the TSX. Sadly, sometimes I want to take back my old TSX from my son and give him the ILX....

acura,ilx,2016,I'm sold on Acura, 12/09/2017,Better than my A4,neg,"Was talked into buying a 2016 ILX certified pre-owned with 2,000 miles and it was the best life decision I have made.  Premium  (leather pwr pass /drvr seats, etc.) Acura Watch Plus fully loaded (not A Spec) with 100,000 bumper to bumper, free roadside assistance, those expensive rubber trunk/floor mats,and 7 complimentary oil changes /tire rotations for $27,000 and 0% financing.  It handles like my old 1997 A4 Quattro 6 speed and not like the over priced, poorly designed, bastard-driving Audi's-BMWs-Mercs of this generation.  I used the paddle shifters to easily drive through icy conditions and felt incredibly safe.  It corners as well as my old A4, looks great, and with the Acura Watch Plus, I feel safer than I did in my large SUV.  Use your turn signal and the car tells you everything around you.  Forget about the turn signal light on the side mirrors, you don't need it.   Rear camera, lane departure, adaptive cruise, brake warning, BLIS, all standard with the Acura Watch Plus.  The best part is the driver can not only manually enable and disable, but also modify the settings for almost each feature.  Couldn't do that with the Volvo, Audi, BMW or Merc I test drove.  Got a job in LA and drove this car I-40 from NC to CA and at one point on cruise control, I looked down and the meter registered 500 miles before empty.  Normal city driving is usually closer to 350 miles per tank. Cruising at 90+ felt like 55...so watch the speedometer.  The nav system takes about 20 seconds to register once you start the car, but it got me through 2500 miles and not one wrong turn.  It even automatically reset the time zones for me.  I knew exactly where I was all the time.  The complaints about its awkwardness is probably from some professional reviewer who was paid by Volvo. The bluetooth is clean and clear and Siri sync works 99.5% of the time if only Apple would update software more often.  If I had to complain, the pass through is right at the wheel house, so it narrows and you lose about 12 inches of space where the seat drops.  But I was still able to load the trunk with two 40"" LED TVs with oops I forget to pack this in the moving van room to spare.  People are really impressed with its comfort and style.  I drove 2500 miles in 3 days and the seat was incredibly comfortable.   Best part is I laugh when I pull up to get gas and all the PREMIUM UNLEADED people watch their $$$ pour right into their tank.  My 1997 Audi was great, but when it needed repairs $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  and $$.   I've owned American muscle cars and European sport sedans and a crappy Nissan Maxima swearing I would NEVER buy a Japanese car again.  This Acura is the best car I've EVER owned and I know I will easily and safely get over 100,000 or miles out of it.  Shhhh... don't let the secret get out.

My last acura, i had storage in the middle compartment, doors, and behind seats. It doesn't have an overhead storage for glasses either. Besides those minor challenges, the car handles great, i haven't really openned it up, i just reached 1500 miles on it. I am happy with the car, acura makes very good products, look forward to enjoy car for a long time

acura,ilx,2016,Bec703, 09/05/2016,Electronic safety systems reduce driving effort,pos,"**NOTE**  ILX not TLX -- I liked everything about this car except for a few items -. Hate the speech recognition system: doesn't recognize my commands, very inflexible command structure,. Cabin noise is to high with the premium tires, the navigation system is not compressive with current systems., even, no speed limit indication, messy to input destinations and 2nd waypoints. The good thing is Siri works well and does understand voice commands. Likes: snappy, 8 speed transmission is outstanding, Best reason to own are the electronic safety controls.  These take about 50% of the effort out of long distance driving.  Also getting 39 mpg on highway trips. Low roof for tall people

acura,ilx,2016,Raul, 01/11/2019,Just an Ok Car,pos,"I purchased the car in 2016. I purchased it for the technology and safety features. It’s been OK. The navigation is very slow.

acura,ilx,2016,ejko, 02/17/2019,Almost Right,pos,"This car is almost a great car.  The transmission is a bit jerky, particularly when driven at a leisurely pace.  You sit very low in this car.  As Time went on, getting in and out of this car became increasingly irritating.  My wife and I are in our 60s; this may not be of consequence to young people.  I never had a problem with the car; for me it was very reliable.

acura,ilx,2016,Donald Bassett, 07/29/2015,Issues with infotainment,pos,"This is my first Acura and generally I am very happy.  I haven't had it in for the first service yet but wanted to know if anyone is having issues with the infotainment system.  About once a week when I start the car the radio stations will come up with all the programmed numbers wrong.  The stations are correct if you select them but the numbers displayed are wrong.  Sometimes it will correct itself after a while and sometimes it won't.  Twice the backup camera has not gone off when I shift out of reverse and the upper display stays on the back up camera the entire time I am driving.  Next time I start it will go back to normal.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Tim S, 03/09/2016,Swing and a miss,neg,"I bought this car because after test driving it reminded me of my '07 Civic Si, which I sold to go back to school, only a bit more refined. However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. 

I'll start with the positives: The engine is good; it's a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it's working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it's an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.

Now to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver's seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don't like to crank lumbar up to 11, you're not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you’re going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there’s the fact that in the best position I’ve found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.

The rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here’s the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling; leather wrap on the steering wheel; stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)’ phone call quality; ease of using phone controls…pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it’s made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. 

So you might think that if you don’t care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren’t for the issue with the driver’s seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si.

acura,ilx,2016,Jim, 07/23/2016,55 months- 98000 miles,pos,"Like other Hondas I have owned in the past, this 2016 ILX has been flawless. It doesn't drive like a BMW or Audi, but it handles very well and the ride is good, except on rough pavement. I love all of the tech gadgets and the sound system is good. I live in the city, but most of my work commute is on the highway.  I am a stickler for gas mileage and this car does not disappoint. It routinely gets over 40 mpg on the highway, averages 36 in mixed driving, and has never clocked less than 31 mpg (winter) on a tank of gas. I run it with regular gas and have seen no difference in performance compared to premium.

acura,ilx,2016,Cheryl Steeper, 03/22/2017,So Very Disappointed!,pos,"Wanted to stay with Honda products, having been an owner of Honda or Acura since 1980.  Like the exterior styling of this car very much.  However, I have a spine condition and find the buckets are too deep and make my back hurt after 30 minutes.  Hate the hesitation with acceleration & feel like I'm driving a tank, but need to make allowances here since I am coming for a car that has 260 hp.  Wish I had gone for the Navi on upper level package because there is a stupid black screen behind the clock that is distracting.  The cabin feels claustrophobic and small.  The seating adjustments are not enough.  I'm trying to find a seat cushion to fix the bucket issue, but everything pushes my head into the headliner.  I've had this car for 3.5 weeks and am counting the days until I can sell it & get something else.  I've sat in every Honda and Acura product and only found 3 seats that were comfortable for my back...Honda Fit & HR-V, and Acura TLX.  Latter is too big and hated the push buttons (had those on my teenage car and not going back!), car also too big.  Fit is OK, but feels like I'm downgrading from old Acura.  HR-V was OK, but don't want an SUV.  Finishes on interiors of Honda & Acura products really cheaped out now.  Still looking for something to replace this Acura ILX.  SOOOOO very disappointed in Honda/Acura now.  Feeling really let down by this manufacturer.

acura,ilx,2016,Monica, 06/25/2017,Expensive Name with Basic Entertainment,neg,"Very disappointed in the hands-free system when in actuality it's Hands-On. You can only dial numbers that are stored in your speed dial other than that you are having to use your phone to dial numbers. While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn't have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn't make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be. I feel as though for this car to be as expensive as it is that this Siri radio should have come along with it. But no it's a basic radio station with speakers that are not loud at all and there's no touchscreen to do anything. This is by far the worst car I've bought and wish I would have kept my Hyundai Elantra which features on the inside were so much better than this Acura and I paid 10 - 15 G less. I've contacted Acura numerous of times with only to be told that this will go in a file for my complaints. I sure wish  they would give me another car with the features that are  basic in other cars or buy this one back. This is a $30,000 car and I am so disappointed in it . I advised them that I would sell them this car back in a heartbeat and now I'm stuck with an expensive car with basic features and a High car payment. So definitely think twice about buying the ILX because you will really be disappointed in the features that they offer you in such an expensive body.
Review: nothing has changed for the better. No room in car and I've almost received ticket due to having my phone in hand for trying to make a phone call because the Calling system in the car is poorly done.  I've call the company and they still have not tried to rectify my problem or even offer me a better car from my money. Their attitude is oh well. They may would have helped me If I was of political or entertainment status.

acura,ilx,2016,Jeff, 03/29/2016,"The good , the bad, and the ugly",neg,"I was looking forward to driving this car because I liked the styling and have owned two Acura TL's. After owning 10 Honda's also , I thought I'd check it out
The car has a nice cockpit but no lumbar support or adjustment so it was out for me with back issues. It is laid out nicely but storage is the least I've seen in any other car. console compartment is small and cheap feeling and the door storage can fit a tennis ball??
My main compmaint is a general one with the CVT transmission on ANY car. It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse 
Over al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars. I just want to actually enjoy the driving experience. Acura is only better than Honda of you can spend over $30K. The Civic is a superior car to the ILX and less expensive. Back to Honda or maybe Subaru

acura,ilx,2016,Steven Rosengren, 07/25/2015,I love my new 2016 Acura ILX,pos,"I ended up trading in my 2016 Acura ILX after owning it for only 3 months.  There was a brake defect where the brakes kept squeaking and after the rotors were replaced once and pads twice, the issue came back.  I think a recall will come at some point, but I was not going to wait because I was very disappointed.  The other Acura's I have owned have been great, I was very surprised that this car was released with this issue.  I traded it for a Mazda CX-3 and it is more fun to drive and and feels more powerful then the Acura.   The other issue with the Acura I noticed was the engine hum, it actually bothered my ears when I had the windows open.  The 2014 Acura ILX I had I liked better overall after owning this one for 3 months.  Before purchasing ask the dealership to give you one of their loaner cars that has a few miles on it and make sure you like driving it in everyday driving.  I would recommend buying a used 2013-2015 ILX instead.  Or a Mazda 3, I think the Mazda 3 GT would be more fun to drive everyday than the Acura.

acura,ilx,2017,Victoria Smyth, 09/09/2017,Great car at a fantastic price,pos,"I bought this car to replace a 2001 Integra.  This car is different (let's face it.  There are few cars available today which are going to handle like the Integra.). Most modern vehicles have electric steering (ugh) and McPherson struts or something similar.  The double wishbone is gone for the most part.  HOWEVER, although this car is different, it is still a lot of fun to drive.  It handles extremely well with a lot of horsepower for its size.  The steering is good for electric and there is good feedback.  This is he first automatic I have owned in many decades of driving.  My advice: put it in sport mode, step on the gas and look for some winding roads.  You won't regret it!

March 2018.  It is 7 months on and there has not been a single problem with this vehicle.  It handles pretty well in the snow.  It handles well on wet pavement. It is nimble and very quick on dry pavement. I drive in comfort mode to commute and it responds very well when I need to merge into traffic.  CR rated the ride poor, but I don't find it so.  I think it is perfect for a ""sport sedan"".  I've hit a few very bad potholes with no serious side effects. Two minor complaints: the armrests are too low and there is no dome light.  Otherwise, it is excellent.

Three years on, the car is great.  Only oil changes and inspections so far.  Gets 32 mpg in mixed highway and city driving.  Love it.

acura,ilx,2017,SDA, 12/15/2016,Regressing but still worthy,pos,"Feels like Honda literally sent Acura a civic LX and they ""pimped your ride"" with some leather and such. Back in 2007 with my first new Acura, the TSX was with navi or not, and came fully loaded with all the other features and was tons of fun to drive, especially in the twisties (mine was a 6 speed manual). Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you're nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. ""Pleather"" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you'll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days. If you want a touch screen entertainment system you'll pony up $2,000 for the premium package and also get some nick-nack features like perforated leather and blind spot detection. If not you're stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17"" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it's trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it's higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000. Truthfully it really is just a very comfortable, better looking Civic that you can lease for under $300 a month with $0 down, however, it may be the best thing you can get for that price in the luxury market.

acura,ilx,2017,Tricia, 07/20/2017,Snazzy Little Car,pos,"When we decided to buy a new car we looked at the Honda Accord, Subaru Legacy and the ILX.  The Subaru had a lot of safety features but wasn't very attractive. Honda surprisingly didn't ride that smoothly and if I wanted all the bells and whistle was very pricey. We have a 2006 TL and it has been a great car so we decided to look at Acura and the last car we saw was the ILX and it was IT!  The ride was smooth and had much more power than I thought it would, it has all the bells and whistles I wanted and the safety features that Subaru has.  We were able to get the Tech Plus for a price lower than both the Honda and Subaru with the features we got.  I've had the car a couple of weeks and the gas mileage is great and I'm truly enjoying it.  I've had several people comment on how good looking the car is.  I see other reviews slamming this car but this  60 year old Nana with a snazzy red little car couldn't be happier.

acura,ilx,2017,Redwings15, 12/12/2016,Fantastic Entry Level Luxury Vehicle,pos,"Overall extremely pleased with my new ILX. The vehicle is attractive to the eye with quality panel fit and finish and a stunning paint job. The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle.

Than I fell in love with my ILX, It was the best car I have driven out of all the four cars I listed. I drive 45 minutes from my house to Manhattan and it was saving me money and was a quiet and comfortable ride. I had a 2012 Passat SEL but I had so many problems and waste so much money that If I add all the maintenance prices plus the passat I could have boughten I Lexus or BMW, So I got the ILX.

The vehicle is a luxury Honda. Honda is the co-parent of Acura and therefore it is to be a ""pimped"" out Honda. That is the sole purpose for starting Acura.

acura,ilx,2017,Laurel Blue, 10/16/2016,A new Dud,neg,"I just leased a new 2017 Acura ILX two months ago. This was the seventh Acura I've owned or leased, beginning with the 5 cylinder Vigor many years ago. I loved each and every one of these cars...except this one. I HATE it. There should be a warning sign on these- ""Watch out! Buy this if you're a dummy."" The ""new"" 8 gear transmission, with two clutches, is way too complex and does not offer performance as Acura bills it. The car hunts for gears as you accelerate, and has very little power from 10mph to 40 mph when you are accelerating. The car lugs in the lower gears. My previous car, a 2014 Acura ILX was perfection itself. I should have kept it. The most annoying aspect of this new car? The muffler. Acura is apparently ignoring its traditional (loyal) adult audience and seeking to attract new users that are young men in their 20's. So they have ""boosted"" the HP, but this is not accurate. The car is much less powerful than before, despite the claims for higher HP. And it is supposed to be thriftier on gas, but so far (I now have a little under 2000 miles) it is not as much of a gas-saver as was my 2014 Acura ILX.  The worst thing? The muffler. It is noisy as all get-out. I suppose this was to attract those young males. I would do anything to get a different muffler that is quiet. I do not wish to hear the constant ""throaty growl"" Acura has decided is necessary.  I keep thinking 33 tortured months to go...Arrgh.

acura,ilx,2018,Fred, 09/20/2018,Very good car for the money,pos,"I always admired this car when I saw it driving or parked. So I went to the dealer to test drive it. I was impressed with acceleration, steering feel, handling and overall ride. The interior is not luxurious but it has a sporty upscale aura to it.  The exterior lines and design also look quite sporty . I ended up leasing it for much less than the competition (Audi A3, BMW 3 series, Mercedes Benz CLA, Lexus IS, Infiniti Q50 among others) .Overall it's a fun car to drive and I feel like it offers a great value in the crowded and very competitive  entry level compact sedan category.  The base offers everything I wanted- A  peppy 2.4 /201 HP engine (more than some of the more expensive competitors), moon roof, heated leatherette seats , power drivers seats, heated mirrors , rain sensing wipers, steering wheel controls for Bluetooth, audio , cruise and more......  If you want more options like navigation, safety features and various other upgrades the payment rises accordingly , but still less than every other competitor. I also test drove mainstream compact sedans such as the Honda Civic , Nissan Sentra and Mazda 3 all drove terrific as well but the prices were too close to the more powerful Acura ILX.
"
acura,ilx,2018,Graham, 05/03/2019,Love/Hate,pos,"Last June 2019 I sold my ILX lease to Carvana and pretty much broke even financially. The reason for that is I got my hands on a 2014 Acura TSX Tech package with 29k miles, black/black. The car had one owner, clean CarFax, certified, and Acura dealer maintained.

I would say finding a 5-year-old car with all that is a rare find. I love having another TSX and the reliability, handling, and quality puts the ILX to shame. Having said all that the ILX was a fantastic car, and I do miss certain things, such as the push start, and peppy engine. I would still highly recommend it to anyone in the market.

acura,ilx,2018,john, 08/31/2018,smaller is better,pos,"I had been driving an Acura TL and then TLX's for the past 13 years and I enjoyed most of the features across the board. Despite the average ratings for the ILX I took it for a test drive and I liked everything about it, so I bought it. I am very pleased with the overall performance, handling, style, etc. The UBS port is very awkward to access, the bluetooth voice is poor, and the screen graphics are not so good. Also, if you are over six feet tall you will have to lower your seat otherwise your head will be hitting the roof.

acura,ilx,2018,Nicole, 12/04/2018,Acura ILX 2018 MAJOR ISSUES,pos,"This is my third ILX because I LOVE this car, everything about it including the price was on point. However, I recently leased a 2018 and since day one I have had problems. Second day I had it, the car stalled in the middle of end of day traffic. Come to find out that there are problems with the fuel gauge and electrical panel on the 2018 ILX that I was unaware of. Currently, I have to fill my tank every 200 miles until the part comes in. It's been over a month and a half, and I am still waiting for the part to come in to fix this issue.  My car has stalled 3-4 times, hasn't started on several occasions, and frankly I am not happy. Maybe its the way I am being pushed to the side, and Acura dealership hasn't even offered a loaner or to replace the car, but this is BS.

The seat are not even manual on the passenger! It’s doesn’t have push start remote like civil or has navigation even the back up cam don’t have a beep sounds! It’s very very low grade then a Honda civil! Really not worth the price and quality!!

acura,ilx,2019,tom lordi, 01/16/2019,What's Not to Like?!,pos,"Great looking, and handles beautifully, and Made in America.  I am a bit disappointed in the electronics interface; all features are not as intuitive as I'd like and will take me on a steep learning curve.  It is feature packed - one of the reasons I purchased it - but again, the controls could be more intuitive.  Particularly impressive are the eight speed DC transmission, handling and the relatively quiet ride.  It's all I could have wanted and more at that price point.
"
acura,ilx,2019,Fritolay, 01/26/2019,Acura ILX or Honda Civic Si?,pos,"In my opinion, for about the same price, you get an Acura ILX which is based on the 9th Generation Civic vs. the current 10th Generation Civic, which is slightly larger and has about the same performance.  So why not buy the Civic?  Because the 9th Generation Civic was a tried and true model which was extremely reliable (read the reviews on the current 10th Generation Civic).  Additionally, you get a VTEC engine instead of the much reported problematic Earth Dreams engine (read about fuel & oil issues), a dual-clutch transmission instead of the expensive to repair CVT transmission, and new refined styling unlike the love it/hate it polarizing Civic styling.   In a nutshell, you get a very reliable Honda Civic Si without the reported problematic components, which is dressed in a fancy new tuxedo with nicer paint and a better warranty.  A wolf in sheep's clothing.

acura,ilx,2019,Capt Larry Reimer, 03/15/2019,3rd Honda - this one in Acura Suit,pos,"I've owned 3 Honda Products - a 2012 Civic Si Sedan, 2018 Civic Hatchback Sport Manual and now this 2019 ILX A-Spec Sedan. I've read the Reviews which mostly pan this car as a ""warmed-over 9th Gen Civic"" - take it from a past owner - this is NO Civic - it has Honda reliability with the tried and proven 2.4L NON-Turbo engine and a really great Dual-clutch 8 Speed Auto. As a Manual Fan I can say this DC Auto is really nice and I'm not missing the Manuals anymore. To give some factual and real-world comparisons based on experience and facts - I bought a new 87 BMW M5 sedan in 1987 - owned it for 10 years and 65,000 miles. If you'll check for yourselves you'll see that the exterior dimensions are almost exactly the same as this ILX - M5 was 256HP (inline 6) with 5-speed Manual where ILX is 201HP (inline 4) - M5 weighed 3450 lbs - ILX weighs 3144. M5 did 0-60 in 6.7 sec - ILX does 0-60 in 6.6 sec. The above are facts, not opinions. Have owned alot of HP machinery since trading my M5 in 1997 - and can honestly say I feel I've given up almost nothing between the 2 cars, and the M5 cost me $48,000 in 1987 and the ILX cost me $31,000 in 2019......32 years later. Don't believe the reports - this ILX A-Spec may be the Sleeper of the Quarter-Century. It's admittedly not ""today's fast"" but it sure is fast enough for me..................

acura,ilx,2019,Fred, 07/17/2019,By far the best sports sedan for the $$$!,pos,"I test drove many competitors before I settled with the 2019 Acura ILX- A-Spec - Tech.  For around 32K this loaded great looking sports sedan is a blast to drive. It's fast enough, handles great, the steering is a perfect balance not to loose (like most new cars these days) and not too firm.  I test drove the Lexus IS, Infiniti Q-50, Audi A-3, Benz   CLA and A-class, BMW 2 and 3 series, Jaguar XE, Genesis G70 and the Volvo S60.  These are all WAY more expensive to buy or lease with less features.  While they all drove fine (except for the CLA), the ILX proved to be by far the best sports sedan for the $$$.

acura,ilx,2019,Ken in Oregon, 02/13/2020,Some features make it a pain to own,pos,"We have owned three other Acuras, all of the TL family --and '03, '07 and a 2016 TLX. This go-round we decided to downsize to the ILX. I wish we didn't. We chose to go Acura after comparing to the Honda Civic, which wasn't as nice and had a much inferior engine-transmission package. But the 2019 ILX, while nice, isn't as nice as the TLX. Seats aren't as comfortable. The memory seats don't remember me very well. Seat heaters are either on or off, no degrees of heat. The ILX drives pretty well and if you keep the revs up can even feel a little sporty. Our biggest complaint is the size of the gas tank. It's barely over 10 gallons; the TLX had 17+. Where my wife had to the fill the TLX once every 6 weeks, the ILX barely makes three.

"
acura,ilx,2020,Rob, 05/14/2020,2020 ILX an Incredible Vehicle,pos,"Before purchasing this car, I did a TON of reading both professional and consumer reviews as well as watching YouTube review videos. Some professional reviewers get behind the wheel, floor the gas pedal, and then say it's noisy and not fast enough. But the truth is most drivers don't floor the gas in everyday driving. For a driver like myself going to work every day in a normal commute I found the car to be very quick and it also gives a quiet ride! The transmission and engine work very well together for an incredibly smooth driving experience, and both have proven long term reliability. The styling is great, and the fit and finish is quality. It's a very solid feeling car and mine has absolutely no squeaks or rattles. The ELS stereo system with surround sound blows me away and it's the best sound system I've ever heard in a car. The lower touch screen is solely dedicated to the sound system with integrated pandora capability as well as XM radio. The upper screen is dedicated to navigation as well as apple car play and android auto. Reviewers like to complain about the dual screen set up, but I think it's great! My one and only complaint about this car is that the navigation is very dated looking, but hey it works well anyway. The best part about this car is no doubt the value for the money. Compare it to other premium brands and you will pay thousands more, and you really cannot compared it to a non premium model such as a civic because it's truly a cut above in fit and finish. In a way it's in a class all by itself. Also great is that the cost of repair and normal maintenance is nowhere near what you will pay for other premium brands. So all in all I know I made a great decision in buying the ILX and look forward to driving this fun car for many years to come.
"
acura,ilx,2020,Scott, 07/04/2020,The Best Car I've Ever Owned,pos,"I first saw the ILX at the auto show near me in February and was immediately drawn in by its styling, logical controls, and price. My daily driver was a 2011 Civic at the time, which had been consistently reliable and had a nice character to it. (It's now my second/backup car; why get rid of a perfectly good vehicle?)
Honda's reputation for quality and reliability was the first factor in my decision to look further into this car. When I started researching it, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. Then I realized what they were comparing the car to. This isn't one of those cars that young people drag down the freeway. It's also not an Audi or Mercedes in terms of price (I even cross-shopped the Mercedes-Benz A220 along with the Honda Accord). 
What this car truly represents is a step between mainstream vehicles (Accord, Camry, etc) and full-blown luxury (BMW 3 Series, Audi A4). It's a spot which, at one time, belonged to the Oldsmobile Cutlass. You bought a Cutlass to step up from Chevy and after you had your performance car phase with Pontiac. It wasn't a Cadillac, but you didn't need a Cadillac--just something that was a little nicer than your Malibu. Oldsmobile (and Mercury, for that matter) are long gone, so many people have trouble placing a ""step up"" model these days.
What the ILX gives you is a car that is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and is easy to use. Controls are often difficult to figure out on new cars; even something as simple as shifting into drive can be a challenge for someone who hasn't bought a new car in a while. The ILX uses traditional controls and was very easy to learn, even coming from a low-tech model like a 2011 Civic. It's also nice to see a car with a non-turbo engine and a regular automatic transmission rather than a CVT. You even get a CD player. Some of us appreciate the old-school touches like that, especially knowing what long term reliability and proven performance look like!
I have no problems with the interior materials, and I even sat in the A220 and rented an Evoque last year! The leather is high grade and the plastic, in no way, feels cheap. The steering wheel has a very nice feel to it as well.
The dual screen setup, to me, is a huge perk. I worked with a similar system on an older Accord a few years back and I'm shocked Honda seems to want to phase it out. It was easy to learn and works very well. Again, it's a proven winner.
Regarding comparisons to Civics--I have a Civic and have driven the current model. These are two entirely different vehicles in character and refinement. The Civic may have more performance options in the Si trim, but if you're buying the ILX, you're probably looking more for refinement, not to win a drag race. That's what this car gives you--a lot of luxury in a small package. Just because it's derived from the Civic doesn't make it a Civic. Remember, the CR-V was also derived from the Civic platform and is an entirely different vehicle. As a longtime Civic owner, I can also tell you that being related to the Civic is a good thing. Aside from age-related maintenance like a muffler and brakes, my Civic has never let me down, 145K miles later.
I drove an Accord as well and it's a similar car in terms of feel, but smaller. In fact, the ILX feels more like a small Accord with a few refinements. A comparably-equipped Accord is bigger, but $5000 more. If you don't consistently haul around passengers but want the luxury, go for the ILX. The Accord is a little bit quieter in terms of road noise if that matters to you, but also has a steeper learning curve with some controls.
To sum this up: test-drive the ILX and see for yourself what a wonderful car it really is. I've enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of mine since purchasing it and am looking forward to having it as my daily driver for a long time.

I Initially looked at the Lexus IS but it was $10,000 more and didn’t have all the standard features that my ILX did. Test drove it and it went above my expectations and I ended up taking it home. 😂😂 The only negative I can think of so far  is the infotainment system which can be confusing at first.
"
acura,ilx,2020,LawyerDave, 04/11/2020,Neither here nor there,pos,"I was leasing a Mazda3 premium plus. I loved that car and was inclined to get the new redesigned one, but had some negative feelings about the Mazda dealership experience. Against my better judgement I looked at the Acura ILX. Let me just saw that this car is inferior to the 3 in virtually every respect, and in some ways vastly inferior. But first, the positives: the headlights! This car has the best headlights ever. They illuminate the road extremely well under any circumstances such that I hardly ever use my high beams. Next, the value: it's easily the cheapest ""luxury""vehicle one can lease and you do get a great amount of tech for the money as long as you step up to the quite affordable premium package. Apple Carplay? Emergency braking? Lane departure warning? Sunroof? You've got it! And finally, the seats. Extremely comfortable. Everyone who sits in them makes the same observation. Now, the negatives: IT'S NOT A LUXURY CAR!!!!! Rear windows aren't automatic. Seriously? My Mazda had a vastly superior interior. It also had a vastly superior driving experience. Acura's DCT is a horrible transmission, never seeming to know which gear to be in at lower speeds. It hesitates before downshifting and flutters about annoyingly, irritating the driver and probably wasting gas. The 3 also ran circles around this car in terms of handling. The ILX does not do well in the twisties and the noises it makes and general way it behaves just does not inspire one to test its limits and push it harder. It's not completely awful but feels a lot more like a Toyota product, or maybe even an old Buick. Steering/handling are vague. 
Last but not least, the heating system: the weakest I have experienced in any vehicle, period. Unacceptably bad. I will leave it at that. 
One may wonder why I got this car given the above. It came down to price. Truthfully, I am paying less to lease it than I paid for the Mazda. And it is very cute looking. People tell me that all the time.

acura,ilx,2020,Tiss Uuu, 07/03/2020,"Luxury, AFRAID NOT, but it'll work for awhile",neg,"After owning it for 2 weeks my opinion is it looks great, engine has plenty of pep, steering is effortless but the road feel is distant. LED Lights are bright plus it has many of the safety collision warning features.. As for the build quality my impression is it's poor. Hood uses a metal rod for support, no shock/stay hood lift. Floor mats are very poor quality, Walmart's cheapies at least have rubber backing. There's NO SPARE TIRE! Instead they give you a small air compressor. NO jack or lug wrench but it has wheel locks. So when your sidewall blows or your flat has a hole bigger than a finish nail ensure you have someone who can bring you a new tire! Or be smart remove the foam parts holder where the spare goes and buy a temporary spare and scissor w/lug wrench and put it in it's place. I'm original owner of a 2003 CL-S 6cyl v-tech 6spd manual which is a much sounder and more exhilarating to drive which I'm keeping for fun.

acura,mdx,2001,Tango Papa, 07/19/2016,210K miles - going strong - paid for itself,pos,"Bought this brand new when it first came out in 2001 when my daughter was born so we had space to change baby diapers in the back and was safe for the whole family. It was a fantastic new car on the scene. Well, 15 years later, my daughter is 15 now and learning to drive and she will inherit the MDX as her first car to drive around. It has 210K miles on it. Its mostly been trouble free. Transmission went at 129K so was out of any warranty. (Apparently the early models, including mine, used a GM transmission as Acura had not quiet gotten their transmission ready for the car, later models used Acura transmission). The transmission rebuild cost $4500 but included a special attachment to the radiator to resolve the heating problem that these transmission had. On this second transmission, the car is now at 210K miles and it looks like it would probably do another 20K-40K without much problems. Changed battery 4 times (we live mostly in hot climate). Changed Tires 4-5 times. Changed brakes twice. Three timing belt jobs. One 100K tune up. Countless air filter and oil changes. Leak in power steering fixed (twice). A/C hose replaced. Engine mounts replaced under warranty. Catalytic converter went at 160K miles...feel I have spend $6-7K on all the repairs and normal maintenance over the years including wear and tear items like Battery, Tire, Brakes , Wipers etc....that works out to less than $500 per year which is not bad at all. I feel part of the issue with car trouble is crooked dealers who try to get you to replace items which don't need immediate replacement. Unless its an obvious problem impacting safety and drivability don't replace the item unless you are convinced it needs replacing. Car still looks new after 15 years. Amazing paint job. And guess what, didn't like the look of the new 2014 MDX so bought a nice new Range Rover - very fancy - but after 2 years and  numerous problems, I traded it in for an UGLY but hopefully much more reliable 2016 MDX. New 2001 MDX touring bought for $37K in California in 2001. New 2016 MDX Base model bought for $39K in Texas in 2016...which was $5K off the MSRP due to up coming model change over.

I'm not the type of person who is a ""complainer"", but believe me when I tell you that Acura is having all kinds of issues with the torque converters on their transmission.
Most of the time, the issues show up right after the warranty.
The dealership (McGrath Acura) will give you the run around and have you contact the Acura Customer Care 1-800 #.
Once you do that, if you complain loud enough they will assign you to a District Manager who will do absolutely nothing to satisfy you.
If you're smart, do a simple Google Search on Acura transmission issues and see what comes up.

I was fortunate enough to find a one owner trade in with very low miles, with regular service.  I thought despite a couple of annoying short comings of the first model year, that I'd have it for years to come, but no longer. AC hose replacement at 60K miles/ $1K. Power steering 83K mi/ $600. Transmission 84K mi/ $6000. Nav system & CD multi disc changer both broken.  People still think it looks like a new car. I got several good years out of it, but for a Honda, this last year's reliability has been horrible. It should have lasted longer before the cost to repair was higher than the value. I may never go back."

Acura and dealer for something more,

dealer.  They said, ""No thanks.""

I questioned trying a first year model, 
in 2001. 

Know that replacement tranny was not 
immeidiately available when my 
repair was done Dec.'02.  Seems that 
Acura is having more wide spread

Acura extended warrany from 50,000 mi.

I got the dreaded P0740 code twice in 3 days.  The car had to go and I'm pretty sad about it.  The car has been fantastic.  Of course, I had to do regular maintenance, replace a computer module, and A/C compressor.  I would say that's pretty good for owning a car for 15 years and 204k miles.

In 2004 while still under warranty the car began making a vibrating noise. This was very intermittent and the local dealer was unable to replicate the problem. The problem has gradually gotten worse. With 77,000 miles on the car I finally discovered the transmission needed replacing. Acura ¨customer service¨ informed me I would only have to pay $1180 of the $3800 repairs. They explained that I didn't always get the car serviced at Acura. In the next sentence they said they weren't responsible for the local dealer not being able to diagnose the problem."

Best upgrade ever.  More room, comfort, visibility than the jeep.  I found the seats especially comfortable since I had a bad back.  Good handling in wet weather or snow, but would not want to take it offroad.  Has carried my family for 155K and convinced me that my next car will be the same one (not the newer smaller version).  No reliability issues, predictable maintenance.  "
acura,mdx,2001,domer1976, 02/09/2009,"Based on 90,000 miles, and 6 years of",pos,"ownership, I can honestly say I'd buy the car all over again, in a heartbeat.  Pluses are comfort, still class-leading navigation system, interior room, and build quality.  Mine has always been dealer-serviced, which hasn't been particularly cheap.  Transmission went kaput at 90,000 miles, and I neither tow, carry loads nor abuse the transmission in any way.  Would have been more disappointing, but Honda Motors - which apparently knows they have problems with this transmission, paid for half the cost of replacement.  Abundant wind and road noise and unimpressive gas mileage (about 18 mpg combined)are about the only drawbacks.  And you'd better have a wide garage door to fit it in."
acura,mdx,2001,Disgusted with Honda, 03/09/2010,Second Trans Bites the Dust,pos,"I just sold my MDX to a dealer for $4,000.00 after buying it for $24,000.00 just 5 years ago.  After two transmissions, one computer, and a couple of sensors, I must admit I am through with Honda! I bought it for reliability thinking I would get the regular 200,000+ miles experience and barely got 100,000. This would have been my second transmission in 2 years if not for selling it off. This is disgraceful for an auto manufacturer that boasts quality and charges exorbitantly for it but doesn't deliver. I basically enjoyed the car. It was reliable. I'll miss it.  But not the sorry crappy transmission problems. I hope Acura/Honda corrected this problem."
acura,mdx,2001,Great Vehicle, 04/13/2010,Great Vehicle,pos,"I now have 168,000 miles on this MDX with virtually no problems, except 1.  Two years ago, the Torque Converter went out.  The dealer indicated that it would cost about $5,000 to repair unless Acura stepped.  The dealer, Butler Acura in Ashland, Oregon contacted Acura and asked about it.  Acura agreed to replace the entire transmission and torque converter (new, not rebuilt) if I would cover the labor cost.  The car had 132,000 miles on it at the time. That is standing behind a car.  The warranty was only for 100,000 miles, but they felt it should not have gone out, so they replaced it.  The car does have a bit more road noise than I would like, but otherwise is a great performer!"
acura,mdx,2001,MDX Lover, 08/27/2003,Best Mid-Size Luxury SUV on the Market,pos,"I have owned my MDX for just over two
years now logging 39,000 miles.  Before
I purchased it, I looked at all the
mid-size luxury SUVs available,
including BMW, Mercedes Benz, and
Lexus--I have not been disappointed in
my selection.  It's been a teriffic
vehicle--comfortable, powerful,
efficient, reliable, versatile and
stylish (conservatively so).  I have
owned Acura/Honda vehicles for more than
twenty years now and will continue to
own them as long as they continue to
offer the same performance and reliability."
acura,mdx,2001,ACURALOVER, 06/08/2004,MDX Owner,pos,"I have owned this vehicle for 3 years; 
never had a problem even once. It has 
always been a reliable trusty vehicle. 
The interior is very comfortable, and 
the third row seats are pretty roomy 
(for third-row seats). Cargo carrying 
capacity is amazing with both the 
second and third row seats folded 
flush into the floor."
acura,mdx,2001,leslie ingle, 11/01/2010,Acura MDX 2001,pos,"Purchased used from a dealer with app 40k miles on it.  Was great for a couple of years and then at 95k, I had to have the transmission replaced.  Acura did replace because of recall and I only paid a $400 labor charge.  Very disappointed that now at 145k miles I am hearing the same noise and know it is again the transmission.  I will never by another Honda or Acura.  I have owned Toyotas previously and never had any major problems.  Going back to Toyota but in the meantime I feel stuck with this car.  Can't sell it with a faulty transmission and do not want to pay for new one.  "
acura,mdx,2001,alabamafamily, 03/23/2009,195K and still going strong,pos,"This is the best car I've ever owned. I'll roll 200,000 miles sometime this summer, yet this car has NEVER let me down.  The only time it's ever been in the shop was for air conditioning problems.  Even then it was a minor fix.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone considering it!"
acura,mdx,2001,amc, 09/16/2008,"I was a big fan until 80,000 miles",pos,"I bought this car from another dealership and was instantly thrilled with this car.  However, I am appalled that after hitting 78000 miles, the car started mild rpm surging and am also being told I need a torque converter.  I was impressed with another write up that I had the same experience, lots of $ to diagnose the problem.  Interior plastic buttons for lights and vents, broke apart. Same experience as others.  I have never replaced a transmission on a car in my entire life.  This is so discouraging."
acura,mdx,2001,Acura enthusiast, 08/03/2002,Best SUV Available,pos,"I shopped the RX300 and X5 along with 
the MDX (excluded the ML320 because of 
reported reliability horrors).  For the 
price, the other two couldn't compare.  
Although I heard stories about price-
gouging and rude dealer behavior, my 
experience at Jeffrey Acura in 
Roseville, Michigan was perfect.  Since 
obtaining it, I have gone on several 
road trips, endured two winters, and 
moved to a new state.  The MDX 
performed perfectly in all conditions 
and can really haul a load of stuff!  
This is my 7th Acura, but not my last."
acura,mdx,2001,dec, 08/05/2002,MDXcellant,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 30,0000 miles 
and 23 months. I am completely 
satisfied with my decision to purchase 
it. I disagree with Pete, above. I 
think the interior is simple and 
elegant. There is nothing ""cheap"" about 
it. The workmanship is equal the Lexus 
and better than the German competition."
acura,mdx,2001,Cav Man, 12/11/2002,Don't believe me go for a Test Drive,pos,"Go drive them all Envoy, Pathfinder, 
Explorer,etc and then drive a MDX.  
After you drive the MDX you will 
say ""why did I waste all that time"". A 
great vehicle that speaks for itself--
power,looks, room & fuel economy."
acura,mdx,2001,al's mdx , 01/04/2003,Great Vehicle Lousy Service,pos,"Vehicle excellent is spite of dealers 
lousy service and rip offs."
acura,mdx,2001,ifetayo, 07/17/2003,MDX is TIGHT,pos,"Overall performance and value for the 
price, is awesome compared to its 
competitors."
acura,mdx,2001,aylien, 08/28/2003,Don't get Black,pos,"Our car is great it has been on many 
road trips. It seems to be holding up 
well. The only complaint I have it the 
exterior dents very easily and the 
black paint scratches easily. Some 
scratches are unavoidable with black, 
but Honda black never seems to keep 
it's luster for very long. I was hoping 
they would use a better paint on the 
Acura but it is the same as our Honda. 
I have a black BMW and it does not look 
as bad as the MDX. It seems to be 
holding up in every other way. Great 
vehicle!  "
acura,mdx,2001,Acurate Rating, 10/01/2003,SUV for Smart buyers not for name seeker,pos,"This is a vehicle for someone who 
cares about the quality (and by 
quality I mean the Consumer Reports, 
the reliability, the high resale, the 
inexspensive replacement parts, the 
excellent highway safety reviews) of a 
vehicle and not the logo on the hood.  
If you want to impress the Joneses, 
buy a BMW or a Mercedes, but if you 
want a car that's leaps-and-bounds 
above those names, get this one."
acura,mdx,2001,Pilot 11, 10/25/2003,Great Car,pos,Best car that I have ever owned.
acura,mdx,2001,flpaindoc, 12/12/2003,Very good value,pos,"almost 20,000 miles an no problems at 
all. I have enjoy this car. "
acura,mdx,2001,Michael F. Miller, 01/08/2004,Retirement present to myself,pos,"I did a lot of research before buying 
this vehicle. I have not been 
disappointed! It is fun to drive, nice 
to look at, and the resale value ain't 
bad either. I am starting to look at 
another vehicle, a 04 MDX. I just have 
to have that back up camera! Do not 
doubt this one, buy it!"
acura,mdx,2001,Bronx Bomber, 03/04/2003,I'm Happy,pos,"The MDX rides pretty smoothly. Also has 
decent pickup. I think the handling is 
decent. Purposely drove it at a high 
rate of speed to test braking and 
maneuverability. Although lane 
change is not as smooth as in a 
car. It is a lot smoother than most 
other trucks I have driven.(Rx300,Chevy 
Blazer, Pathfinder and a Passport) Of 
course I don't recommend anyone trying 
this. One complaint. I was told 
that on hills the MDX had some sort of 
mechanism to help stop roll back. I was 
on a (not so) steep hill earlier and I 
happen to take my foot of the brake. 
Immediately the truck began to roll 
backwards down the hill. SO much for 
that anti roll back feature."
acura,mdx,2001,BCroamer, 02/04/2004,A great SUV,pos,"We've owned several different makes of 
high-end SUV's and the MDX is the 
best.  When all aspects of ownership 
are considered; price, size, 
performance, comfort, resale, etc, the 
only thing that comes close is the 
Lexus LX470 and it's cost is 
considerable higher.  

The NAV system is the best, we travel 
extensively and wouldn't be without it.

We've had it off-road and while not a 
true ""rock-hopper"" it does very well.  
In the snow & ice it really shines.

We're very pleased with our purchase."
acura,mdx,2001,Lino, 02/16/2004,Excellent,pos,"I purchased this vehicle from Carmax 
and it has been a workhorse.  I also 
purchased the extended warranty and 
have had to use it once (engine mount & 
AC system).  I may never purchase 
another brand again!"
acura,mdx,2001,Debbie, 06/01/2006,MDX- dependable and fun,pos,"I was one of the earliest MDX buyers in our area.  I love my MDX!  It has been dependable, comfortable and low maintenance.  I put a lot of mileage on yearly and have been thrilled with the vehicle!  I am now first in line for the new RDX and am anxiously awaiting its arrival!  I hope it is as good as my MDX (but with the kids grown up and out, I no longer need a 7 passenger car).  I highly recommend the MDX!"
acura,mdx,2001,Gillian, 03/09/2003,Love the MDX,pos,"I waited 4 months for my dream MDX and 
I'm pleased with it.  Minor issues--
the steering wheel radio controls have 
been repaired/replaced twice and still 
don't work right.  Not keen on the 
sheer amount of bass coming out of the 
sound system either. 

Car handles well in all weather and 
road conditions.  It's a heavy vehicle 
so it's not as nimble as some similar 
size SUVs but it's solid, stable, and 
dependable. 

Vehicle holds 7 people easily although 
the third row is not comfy for anyone 
over 5 foot.  

Overall, one of the best vehicles I've 
ever owned."
acura,mdx,2001,Ric, 07/30/2005,"wow, what a great SUV!",pos,"I've owned an SUV since way before they weere called SUVs and this Acura MDX is a thing of beauty, style and performance. The Jeep Cherokee leaked oiil after 3 years and quit running whenever it felt like it, the S-10 Blazer was ok, but was under powered and nearly roled me over when I got T- boned from someone doing about 15 MPH.  The Rodeo was about to trash it's transmission after only 55,000 miles of pampered use, blah, blah.  This MDX is peppy, stylish and rides like a dream."
acura,mdx,2001,voytekwp, 11/30/2005,Used car lemon .....,neg,"I traded my Toyota 4Runner & Land Cruiser for two MDX  (for me and my wife). What a mistake. After 50-60k I need to repair or replace: two transmissions (recall), front struts, 3 times SRS systems components, front damper springs (recall), EGR valve (recall). This 2001  MDX is a lemon and Acura Client Department is no help ."
acura,mdx,2001,Nate, 09/10/2006,Sell by 90k,pos,"We bought the MDX over the BMW X5 only because of the third row seating.  We loved the car untill 90k miles.  We have replaced two front struts $700, two motor mounts $600, SRS electronic part $520, spark plugs - Acura wanted hundreds to do them so I did the work. Timing belt and 110k service was over $1000. I am tired of the warning lights comming on every time I turn around.  Only dealer can turn them off. My miles are 90% highway on the Acura.  "
acura,mdx,2001,Richard, 03/03/2007,Awesome SUV,pos,"I purchased this vehicle with about 56000 miles a couple years ago.  I have had no issues other than a small coolant leak which was covered under warranty.  The car is smooth riding and fun to drive.  I pulled a 20 ft boat with ease, I could not even tell it was behind me. I even took it on some light 4 wheel drive excursions and it performed great. Plenty of room for 7 passengers.  Gas economy is about average on mine, clocking in at around 18 mpg. I do have a few gripes. Mirror weeps after washing vehicle causing serious water spots down the side of the car when you drive it after washing. Also, some annoying rattles which went away after purchasing new tires. Great SUV."
acura,mdx,2001,anne, 08/27/2007,Wow,pos,"I have been driving this car for a month and I can't believe the comfort, driving control. It feels like a sedan to drive and it is 2001. The touring package is fabulous and everything works perfectly after 7 years. It feels like a new car and road-holds better than the 2008 pathfinder which I also drove.  "
acura,mdx,2001,SDS828, 04/30/2003,My First SUV,pos,"Test drove and personally rated about 
a half dozen mid-sized SUVs in fall 
2000.  Selected MDX over others for 
basically 3 reasons - best/most 
useable room for hauling (make 16-20 
trips/year of 600-800 miles carrying 
lots; hauling stuff in-town), ULEV 
rating, and best value compared to 
others driven.  Perspective - previous 
car Toyota MR2!"
acura,mdx,2001,bigir, 03/13/2002,pdxmdx,pos,"Great all around performance for an SUV. Great road handling and Road Manners. 
Appointed nicely."
acura,mdx,2001,craigo, 08/13/2008,First 100k OK,pos, Have had this MDX for 7 years. Great car. The tranny has been slipping under load (hill) for a while and the dealer can not find the problem. Going in for a timing belt this week and I hope they find the tranny issue this time. Love to buy another but the $$$ is crazy.
acura,mdx,2001,Beachkid, 07/07/2009,Love it!,pos,"I bought the car the first month it was available in 2001. I now have over 167K miles on it and it's going strong. I too received a new transmission during the recall so I should have several good years left.  I love the versatility of the vehicle. From sheets of plywood to trees!  I won't buy a new one again but will consider a used one or possibly a CR-V. My husband loves his CR-V and I don't mind driving it but my MDX has just a bit more luxury about it -- if you're willing to pay the extra $$.  Might even consider a Toyota. But I've been driving either Honda's or Acura's since 1984..so it might be hard to change now.  The MDX handles very much like a car, and I've really enjoyed owning it."
acura,mdx,2001,Barb, 12/15/2009,Love it!,pos,"I've had this MDX for almost nine years (brand new with 14 miles on the engine) and have thoroughly enjoyed owning and driving this SUV. Dealer replaced the transmission about 75K miles ago.  Love the strong, stable feel when driving in snow & rain. So roomy and comfortable for trips. Even though I no longer need such a large vehicle (the kids are grown & gone now) I most likely will get another MDX only I will buy used this time. I have over 175K miles and am seeing just how long/far this car will go. Have had most of the preventive maintenance performed which can be pricey but still haven't found another SUV I like better."
acura,mdx,2001,Robin S, 06/05/2005,Saving My life,pos,"Two days ago I totaled my MDX, hitting a telephone pole head on. Fortunately thanks to a power greater than I and the structure of My MDX, I left without a scratch. I won't drive anything else. I had purchased my 2001 MDX used and loved it. Functions like a minivan, drives like a sports car and has the top of the line luxury that I love. No problems with the car @ 60 plus thousand miles. I look forward to purchasing my next one. "
acura,mdx,2001,dave, 12/02/2006,Amazing car,pos,"I bought this car used with 92,000 miles; it now has 120000 and I have had no problems with it. One of the best, most reliable, fun to drive cars on the road."

shifted from 70 MPH to second gear 
causing the car to decellerate to 55 
mph rapidly and almost cost me my 
life. I quit!!!! I have read there is 
Chrysler like Tranny probs with this 
and other Acura models. I have 100,000 
miles on mine. Theres danger in your 
future. Dealer in VA tells me it's 
common! Acura, does someone have to 
die before you recall this????????? "
acura,mdx,2001,SS, 05/03/2009,"Excellent Car, will only buy an MDX",pos,"A friend had a new 2001 MDX and loved it so I bought a pre-owned 2001 in 2005 with 44K miles.  I loved this car!  I had almost 72K miles and someone t-boned us going about 40 mph.  The car was amazing how it protected us.  The airbags went off but other than that, no damage in the interior.  Unfortunately our MDX was totaled.  We are replacing it with another MDX.  We are not even considering anything else.  In the 4 years I had the car, we have had absolutely no service calls or problems.  Love the smooth ride and security it brings while driving."
acura,mdx,2001,willyiam, 05/04/2002,Best Luxury SUV!,pos,"We have owned our MDX for about 14 
months now and driven it in all kinds 
of weather & conditions. It is a 
superior piece of engineering and 
drives beautifully. It was rated as the 
top luxury SUV by Motor Trend, Road & 
Track and Car & Driver and well 
deserved.  With the large cargo area 
and the fold up rear seats, it is the 
perfect family vehicle. Seating 
configuration changes in a matter of 
seconds. All other options are well 
thought out. We had a DVD system with 
an 8"" wide screen added which is great 
for trips.... Couldn't be happier with 
a vehicle!"
acura,mdx,2001,Alicia , 12/26/2007,Acura 2001 MDX,pos,"Bought my 2001 MDX back in 2003. Have never had any major problems with it.  I love the MDX, very sporty for the money.  Engine light came on and took it to the dealer.  It needs a new transmission.  It only has 79,000 miles on it.  I have followed all the maintenances on it, changed the oil every 3,000 miles.  Just so discouraged at this point.  Not sure how this happened. "
acura,mdx,2001,HowardB, 05/21/2002,Great partner,pos,"Collected my (wife's) MDX from Houston -
 Nav. system was perfect for my return 
to Manhattan.  Average speed something 
north of legal, fuel better than 
23MPG.  Next, we (wife, mother-in-law, 
baby, 2 cats, 12 fish and loads of 
luggage) drove to our new home in 
Houston.  Again - high speed, great 
mileage.  Since then - to Raleigh NC.  
No problems, no dramas, great ride..."
acura,mdx,2001,Car Lover, 01/16/2008,Hurrah for the MDX,pos,"Now this car is one story. The build quality is extraordinary. We got the thing used, four years strong and we still haven't needed to get it repaired. The tires get replaced soon though. The comfort is okay, the leather interior is nice, but the third row seat in the back is not made for adults! The reliability is good, too. It is there for us every time. Fuel economy is not too bad. 20 mpg average. Better than we all expected. Just be careful of that trip computer. Very fragile. Plus, for some odd reason, the radio's LCD starts blanking out in the summer. It always returns after a firm hold on it. Nice car."
acura,mdx,2001,pgweiss, 06/15/2002,My MDX,pos,"I love my MDX.
The interior is great and the ride is 
great.
One of the best features ins the 
navigation system, and of course the 
way the car looks."

acura,mdx,2001,claire1, 08/28/2002,Best Vehicle I've Owned,pos,"After 25,000 miles, I still like the 
MDX more each day. It's comfortable, 
powerful, versatile (because of the 3d 
row seats).  The handling is wonderful, 
and the controls are convenient to 
use.  It's excellent in the snow.  The 
leather is holding up well.  It's a 
perfect car for my family--we have 2 
preteen kids.  There are plenty of 
cupholders and lots of room for their 
friends.  A great car."
acura,mdx,2001,2MINPINS, 11/05/2002,Still Getting Asked How I Like It,pos,"I have owned many Honda cars and am so 
glad I returned to the Honda family.  
The solid build quality of the MDX 
makes it a comfortable pleasure to 
drive whether to and from work or on 
long trips.
The vehicle's performance many times 
lets me forget I am driving an SUV and 
not a sportscar."
acura,mdx,2001,srs, 11/08/2002,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"Couldn't be happier. This vehicle has 
been a joy to own and drive. Its 
flexibilty is wonderful. I have not had 
single problem with this SUV. I had a 
Land Rover previously and had 
numerous issues with that vehicle."
acura,mdx,2001,David O'Brien, 07/31/2002,The Perfect Vehicle,pos,"This vehicle has it all.  While it is 
technically a SUV, it handles and is as 
comfortable as a car.  I call it the 
perfect vehicle because it suits all.  
It seats 7 very comfortably without 
being too big, it has plenty of power 
with excellent gas mileage.  Plus, it 
is an Acura which will have excellent 
reliability and resale."
acura,mdx,2001,bp, 06/19/2002,buy it you will like it,pos,"Best SUV I have ever been in!  More I

like mine. HOMER"
acura,mdx,2001,Joy K, 10/13/2002,Just My Opinion,pos,"Real happy with the look and 
reliability of the MDX.  Wish it didn't 
need premium fuel.  Get lots of 
compliments on it wherever we go.  I 
think it has too much interior noise, 
but I think that got improved in 2002."
acura,mdx,2001,Michele, 02/13/2008,Will buy one all over again,pos,"My 2001 MDX is nearly 7 years old and has 180,000 miles.  Looks like new.  I don't consider the 100,000 mile tune up at $1500 a big tag item to keep this baby on the road.  Did get a new tranny during the recall a few years back and that is okay.  If I am ever in a place to need a new car, I will go for a used 2006 MDX.  But at the rate mine is going, I should be able to get another 100K out of her easy."
acura,mdx,2001,HappyinNOLA, 11/30/2002,HappyOwner,pos,"I went from an Audi convertible to the 
MDX and I am so happy that I didn't

Honda/Acura quality and I am 
constantly complimented on the style 
and luxury of the car."

Misc. accessories (cap cover for wheel, various interior lights,always needing to be replaced. Material used in interior does not wear well.  Spring is trying to protrude through seat back.   Poor transmission (been replaced once and may need another).  As much as this car costs, interior should hold up better.  This is my second Acura--may be my last."

almost 18 mpg city."
acura,mdx,2001,herzjb, 06/30/2005,Love returning to my MDX after a flight.,pos,"Love this car. I have 60,000 miles on it now. Dealer has fixed second gear under warranty via recall. Ride and performs like a car. Sturdy interior. Plenty of cargo space, cup holders and power outlets. Good entry level sound system."
acura,mdx,2001,Randall69, 02/04/2004,Dissapointed in Acura,pos,"I must have a lemon. The transmission 
had to be completely replaced after 
six months.  The brakes are extremely 
noisy and make a consistant clunking 
sound every time you shift. Acura 
claims this isn't a safety issue and I 
agree.  It is,however, annoying and 
loud and makes the vehicle sound 
cheap, which at $40,000 dollars,itis 
not. These experiences have provided a 
very disappointing experience, 
especially since this is an Acura. I 
got more reliability from an Explorer."
acura,mdx,2001,olaiz1977, 03/12/2004,Overall great SUV,pos,"There are three small details I've had 
with my MDX.
1.- Wind whistles into the cabin at 
high speeds
2.- Driver's seat is not very good for 
long roadtrips.
3.- A/C fan switch is not easy to use.
The only other comment is about its 
towing capacity. I purchased the towing 
package (which by the way, all accs. 
are very expensive) and can only tow 
about 3,000#.  If you plan to tow a 
small boat, or anything else, look for 
something else. 
Off-road is so-so.  It VTM-Lock allows 
for front wheel slip while not really 
locking the back tires.
If you dont toe and dont off-road, this 
is the best SUV you can buy"
acura,mdx,2001,Jen Tow, 06/07/2006,Perhaps the first year had more lemons,pos,"Excellent vehicle for city drivers who need a large car.  Runs smoothly and has huge carrying capacity. It is not a good 4x4.  My previous car, a jeep grand cherokee, was far superior off- road.  The Acura transmission overheated on one trip (luckily it has a light on the dash that warns you). On another the power steering failed (luckily the new steering rack was under warranty).  The huge coil spring on one of the wheels even broke going over a regular pothole.  It is rather delicate, not rugged.  But if you keep it on paved roads you will enjoy the smooth ride, quiet engine, easy to use rear seats and cargo room."
acura,mdx,2001,Yancey, 04/18/2004,Transmission Problems,pos,"I have enjoyed my MDX but I have had a 
transmission failure at 36,000 miles.  Acura 
did not cover the failure because they stated 
that I had a third party transmission cooler 
placed that voided their wonderful warranty. 
The AAMCO dealer that replace the 
transmission for $6000 told me that the 
cooler was not the problem.  I have also had 
a friend that had a transmission failure at 
$40,000 miles.  The local Acura dealer was 
not only unhelpful but downright indignant."
acura,mdx,2001,kcooper, 08/08/2006,my first real car,pos,"I say this is my first - as it really is the first good car I've gotten my hands on.   I have also owned the Jeep Cherokee FWD and the Acura is way beyond in options, handling and quality.  "
acura,mdx,2001,lbclagett, 07/21/2005,Best Luxury SUV,pos,I purchase a 2001 MDX and Love it.  It has all the features and a great price.  It is a perfect daily driver and road trip car.  It was my first of many.
acura,mdx,2001,dsippin, 03/17/2003,Best Vehicle Ever Owned,pos,"We are complaetely satified with our 
MDX. A perfect mix between luxury car 
and useful SUV. Handles great, 
extremely comfortable, and quiet. I 
think the milage is great for a vehicle 
of this size- it gets over 22 mpg 
highway. Also, we do use the Nav system 
all the time- a great system! The only 
thing I miss is that low-end punch you 
get from a V-8. Definitely not the last 
one we will buy."
acura,mdx,2001,MDX, 01/29/2006,love my mdx,pos,"My mdx has proven to be the best suv and best car I have ever owned. It handles like a small car and can turn on a dime. Great for hauling the kids to soccer practice and school. More than just roomy but comfortable too. Great CD player, six disk, with 12 speakers. Kids love to ride in the car. I had the first in our area and people were always asking about the car. Neat middle information screen, TV like. Looking forward to the 2007 model that is when I will be buying my new MDX "
acura,mdx,2001,Paul, 01/28/2007,Pretty much perfect,pos,"I wish I could be more constructive, but it is hard to think of anything wrong with this vehicle.  We were faced with the decision of buying a new, midscale SUV, or a used, upscale one like an MDX.  Boy, are we glad we bought the MDX.  If we didn't know, we'd think it was brand new.  Do the homework, and you'll find that the MDX offers the most interior room (including a 3rd row seat) in a package that is still midsized.  If you want the ability to haul kids all around town in a safe, AWD SUV, but don't want a Yukon or Expedition, then this is the rig for you.  There is no comparison to the RX 300, which is tiny compared this this (on the inside)."
acura,mdx,2001,FC, 01/27/2007,Acura Quality Questionable,pos,"Bought used 55000 and it filled up with water in first rainstorm - bad caulking on firewall seals. Broken front spring replaced. Oil jet kit installed. Tach surges 50-100 rpm every 2-3 seconds - dealer cannot diagnose after hundreds of $'s - now thinks it is torque converter. EGR valve replaced on warranty. Plastic vent controls snapped off. Rear wiper droops. Brakes cost > $600 to fix. Road noise excessive. Stereo system is weak. Fuel mileage is poor, especially in city.      "
acura,mdx,2001,RHornsby, 08/30/2007,A Fairly Solid SUV,pos,"We bought this car to replace a Dodge Caravan (yeah, I know). It is an excellent car as far as looks and overall driving goes. However, for the large price, it has had a surprising amount of problems. We have had to get multiple things fixed. It now has around 92000 miles on it, and it has broken a couple of times.   It has good acceleration with the V6, and is a solid performer (good handling, acceleration). The interior has had a few problems (seats falling apart, window motors breaking) but overall it is a roomy comfortable car. Gas mileage is okay but it has a large tank.  It is a very wide car though, feels a little sluggish after driving sedans, but is safe."
acura,mdx,2001,LUVING IT, 07/21/2007,It Drives Like A Car,pos,"I bought this truck last September with 138,000 miles. So far besides a tune up and a driver's side wheel bearing. I have had no problems with this vehicle. I moved from Connecticut to Atlanta and it drove with no problem even though it had so many miles on it."
acura,mdx,2001,Rorytug, 06/22/2003,Love It,pos,"Honda has long been known for quality 
and 2001 filled my dreams when they 
entered the SUV market in a big way.  I 
was set to purchase a Lexus 300 and am 
soo glas I had waited the estra year.  
MDX is dollar for dollar a much better 
product! The MDX is luxurious, 
comfortable, powerful and drives like a 
car with the benefits of the SUV.  It's 
disign is solid with small things like 
where the Homelink buttons are located 
set it above.  "
acura,mdx,2001,hopper2g, 06/22/2003,Excellent X,pos,"Purchased new in 2000. Nothing but 
praise for Acura and this vehicle ever 
since. Our family has really enjoyed 
the MDX. There is plenty of room for 
all passengers and their gear while 
keeping them comfortable and safe. 
Still amazed by the sheer volume of 
interior room compared to the outside 
size. We get 25 MPG on the highway and 
its ULEV."
acura,mdx,2001,miklo714, 07/01/2003,Perfect crossover SUV,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 2 years now.  
I was originally attracted to it 
because of the amazing price-feature 
ratio and the excellent test drive I 
had.  You can turn this car completely 
around in less space than just about 
all sedans.  The MDX accelerates and 
drives very smoothly - I am always out 
of stoplights way ahead of other cars 
and I'm not trying to race or 
anything, its just natural to go up to 
45 in a few seconds in this car.  "
acura,mdx,2001,Dinah, 07/08/2003,It's a Perfect 10,pos,"Long or short trips, this car is so 
comfortable, whether driving or just 
riding.  We like it so well, we are 
buying another new one."
acura,mdx,2001,Carl Lam, 03/15/2002,01 MDX Touring & Nav,pos,Solid build and performance.  I drive it pretty much like driving a sports sedan. Fuel economy is good for a vehicle this size.  HUGE interior space.  A little bit noisier than expected at this price level.  Navigation system is a delight.
acura,mdx,2001,Matt R., 03/19/2002,Very Happy after a full year!,pos,"My wife and I had narrowed it down to a MDX, a Pathfinder LE, and a 2002 Explorer Eddie Bauer/Limited. The MDX worked out to about $10k more than the others, and we're both very happy we spent the money. The SUV has LOTS of room, the third row seats work very well. We've had flawless operation since new. All in all, this isn't the best in any one area (others are faster, bigger, smaller etc), but the best combination of featers for those looking for an SUV that won't be visiting the Rubicon Trail too often!"
acura,mdx,2001,DonnyDjr, 03/25/2002,The MD-X Rules,pos,"The MD-X is by far the greatest SUV made when comparing performance, value, reliability, resale price, looks and quality. The wait is well worth it."
acura,mdx,2001,blaws, 03/28/2002,Excellent Vehicle!,pos,"This is truly an excellent vehicle.  Fit and finish are flawless.  The engine is very responsive, has plenty of power, and transfers that power to the wheels very well.  I am averaging 16-17 mpg in town, and over 23 on the highway.  The ride is somewhat firm, but without letting you feel excessively jarred or beat up.  Handling is also tight and responsive.  The Navigation package could use a little improvement.  Overall, in my opinion, Acura has a winner here."
acura,mdx,2002,grammyjan1978, 01/06/2014,LOVE LOVE LOVE this 2002 ACURA MDX TOURING,pos,"I drove this, loved the looks of it, and it has 187,000 and counting. I would buy another one just like it...got it at 54000 at dealer certified and have had no issues whatsoever. I love my Acura.
My only question...I just drove to work and for the first time I clicked the four wheel drive VDX button, how can you tell if it goes off...I clicked it and no change...got me to work in 13 inches of snow..."
acura,mdx,2002,bill_tiffany_jr, 03/07/2009,02 MDX,pos,"The MDX has been great although the 02 is well known for transmission failure. Mine gave out at 60K. There are hundreds and hundreds of similar stories, even at much lower mileage levels.  You will here a ""burr""ing sound between 40 - 50 MPH while traveling in 5th gear.  Talk to your dealer and to Acura customer service in order to get a new transmission heavily discounted or best case, for free, even when you are out of warranty."
acura,mdx,2002,davesocal, 04/19/2012,Don't be a Dummy from 3 Transmissions,pos,"Bought this MDX new with all options.
 At 55,000 had the transmission replaced using my extended warranty (1 month shy of expiration and any work done under the warranty or extension it is only good thru the end of the extension date, meaning I only had one month of warranty on the new transmission).
This transmission died at 88,000 mi.
6k replacement from the dealer, which was whittled down to 2 thousand.
 This car has been babied thru the dealer servicing since purchase.
 Service managers admit the design is faulty.
And mentioned I was lucky to get this much use before the transmissons died ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CAR USED !!!
YOU WILL HAVE A PROBLEM !!!"
acura,mdx,2002,hdavis39, 12/29/2010,Worried after reading......,pos,"I love my MDX. I am worried now that I have read the significant issues people have had with their transmission. I pray that I will not. I have over 163,000 miles on my car now and have never had any major issues. I changed the timing belt just to avoid future problems when I did a major maintenance. I will say with regard to safety that this vehicle has been safe. I have six children and I have had several people hit me and I rear ended someone once. The only damage to my car were mere scratches. It is built like a tank. Maybe I will be one of the lucky ones but so far I cannot complain. This is the best car that I have ever driven."
acura,mdx,2002,Tom, 08/10/2010,Transmissions,pos,"Stay away from this vehicle. Buyer beware. I had my tranny replaced at the dealer after numerous issues, in fact I had to take it to a different dealer who said yes after 109KM it needs a new tranny. Now I need another 139 KM it died. I called Acura? Honda Canada only to be told too bad it is past warranty (which it is). I repeatedly told them that there have been major issues with this model and specific problem to which the reply was. No there hasn't!  Please Google 2002 acura mdx transmission issues before you make a major mistake. "
acura,mdx,2002,jbirken, 05/15/2013,Great Car!,pos,"I bought my 02 MDX new from the dealer.
I have had it now for 10 years and have over 235K miles on it.
No major repairs at all.
I read about transmissions, struts repairs, etc but I have seen none of it.
A great family car.
Very reliable.
Never failed me.
The transmission finally went recently (no complaints after 235K miles) and I want to get another one.
I do get worried from what I am reading here at times but for me the car was well worth the $$$ spent."
acura,mdx,2002,jj0103, 04/15/2010,BEWARE: Bad Transmissions,pos,Nice vehicle but not withstanding of the reputation of Honda's reliability. Transmissions have known issue under NHTSA recall 04V176000 of gear failure that could result in transmission lockup. This happened to me at 113k miles after Acura said they fixed the issue. While driving 35 mph the front end of the vehicle seized and skidded 5-7 feet. Luckily there wasn't a car behind me. They tried to charge $7k to fix the transmission. It appears there are 100's of similar cases reported online and Acura is using plausible deniability to avoid litigation issues. I logged a complaint w/ NHTSA & sold vehicle due to safety concerns. 
acura,mdx,2002,WALTER BRINEY, 05/09/2016,A little old ladies darling,pos,"I wouldn't even consider selling it accept for wanting all the new safety equipment that is now available. No issues with repairs other than scheduled maintenance. We liked it so much that we purchased a second one just like it accept it is a 2005 model.
I don't like that you must use premium fuel in it.
"
acura,mdx,2002,Elizabeth, 03/23/2010,The wonder car,pos,"Our family was in an accident on the freeway, where we lost control of the car due to slick road surface and were hit 2 times by other cars as we spun toward the fast lane.  When we took stock of each one of us in the car, we were all okay.  One of the airbags went off and the car was totaled.  The next day, we found another Acura MDX and are very glad to drive such a safe and reliable car.  We are certain many other cars would not have protected us in that situation."
acura,mdx,2002,twelborn, 11/11/2011,Very Happy With Purchase So Far,pos,"My dad and I found this 2002 Acura MDX with around 101,000 miles on it for around $12,000. Was a little off-put with the miles at first, but after I drove it I absolutely loved it. Luxury cars' engines last better than normal cars, you get a better car for the buck too. It provides smooth acceleration and provides an overall very comfortable ride. Was using unleaded-plus fuel at first, but then the ride got a little shaky. Switched back to straight-up premium and the engine performance and fuel economy became much better. I love the Bose sound system in the car, good and clean audio deliverance. Very happy with this car. As long as you do regular maintenance, you shouldn't have problems."
acura,mdx,2002,Mickey, 06/15/2008,Best mid-size suv on the market period!!,pos,"I love my MDX and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone. The styling, features, performance capabilities on this vehicle was everything I could have hoped for. Driving the MDX you feel like your in control of the road. It hugs the turns like a race car. The MDX is sporty, safe, and very roomy inside. I love my MDX!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Ken, 02/16/2010,Three transmissions!,pos,"My wife really liked the Acura's size and features. When we first got it, it certainly was smooth and quiet; much more refined than the 1996 Grand Cherokee we had before. It was a good size and she loved the touchscreen navigation. It was a little disappointing that the MDX didn't have some luxury features that the six-year old Jeep did, like automatic headlights and day/night outside mirrors. Overall she and I liked the car. The trouble started at 37000 miles when the first transmission went out. It was replaced. It broke again and was replaced at 87000 miles and we discovered this is a well-known and chronic problem with Acura's transmissions. I cannot recommend early decade MDX's."
acura,mdx,2002,JohnA.Feer, 04/16/2006,decent car...Terrible transmission,pos,"This car is a good car short term. After my second year owning this car a bunch of lights came up on the dashboard. After getting it checked, weeks later the transmission starting to fail. acura has honda products including the transmission, and honda is known for the worst transmission. The car starting bucking and did not get into gear, and would have trouble reversing. Very comfy, nice options, but just bad transmission, and sunroof."
acura,mdx,2002,David Kirchhoff, 09/21/2015,Transmission blew at 170K.,neg,"At the purchase price (could have bought a houseboat for the price), it should go 300K miles, IMHO!
Apparently Honda had trouble with the 'hydraulics' on automatic transmissions at the time they did this one. If they had not, this review would not be clouded by a transmission failure.
"
acura,mdx,2002,Tom, 01/03/2010,Buyer Beware,pos,"Tranny went at 66,000, and I am having problems again at 140,000! If not for this major issue I love it. Gas mileage OK "
acura,mdx,2002,Barry, 04/22/2010,I have better cars.,pos,"We currently have 133,000 miles. We have replaced far too many things to say this is a used car best buy. The tranny went at 99k, motor mounts at 110k, wheel bearings at 99k, shocks and struts at 115k, rear heater stopped working at 80k, it's starting to rust in the wheel wells and the list goes on. The motor mounts and tranny are a known issue on these cars. RECALL IT! Dealer said to me ""Hey, you got your use out of them"". I didn't realize parts expired.."
acura,mdx,2002,happysuver, 02/26/2002,Best SUV,pos,"The MDX handles and drives so much better than any other 7 passenger+ suv it's not even funny.

Great convenience not having to remove the seats - we can still put 3 kids in the middle row - and fold down the rear row if need be."
acura,mdx,2002,gensaco, 11/26/2006,2002 Acura MDX Touring,pos,"After owning 9 vehicles this being the 10th, I find it to be the best yet. Considering I was hell-bent on buying a hybrid suv, I'm pleasantly surprised how easily I changed my mind after taking mine for a test drive. I love it more each time I get in. Hate to get out when I get home, could drive it forever. All the interior controls are placed well for easy access. Roomy interior. The ride was a tad stiffer than an Equinox but I do love the way it handles. May be due to too much air in the tires. Great on icy roads. Nice tight turning radius. Unless they make drastic changes, I'm fairly certain I'll buy another in 3 yrs. All the bells & whistles are great. The MDX fits me like a glove."
acura,mdx,2002,no more acuras, 08/28/2010,I feel betrayed,pos,"Let me start off by saying I loved my Acuras. Had an RL that was the best i owned. It failed on me and traded for the MDX. Loved the MDX, best in class, dream car. Then the probs w the tranny started. Thank God I bought it certified. 100 mi before expiration they replaced it free, but right at 12 mos later it's crapping again. I feel like my spouse cheated on me. For something I love to cause me this much pain, I'll never buy another Acura. To fix it will cost more than I owe it. They may  have gotten better, but they lost me for good this time.  The RL was bad enough when I replaced the window motor on 3 windows and at 105k the engine died. Can you tell I'm bitter? Sorry, i don't want to be."
acura,mdx,2002,sadmatt, 08/27/2002,Honda should stick to motorcycles,neg,"What a joke.  Service, and all dealers 
just downright rude.  So you wait four 
months to find out the thing starts 
sometimes and not others.  I can see 
why Toyota is the largest and richest 
automobile producer in Japan.  This 
overpriced mini Van (what was I on when 
I bought this?) is just that.  Buy a 
RX300 and be done with it.  If you need 
to haul anymore than that wait for the 
new bigger Lexus.  The service and car 
is much better."
acura,mdx,2002,vegas, 02/10/2006,Disappointing,pos,This was one of the more disappointing vehicles that I have owned.  Vehicle clunks when shifting from forward to reverse (dealer says it cannot be repaired).  Can't drive with the windows down as it creates pressure inside vehicle. The list goes on.
acura,mdx,2002,bfoley80, 04/30/2012,Lemon from the factory,pos,"Bought the vehicle brand new off the lot and from day 01 the vehicle had issues, i.e. bubbles in the paint, EGR
valve recalls (numerous), etc.
The latest is the transmission.
This is the second one in 160K miles.
The first one was under warranty & the second was while still under warranty as well, however the Sunnyvale Acura dealership did not identify it and has now changed ownership & they're not taking responsibility.
The repair will be between $5K~$7K.
This is the 1st and last Acura which I will ever buy.
They use the term ""Luxury Vehicle"" - don't be fooled.
My prior Lexus was a true Luxury Vehicle, over 250K miles on the trannie w/ no issues."
acura,mdx,2002,RCTANNING, 10/07/2003,MDX Touring with NAV,pos,"We researched, and test drove them all.
The MDX on our first trip was a dream 
to drive.  The car type ride, 
performance ,luxury feel, full size, 
and egonomics sold us.
26 MPG freeway driving. I and friends 
strongly recommend it."
acura,mdx,2002,Mr Singapore, 09/04/2002,Stuck on a Hwy.. Engine Check,neg,"How can a new MDX like my just stuck on 
a Hwy.. The engine just let go while I 
am driving around 130km/hr.. The engine 
check light is on and I just got enough 
time to direct my car to the ramp.. 

This is not fun and a major safty 
issue.. I WON'T buy ANY ACURA anymore !

The roadside assistance and dealership 
services is nothing compare to Infinit 
provide.."
acura,mdx,2002,Norick Baboomian, 05/16/2002,noisy noisy,pos,"Its a ok suv to have, couldn't wait to 
buy it. But for a $45k suv I could buy 
a quieter suv. Lots of wind and road 
noise. The armrest is not comfortble 
while driving. Should have waited 
another year so I can get an improved 
2002 model. Acura doesn't take the 
responsibility to upgrade it, so I am 
not happy with their service. One of 
the victims of a first year production 
car buyr."
acura,mdx,2002,Maneesh N Patel, 06/22/2002,Serious Raders only,neg,"This brand new SUV has been to garage 
twice.Very poor service.They drove the

to fight for it.Rude staff.
DO NOT EVEN THINK OF THIS ACURA>"
acura,mdx,2002,Jerry D. Gibbens, 07/03/2002,Wind noise is ATROCIOUS,pos,"My 2001 MDX has been a DISASTER from
the second week.  I get TERRIFIC
wind noise at speeds in access of
60 miles per hours.  The dealership
smiles and works on the MDX, but they
wind noise continues.  I have had
the RUN AROUND from the Acura
National folks.  I would DEFINETELY
NOT buy another ACURA."
acura,mdx,2002,Puma, 08/18/2002,Good quality built in North America???,pos,"The car is well biult but a few inches 
too high.  Sunroof too small for this 
size of a car (much smaller than 
competiotion). Lumbar support very 
primitive, not effective."
acura,mdx,2002,JYMDX, 11/04/2003,Too many unexplained noises,pos,"I like the MDX, like the way it looks, 
like the gas mileage (but not the 
required premium gas).  The only 
complaint I have so far is the noise 
the brakes make (which we're told is 
normal) and little rattles that appear 
out of no where. It sounds like it's 
metal hitting metal somewhere in the 
second row seats.  The slighest bump in 
the road brings on the rattle.  The 
dealership was unable to find 
anything.  Currently I have an old 
towel rolled up between the seat the 
metal piece that it locks onto.  So far 
this week, I haven't heard the noise 
again.  If I don't get rid of this 
noise, the car will have to go because 
it drives me nuts!"
acura,mdx,2002,mikelevels, 05/23/2006,Hope This Helps,pos,"I did a lot of research before buying this car. I got the list down to MDX and Pilot, the Honda version of the same car, because I carry large speakers and needed a 49"" wide car. There were no used Pilots at the time, so the MDX was it. Like everyone else, I had the transmission problem and eventually had it replaced under warrantee with no questions asked. Make sure you buy a certified car with an extended power train warrantee. Great highway cruiser. 4 hour trips are no problem. If it got stolen, I'd get a Pilot to replace it. "

acura,mdx,2002,megabuck2, 04/10/2002,188 MDX,pos,"Had a chance for a long drive from the 
SF area to L.A and comfort and 
driveability was excellent. Engine was 
strong in passing as well as climbing 
the ""Grapevine"". 
The seats were comfortable during the 
6+ hours of driving. HVAC was set and 
forgotten and kept the cabin nice a 
cool, navigation system helped to find 
my hotel. Bose system, I enjoyed it 
immensely during the trip. However, it 
seems the radio was weak in getting and 
holding onto radio signals. The road 
noise was kept to minimum but the wind 
noise was annoying. It was not ""LOUD"" 
but loud enough force me to turn the 
volume up on the stereo to enjoy Eric

days time. I test drove atleast 4 times 
on highways and local roads.  I also 
tried Lexus RX300 and did'nt like it. 
MDX matched all my requirements!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,BoosHound, 04/11/2002,Excellence,pos,"Acura has outdone themselves!  The 
recent (and moderate) design changes 
clearly state that Acura has made a 
superior SUV with little room for 
improvement!"
acura,mdx,2002,RocinRob, 04/12/2002,Pure excellence,pos,"I have to say, buying my New Acura MDX 
was a smart decision. I paid more than 
sticker and I would do it again. This 
SUV drives like a car, handles rough 
roads in NYC with ease and dosen't toss 
me around like the competition does."
acura,mdx,2002,Mad in Big D, 07/16/2008,2002 Acura MDX,neg,"I just bought an MDX. The transmission died within 30 days! 4500.00 to fix! NO MORE ACURAS for me. And, it is the SECOND time! First replacement was in 2004"

acura,mdx,2002,mattb, 09/03/2008,"Fun to Drive, but Expensive",pos,"My first time with a luxury SUV, which I researched prior to buying.  At 40K miles, the transmission needed to be replaced!!! But they did it thanks to buying it pre-owned, pre-certified - would have cost 7K.  This car handles very well and has gotten me out of more than a few accidents. Power about right and handles extremely well, is extremely comfortable."
acura,mdx,2002,GRuss, 04/27/2002,Wife's Car,pos,"For the last 15 years my wife has 
driven a couple of different SUV's and 
she says she'll stay with the MDX.  
Handles great in snow and ice. Smooth 
on the highway."

it's just so smooth and comfortable."

design, excellent driving habits, very
useful for trips and other"
acura,mdx,2002,Freddie, 11/22/2008,I Would Buy Another,pos,"My husband and I test drove several SUVs before selecting this one.  We selected it in part because it has the drive and comfort of a car unlike the truck feel of many others.  The body style is great (didn't change for a few years).  We like the reliability, overall style, navigation system, and mileage (is still very good).  After 143,000+ miles & over 7 year it still looks and drives great.  A new transmission was installed a few months before the extended warranty expired so we incurred no extra cost. No other major work has been needed. Two times the navigation malfunctioned but shortly corrected itself. We need to update our navigation CD because some locations can't be found."
acura,mdx,2002,smart guy, 05/13/2002,Smooth sailing,pos,"I purchased this vehicle after 
comparing with other SUV's.  I 
particularly liked the ride quality and 
luxure amenities vs. other SUV's I 
drove. Acura has put together a nice 
blend of funtionality and luxury."
acura,mdx,2002,MarkinOlneyMD, 05/14/2002,Sure beats my ML430!,pos,"An amazing vehicle and purchase 
process.  Very professional and well 
treated by dealership (unlike my former 
Mercedes dealer --  traded in a 2001 ML 
430, which was a piece of junk).

My wife learned all of the controls in 
no time -  very logical and well laid 
out.  The most versatile vehicles we're 
ever owned in terms of flexibility.  

The salesperson noticed a rip in the 
leather passenger seat during the 
delivery process (probably from the 
mechanic who prep'd the vehicle). 
Immediately ordered a new seat cover, 
which was no problem."
acura,mdx,2002,maxmax54, 05/14/2002,Much better than ML320,pos,"I had a Mercedes ML 320, this car is so 
far superior to that truck I cannot 
begin to think of the ways. The many 
visits to the snotty Mercedes dealer 
are a thing of the past (thank god!). 
My MDX is three months old, I had 
already been back to the Mercedes 
dealer three times with the ML 320. 
More room, better interior, quieter AC, 
no wind noise, no pieces falling off, 
no comparison!"
acura,mdx,2002,Ray 2000, 05/23/2002,Exceptional Vehicle for the money,pos,"Superb interior, fun to drive, drives 
like a car not a truck."
acura,mdx,2002,Indiana Xmom, 05/28/2002,Best 7-passenger SUV,pos,"The MDX is the perfect combination of 
reliability, versatility, and fuel 
economy, with seven-passenger 
seating.  This vehicle has all the 
advantages of an SUV, all the features 
of a minivan, and a smooth, 
comfortable ride.  It's fun to drive 
with great acceleration, and handles 
very well in all weather situations.  
We love it!"
acura,mdx,2002,JackieCar, 05/28/2002,Lifesaver!,pos,"We bought this vehicle Saturday, May 
25, Monday May 27th, a lady driving a 
2002 PT CRuiser rammed into us.  We had 
very small damage on our bumper, the PT 
Cruiser had to be towed (which gives 
you an idea of what happened to it).  
Nobody was hurt, our two small kids 
were in the 3rd row, and everybody was 
fine.  This may be a pricey vehicle but 
well worth it's price since our most 
prized possessions (our kids) were safe!"
acura,mdx,2002,paul654, 05/31/2002,Amazing SUV,pos,"Excellent vehicle drives like a 
towncar lifted up in the air. 
Excellent power and excellent sound 
system. The Navagation is the most 
accurate and easy to use, 1 disk 
covers all 50 states. Plenty of room. 
Amazing gas mileage. Nothing bad to 
say it's great, if you can get your 
hands on one. High demand and short 
supply."
acura,mdx,2002,Aaron, 06/04/2009,Mixed Bag,pos,"After looking at a ton of Suvs I finally decided to go with a 2002(55k) MDX. Everything was great with the car until strange noises started to occur. Mainly between 35-40mph. It sounded like running over rumble strips. The problems just got worse from there. Rough shifting, clunking, etc. I went and tried to find an answer for this problem and discovered that transmission problems in these vehicles are pretty common. I love this car but the transmission is a HUGE issue for me. I am very disappointed with this vehicle and I will not be buying another Acura product."
acura,mdx,2002,Landshark, 06/04/2002,Mini Van on Steroids,pos,"The wife and I got ours when our son was just a month old.  We love the mini 
van like room combined with Acura style, performance, and quality."
acura,mdx,2002,Bman, 06/05/2002,Value for your money,pos,"Traded in 98 Acura TL for extra space, 
went back to Acura for reliability & 
comfort. This thing is a dream to 
drive - good power (particularly for 
weight of vehicle), smooth 
transmission, great handling, very 
comfortable/convenient. Looks great 
inside and out - catch a lot of people 
taking notice when you drive by. Let's 
face it, SUVs aren't cheap, but you get 
your money's worth with this one."
acura,mdx,2002,oc mom, 06/06/2002,Exactly What we were looking for,pos,"My husband and I looked for over a year 
for a new vehicle that would accomadate 
an expanding family but not burden our 
limited garage space with a removeable 
3rd seat. We have very specific 
requirments; COMFORTABLE 3rd seat that 
folded into the body, enough cargo 
space for possible mid-size furniture 
purchases, great safety rating, good 
gas milage, and it had to feel like we 
weren't driving a school bus. THE MDX 
FIT ALL OF OUR REQUIRMNET AND THEN SOME!
Pick-up is great, getting on the 
freeway in Southern California is not 
longer scary. Visual is great - I can 
see my kids in the back seat as well as 
all the cars around me."
acura,mdx,2002,lokoforever, 06/07/2002,LOKO MDX,pos,"The car has exceeded all of our 
expectations--its very attractive 
inside and out, its very comfortable on 
long trips, and it performs much better 
than any other SUV we've ever driven.  
The Acura Navigation System is well 
worth the money!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Bradley Johnson, 06/11/2002,Why I Love My Acura MDX,pos,"I truly love my Acura MDX. It is the 
most invigorating vehicle to drive, 
with extreme power and comfort. I have 
driven many SUV's, but this one truly 
takes the cake. It is the most 
luxurious SUV out there, and is very 
oppulent on the interior. I cant't say 
enough about it!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Jmac, 06/14/2002,Better than my RX 300,pos,"Had an RX300 before the MDX.MDX much 
better in my opinion. Better turning 
circle, bigger front seats, quieter 
moonroof."
acura,mdx,2002,Wade Kappen, 06/14/2002,2002 Acura Mdx,pos,"I bought my Mdx from acura of orange 
park. the service was wonder ful, and i 
got a good deal. i can say that this 
car is absolutely loaded with features, 
for a good price. it is a good 
performer, highway cruiser, and city 
trasportation. It is very luxurious and 
comfy, and it completely outweighs its 
competition. This car is the best that 
i have ever owned, and i would very 
strongly reccommend it. It is an 
awesome car."
acura,mdx,2002,drhibert, 12/23/2009,3 years and still going strong,pos,"I bought my '02 MDX in '06 with 64,000 miles on it. I have not had any problems with it in the last 3 years. I keep up with regular maintenance - that's it. I can regularly get 20-22mpg around town, and up to 26 highway. Pretty good for an SUV. I'm up to 120,000 miles and it still drives and looks great. There's a weird 'pop' noise when going back into drive after being in reverse, but it's been there since I bought it and has never caused any problems. To my understanding, it is common to most '02 MDXs.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Comet, 06/18/2002,Happy with decision,pos,"I picked up the MDX on Monday and left 
for a trip on that Friday.  Extremely 
pleased with feel, ride (smooth), the 
handling and I love the navigation 
system.  My two children think it is 
great.  Quite a few admiring looks on I-
10.  So far I am very pleased."
acura,mdx,2002,jfxm, 06/27/2002,mdx,pos,"caris btter thanmeedes benz, bmw and 
toyota but needs additional 
improvemnets to make it even better as 
ided in comments below."
acura,mdx,2002,Mile High Dude, 06/30/2002,Nice Ride,pos,"I can easily hold a conversation with 
passengers while going 80 MPH, so it is 
plenty quiet.  I fly with ease through 
intersections with drainage dips, high 
crowns, and ruts, that slam others, car 
or truck.  Where others loose traction 
on rough pavement, bouncing left, and 
then right, the MDX rides through just 
fine.  Maybe that is why the others 
need the off-road low range gears :-).  
They have two hands on the wheel, 
hitting the headliner with their heads, 
while I'm honking to pass.  Nice ride 
Acura, you've tamed the SUV."
acura,mdx,2002,Mark Morrison, 07/02/2002,MDX,pos,"Absolutely excellent in every manner 
possible."
acura,mdx,2002,SDSUALUMNI, 07/03/2002,Searched Forever,pos,"Great car, look far and long for the 
right SUV...Almost settled w/ the BMW X-
5, but glad I went w/ Acura.  Saved 
$15000 and maintenence is much less 
expensive.  30000 mile service on BMW 
is $1200, EVERY 30000 miles (after your 
first 60k).  No buyers remorse 
here...Great SUV."
acura,mdx,2002,MDX Owner, 07/04/2002,Couldn't of Asked for Anything More,pos,"Great SUV!  Acura hit a home run with 
the MDX.  It has all the ammenities 
that you would want (less a DVD 
entertainment center).  Rides and 
handles like a sports sedan, quick 
acceleration, NAVI System is the best 
avail, and passenger/cargo area beats 
others hands down.  I considered BMW 
X5 (3.0) but when you add up all the 
ammenities that are found in MDX 
you're talking $50+K...with less 
room.  A trade off you will have to 
make!  Ask your dealer to chrome your 
wheels....it will make people snap 
thier heads."
acura,mdx,2002,wwong1600, 07/16/2002,Simply less money more value,pos,"Waht a great car. All the thins you 
want from an Suv and the things you 
don't want from a traditional Suv."
acura,mdx,2002,John Q, 07/20/2002,Acura for Life,pos,"This is my second Acura. My first was a 
1990 Integra that I still own with 
135,000 miles which has no rust and 
still runs like a dream. I thought of 
buying the BMW X5, but I couldn't 
resist the MDX. Maybe next time, but 
I'll always have at least one ACURA in 
my garage. ACURA FOR LIFE!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,RCN, 07/20/2002,Simply the best,pos,"We've owned our share of SUV's and have 
test driven about 20 and the MDX bar 
none with the exception of the BMW X5 
compares.  Value, reliability, 
roominess."
acura,mdx,2002,Simon Wu, 07/22/2002,Good car but a bit bumpy than other SUV,pos,A great value for money SUV
acura,mdx,2002,pota, 07/22/2002,mdx,pos,"good, no no, great car"
acura,mdx,2002,Not Acura, 07/31/2002,Not Buying an Acura,neg,"For sure, this vehicle is fantastic in 
terms of price, but the quality and the 
detail of this vehicle is second to the 
bottom when compare to anothers SUVs 
like (Highlander, RX300, ML3s and X5).  
Fake wood trims, unacceptable wind and 
road noise, unprofessional Acura 
salesmanship (went to 3 of them, they 
are all like that, basically Leave it 
or Take it attitude), lack of feature 
and feel of a luxury vehicle.  Though 
it is my parent's car, but I will 
definite will not consider an Acura."
acura,mdx,2002,I LOVE THIS CAR!!, 08/01/2002,Get One!!,pos,"I love my MDX!! Considered Pilot, but 
interior/exterior quality were not the 
same. No sunroof or heated seats in the 
Pilot either!  MDX does not have some 
features you'd expect for the money - 
auto/HID headlights especially, and it 
needs the touring pkg for power 
passenger seat, 6 disc CD, and without 
it roofrack is a $300 option.  Tall 
folks will have trouble finding a place 
for their left foot, and the 
transmission hunts for its gear on only 
slight upgrades.  Overall, I LOVE IT!! 
(Build more, please!)"
acura,mdx,2002,rawman, 08/05/2002,mdx to others,pos,"When I purchased my MDX, I tried all 
the other competitors cars before 
making my final decision.  The RX300, 
though quiet, was too soft and felt 
very small inside, even though outside 
it was very little different from the 
MDX. The BMW was quick, but again, 
very small inside and very stiff in 
normal driving.  The Mercedes was a 
joke.  We bought it at Hopkins Acura 
in Redwood City.  They were great.  No 
markup and no pre-accessorizing.  I 
only had to wait 4 months to get my 
car.  Can't recommend them highly 
enough."
acura,mdx,2002,Ramon, 08/10/2002,I Love My MDX,pos,"We purchased our MDX in July and are 
very pleased with the appearance and 
the comfort of the vehicle.  It handles 
the rode very well and the acceleration 
is excellent for this type of vehicle.  
We just drove our MDX from Annapolis, 
MD to Minneapolis, MN and the ride was 
a complete pleasure.  I also enjoyed 
the number of people asking us what 
kind of SUV we were driving since there 
are not many on the rode compared to 
the Lexus, BMW, and the Mercedes."
acura,mdx,2002,chad frank, 08/12/2002,The MDX is the best SUV I have ever owne,pos,"This is the best SUV I have ever 
owned.  I traded in my 2000 Jeep Grand 
Cherokee for this vehicle.  This is a 
great automobile."
acura,mdx,2002,jag69, 08/13/2002,Fun/ Comfy SUV,pos,"We've taken several long (1600 mile) 
trips in the MDX, and it is comfortable 
and flexible for us (2 Adults, 3 
Children).

Quiet, nice CD player, and easy to 
maneuver, makes it a nice machine to 
operate.  

The key fob actuated seat and mirror 
positioning memory is also very nice as 
my wife and I change off driving.

We were left with a defective battery 
on one of our extended trips.  The much 
touted ""Acura Customer Care"" was fairly 
useless in getting us into a mechanic 
for a replacement.  And it was a 
warranty item, as the cell had a 
defect.  That was frustrating.  

Otherwise, after 27000 miles, no other 
issues."
acura,mdx,2002,Padma , 08/15/2002,My first SUV,pos,"This is my first SUV. I was always 
little hesitant to drive SUVs, I am 
more of a car person. But I was totally 
impressed once I got in to the vehicle. 
And the best thing about is I am not 
missing the family minivan.. right 
after I drove off the dealership, we 
went out of town with my parents and 
two teenage children and some luggage.
No one complained abount being crammed."
acura,mdx,2002,RedMdxMemphis, 08/19/2002,Feeling Great After 9 Months,pos,"I love the MDX after 9 months.  Honda's 
magic 3rd row seat is still the best.   
For daily routine, the ride is just 
smooth as silk. The computerized 4 
wheel drive control is wonderful.  Glad 
to be in this car when it is water all 
over the place.   Honda's quality and 
drive.  we just love it..  for that 
full price, we could not get a BMW with 
7 seats (which they still don't have) 
and navigation, or Mercedez with the 
comfort of driving and convenience of 
3rd row seat.  

MDX accelerates nicely with 24HP.  I 
hardly use the gear shift beyond 4th 
and 5th.  I got used to the size and 
huge inside space.   It is a great ride 
with useful features for home. "
acura,mdx,2002,jcy, 08/19/2002,update 2002,pos,"much improved in noise reduction(I can 
tell the difference since I had owned a 
2001 MDX before I traded it in for 2002 
model) well, still not perfect, wish it 
may enlarge the trunk space 
particularly after 3rd row seat up."

acura,mdx,2002,mdxlemon, 08/22/2002,2002 Acura MDX Lemon,pos,"On delivery MDX it had a rattle which came 
from dashboard area. Took in for service 
and car was at dealer an entire month  (22 
business days). Nav system also blacking 
out intermittently. Took back to Ryan's acura 
for final repair under lemon law and rattle 
was fixed but not nav. 

I requested under lemon law that Acura give
me a new vehicle and was flat out refused. 
They feel I should bring my car back over 
and over for service while getting a loaner 
car with no nav that is worth far less and 
drive around in that.  Lemon lawsuit is being 
filed this week to bring Acura to justice for 
not complying with the lemon law.

Acura just lost this customer."
acura,mdx,2002,GN, 08/26/2002,2001 mdx,pos,"Has drivability problems:

Engine hesitates slightly when first
started, engine cold, going approx. 20 MPH

When engine is at full temp., and parked
for approx. a half an hour, it will not
start. It takes 3 to 4 tries and then
starts and runs w/o a hitch. This has
happened twice within 5 months.
11,000 miles on it.

Acura dealer cannot help.
Also DVD does not have all eastern
cities  in detail such as Naples, FL"
acura,mdx,2002,Dan Carlton, 08/26/2002,BEST SUV EVER,pos,"I Looked for over a year and love this 
car. for the money it is the best bang 
for the buck. Thanks Keyes Acura in Van 
Nuys California.. They deliver."
acura,mdx,2002,pattynjeff, 08/27/2002,Perfect for my wife,pos,"We bought this vehicle for my wife and 
are very happy.  This is a very nice 
daily driver.  Plenty of power, roomy, 
smooth ride, and handles well.  An 
exceptional value, the MDX was less 
expensive than the X5, RX300, and 
ML320."
acura,mdx,2002,drb, 08/27/2002,Good value,pos,"For the money, it is an excellent SUV.  
Others cost more and offer so much 
less.  Wind noise is horrible for 
this ""luxury"" type of vehicle.  
Hopefully honda will fix it with the 
next model year.  A pleasure to drive 
but would be better with more horse 
power."
acura,mdx,2002,Rufus, 08/26/2002,2001 Acura MDX,pos,"As a family of four, plus a dog, we 
have found the MDX to be satisfactory 
in meeting everyone's requirements.  
The towing ability more than handles 
our ski boat.  When we need extra room 
for long trips, we use a roof mounted 
carrier.  The car handles just as well 
with the carrier on top. The only 
performance drawback is the uneven 
accelaration up hills.  It seems to 
downshift frequently when faced with 
any grade of more than a minor degree."
acura,mdx,2002,grotto, 09/03/2002,Efficient but boring!,pos,"Very efficient SUV, falls short of 
being a ""Luxury"" SUV."

acura,mdx,2002,manus, 09/09/2002,Best out there,pos,"I was one of the first to own the MDX 
and never had any regrets. I once got a 
flat in a bad area and Acura Roadside 
Assistance came to the scene and 
changed my tire in less than half an 
hour! Never had any trouble with the 
car, it lives up to Acura's reputation 
of reliability. Performance is amazing 
both on and off road. I truly believe 
some of the other consumer ratings were 
posted by RX/X5/&ML owners. They paid 
thousands more for so much less, I 
don't blame them for their animosity."
acura,mdx,2002,miky, 09/10/2002,Owner,pos,"I loved this vehicle. It is fun to

acura,mdx,2002,slkman99, 09/12/2002,A NEW Acura As Good As The Acura Legend,pos,"This MDX is one of the best 
craftsmanship found on a new car today 
for under $40K. I previously owned a 
Lexus RX300 and let me tell you, the 
RX300 was a horrible car! I'm sorry, 
but its true. If you're looking for 
premium luxury at a great price, go for 
the MDX Premium. You'll love it!! By 
the way, I also own a 94 Acura Legend, 
its the best Acura since the Legend."
acura,mdx,2002,bobarags, 09/13/2002,Excellent auto,pos,"The car is very quiet although road
noise could be lessen.  The interior is
well laid out and very comfortable.  I
like the idea that the 6 CD player is
part of the radio in the dash rather
than the glove compartment or trunk."
acura,mdx,2002,PhotoMan, 09/13/2002,Best Crossover available,pos,"15,000 fantastic mile so far,  drove 
it from Massachusetts to Florida and 
back, 20 MPG average and easily 
cruises at 90+ MPH all day long.  Air 
conditioning is excellent, handling, 
comfort first rate.  It is very quite 
even at 90 MPH.  I'd recommend it to 
anyone"
acura,mdx,2002,abdiver, 09/15/2002,Best SUV in its Class,pos,"Exceeds expectations. Car is easy to drive, 
has good performance, and is versatile. 
Compare to competitors vehicles has very 
few problems for a first year car.  Reliability 
has been excellant thus far.

We looked at BMW (fun to drive but cargo 
area non existent ), Mercedes (3rd row 
seating doesn't cut it), Lexus RX 300 (nice 
but too small), and Chevrolet Tahoe 
(Reliability history). The MDX took all the 
features we wanted and liked, and 
integrated them in a seamless well 
designed, safe, and reliable vehicle."
acura,mdx,2002,Andy M, 09/16/2002,Not a Truck!,pos,"Excellent road performance, especially 
on mountain roads where it is fun!  Was 
considering the Sequoia, but the 
Sequoia drives like a (well designed) 
truck and has the interior design feel 
of a lower level vehicle.  The more I 
drive the Acura, the more pleased I 
am.  The BMW would have been nice, but 
not at the price and with one less row 
of seats.  The dealer we bought from 
was outstanding, but another we tried 
were like sharks."
acura,mdx,2002,newbie2001, 09/19/2002,Experience with my 2001 Silver MDX,pos,"Always gets a lot of glances, on and 
off the road. Several people comes up 
to me to compliment my choice of 
vehicle. Impressive vehicle, never 
regretted my purchase. Am also 
continually upgrading, just recently 
added new body side moulding to my 2001 
silver MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,Rational Buyer, 09/22/2002,A Rational Person's SUV,pos,"I drive SUVs because I need the 
interior storage space for golf 
equipment, antiques and 
garden supplies.  The Acura MDX easily 
offers the largest cargo space of any 
mid-sized SUV on the market. With the 
rear seats down, you can fit a 4 by 8 
plywood sheet flat between the wheel 
wells.  To have this in a luxury 
vehicle engineered by Acura makes this 
a no-brainer.  If you want an SUV for 
the real world, buy an MDX.  IF you 
want a rather useless hood ornament to 
impress your neighbors or prop up a low 
self image, buy an X5 or an RX300."
acura,mdx,2002,chow-chow, 09/28/2002,Accura will also be my next car,pos,"I had owned 4 american cars before, 
they gave me a lot of mechanic 
problems. Inspite of a lot bad commends 
about this MDX, I think this is the 
BEST car I ever own. I got no problems 
with the engine so far."
acura,mdx,2002,ReiverToo, 10/15/2002,I'll buy another,pos,"I love this car...er,truck...er,SUV. 
I've owned it 2 yrs & have found 
nothing that I seriously dislike & a 
whole bunch that's great. I live in the 
So.Cal. mountains & spend a lot of 
driving time on curvy, up & down roads. 
The MDX handles super. It is fun & 
stable to drive. On ice & snow the AWD 
really comes through. It has an amazing 
amount of interior space considering 
the outside appearance. The biggest 
negative with the vehicle is the dealer 
network. Having owned two MB's and two 
Lexi, I've become spoiled by excellent 
service. Acura dealerships(I've been to 
three)are about on a par with Ford. Not 
what you expect of a supposed luxury 
nameplate."
acura,mdx,2002,maxw, 10/15/2002,X5 Beatter,pos,"I have had an extrordinary experience 
with my MDX.  The ride is excellent and 
the most features are convenient. I 
have not been able to get the home link 
to work with my garage door opener, but 
otherwise it has been great.  The only 
bad thing to say is the Acura 
dealiships know they have a good car 
and are sometimes a little arrogant."
acura,mdx,2002,bjg, 10/15/2002,better than the more prestigious names,pos,"I owned and Explorer, Grand Cherokee 
and an X5 before buying this one.  It 
drives extremely well on and off road, 
provides luxury and utility in large 
doses and has a great sound system.  
There is also the added benefit of 
Acura (Honda) quality and I haven't 
even had a small rattle yet."
acura,mdx,2002,jatharp, 10/16/2002,Redrock Pearl,pos,"This is by far the best SUV I have ever 
driven. There is absolutly nothing I 
can find wrong with it."
acura,mdx,2002,first acura, 10/19/2002,Good car for the price,pos,"Did not like the look of Pilot.  Needed 7seats.  Don't want truck based SUV's 
because don't really need off road capability(just rough road cap. is fine).  
Fullsize is too bulky and cumbersome.  Volvo is expensive and has 
questionable reliability.  ===========> Acura MDX was my choice."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXowner, 11/01/2002,A Great SUV,pos,"The MDX is a capable blend of SUV, and 
family car, with a dash of sports car 
thrown in. The exterior styling is 
distinctive and elegant. It looks 
sporty and clean. The touring package 
adds nice wheels and a roof rack which 
compliments the overall styling theme. 
The interior design is on par with most 
cars in this class. It hosts a bevy of 
standard features such as leather 
trimmed seats, 8-way power driver's 
seat, and heated front seats. The 
engine is refined and strong."
acura,mdx,2002,Mct, 11/09/2002,Great SUV,pos,"Great Ride, Suprisingly good gas 
mileage, solid build quality."
acura,mdx,2002,Vance Moore, 06/05/2002,"MDX - Beat out Navigator, X-5, etc.",pos,"Excellent vehicle!  Build quality was 
well above average.  Navigation system 
simple, intuitive, comprehensive.  We 
looked at Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, &   
Infinity.  This was the best overall 
for handling, convenience, and fun!"
acura,mdx,2002,Jason b, 05/22/2002,MDX Review,pos,"This car is great!
The ride is
smooth, quiet, and fun
The MDX has great pick up and good 
horsepower (240)
The only bummer is that it takes 
premium gasoline but it gets good fuel 
economy 19/24"
acura,mdx,2002,imbuer, 10/12/2002,MDX is Best All-around SUV,pos,"After shopping all the others for over 
6 months, we decided on the Base MD-X 
(2002).  We almost bought an X5 4.4, 
but it is too costly and no where near 
enough room, (and the 3.0 doesn't have 
enough power). After almost a year of 
ownership, we like it even more than we 
thought we would.  Incredibly smooth 
and effortless power/torque, great gas 
mileage (up to 26 average on highway), 
pretty good handling (but not quite as 
good as X5), and plenty of room for 
hauling, tailgating, etc.  The base 
sound system is more than adequate, and 
by buying the Base MD-X instead of 
Touring, you make up some for paying 
close to MSRP."
acura,mdx,2002,TYP, 08/23/2002,X!,pos,"It's best for the price, realy
functional well designed car! I've been
follow by cops while driving 80 but they
were just checking the car out, so lucky
no ticket yet!"
acura,mdx,2002,Silvia Suttle, 10/04/2002,Acura MDX - Best Value,pos,"I compared all Mid-sized SUV's and the 
Acura MDX was the best value. I waited 
for about a year before finally 
getting the MDX and it was definately 
worth the wait. I love my car!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Scott Flood, 10/02/2002,MDXcellence,pos,"I have been driving my MDX for 2 years 
and have loved it.  This vehicle is so 
big on the inside and still fun to 
drive.  You can handle it with ease in 
a parking lot or a winding road.  
Better gas mileage than many cars.  I 
have even seen 29.5 mpg on a couple of 
highway trips.  Usually 24-25 mpg on 
hgwy.  I have had it on dirt roads and 
fire trails as well as family trips 
with golf clubs and gear for six.  This 
vehicle is great.  Bigger second row 
than Tahoe and easier to get in and out."
acura,mdx,2002,prl, 10/06/2002,Just the Best,pos,"Simply the best and not a lot of hype. 
Everything they said is true and thats 
what really counts anyway."
acura,mdx,2002,krc21756, 05/05/2002,MDX The Cross Over SUV,pos,"The wait was long (3 months) but well 
worth it.Visibility is excellant. No 
blind spots. Handling is supurb. Body 
lean is minimal as is nosedive when 
braking. The power is awesome. 240 HP 
245ft-lbs @3000 rpm. 80mph @ around 
2000rpm.0 to 60 in 8 seconds not bad 
for something that weighs 4300lbs. 16-
17 mpg city driving! This is the SUV to 
copy and manufacturers are. The 
upcoming Volvo XC-90, The Porche 
Cayenne. The Honda Pilot. Improvements 
can be made and I'm sure they're 
working on it. Quaility is what you 
would expect from a luxury vehicle 
especially when the build only 40,000 
units a year. The automotive industry 
is finally getting interesting again 
after years of stagnating."
acura,mdx,2002,MRH, 11/14/2002,Great SUV,pos,"I have used this vehicle to haul large items 
long distances on the roof;  to carry home 
improvement items and landscaping 
materials; and to carry the family 5000 miles 
on vacation.  There isn't a better, more 
reliable vehicle on the market."
acura,mdx,2002,2002 Black MDX, 11/22/2002,MDXcellent,pos,"We're very pleased with the MDX, it it 
spacious, well designed and extremely 
comfortable to drive.  The 240 hp 
engine provides excellent fuel economy 
and enough power to handle any driving 
conditions.  Can't wait to try it in 
the mountains this coming winter."
acura,mdx,2002,valandshark, 11/25/2002,2002 MDX Touring Nav,pos,"It's been a wonderful SUV.  Good 
acceleration and car-like handling.  
Lots of versitility with the third row 
seating.  The only suggestion I'd give 
Acura would be to have a bit more 
storage space behind the third seats 
(almost none when the seats are in 
use).  I test drove all of the 
competition and it blew them all away, 
and has lived up to my expectations."
acura,mdx,2002,JohnT, 12/05/2002,No complaints at all,pos,"After two years with my MDX I'm pleased 
to say that I have not had a single 
problem with this vehicle.  

It's fun to drive and has a lot of 
space.  I put two child car seats in 
the back and still easily fit an adult 
in that row.

Downside:  It's not truck-like enough 
to be ""cool"" and it's not mini-van-like 
enough to be superbly useful.  I was 
looking for a hybrid of these two 
things and while this is the best 
compromise there is, the MDX is 
not quite the best of both worlds.  

More luxurious than an Explorer, more 
spacious than an RX300, less expensive 
than a BMW, cooler (somewhat) than a 
minivan."
acura,mdx,2002,Flip MDX , 02/28/2002,Awesome,pos,"Strong acceleration, smooth ride, handles like a car, can really do above medium off roading, and only few have them"
acura,mdx,2002,tedpacificNW, 12/30/2002,MDX rules over any other SUV.,pos,"After owning a 99 Ch-eep Grand J-erokee 
for 3+ years and spending WAY TOO MUCH 
MONEY on minor and MAJOR repairs (after 
the warranty expired, of course), I 
purchased the 2002 MDX.  Although the 
price on the MDX is much more than the 
Jeep, I'll most likely be saving money 
over time.  The quality and 
craftsmanship of the MDX is by far 
superior than the JGC and I believe 90+ 
percent of all suv's on the market.  
This is the best SUV for golfers, 
because golf clubs fit like a glove in 
this SUV.  If you're looking for a 
smooth, comfortable, no-rattle, luxury 
ride, this is the SUV to buy."
acura,mdx,2002,RLJEB, 01/21/2003,noisy ride,pos,"We purchased this vehicle for the supposed 
reliability and extra seating capability.  After 
approximately 1,000 miles I began to notice 
a high pitch ringing noise when going over 
30mph.  I have taken the MDX back to the 
dealer 3 times for repair to no avail.  Also, 
whenever I change gears (i.e. go into 
reverse after being in park) the is a loud 
thud when braking.  Dealer tells me this a 
normal characterisitc of the MDX's brake 
callipers (sp?) adjusting.  Who knows?  
What I do know is that I am unhappy with the 
entire Acura experience.  I paid close to 
$40,000 for a noisy vehicle which I do not 
enjoy driving."
acura,mdx,2002,MDX Rocks, 01/22/2003,Very pleased,pos,"Just had our 7,500 mile service, and I 
can't praise this vehicle enough. Great 
power, looks, comfort, reliability. 
Having driven 330 miles through a 
serious snow storm on Christmas Eve, I 
feel qualified to say that the 4WD 
works extremely well. You can buy an X5 
with options to match the MDX for 
thousands more, and you still won't be 
able to do anything about the space 
deficit. The extra seats and cargo 
space are VERY nice to have. If you 
want to be able to say ""I drive a BMW"", 
that's understandable - my wife and I 
just bought a 530i. But if you want 
value, the MDX is the clear choice."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXer, 03/02/2002,Great vehicle,pos,"Bought it 8 months ago.  Great family hauler.  Feels and looks solid. Very comfortable inside.  Very good handling and acceleration.  Excellent crash test results by the IIHS.  NHTSA,although they have not crashed it head on, also gave it 5 stars for side impact crashing and 4 stars for rollover(most SUVs are either 3 or 2).  It comes loaded so the dealers cannot play many games with options.  We looked at the RX 300 but the MDX won hands down in terms of pricing and features."
acura,mdx,2002,ElKay, 02/08/2003,MDX,pos,"We have had our MDX for almost a year.  
We have had no problems with our 
vehicle, and have really found it to be 
better than we anticipated.  We have 
made numerous long trips and it has 
surpassed all expectations."
acura,mdx,2002,R Smith, 03/04/2002,MDX - One of the Best,pos,"There are many SUV's to choose from but if you're looking for a luxury SUV with the best list of amenities you can't do any better than the MDX.  The MDX is one of the few SUV's that offer leather heated seats, a power moon roof, rear seat a/c and heating vents/contols and a third row of seats all standard (touring edition).  It is also one of the few that ride like a car.

These cars are well worth the wait!"
acura,mdx,2002,DallasMDX, 02/22/2003,An SUV for all the right reasons!,pos,"My wife wanted a vehicle that is easy 
to manuever (not a tank!), nice 
looking, has a well appointed interior, 
will haul around our 3 kids plus junk 
and friends, and above all - is safe. 
And, she refuses to drive a van. Well, 
the MDX is the only vehicle that meets 
all the above criteria. And is does so 
with great style, and attention to 
detail."
acura,mdx,2002,Klinie Kent, 07/23/2003,Honda quality,pos,"You just can't beat Honda/Acura 
quality. We researched several SUV's 
before we purchased the MDX and it won 
hands down.  The only other SUV we 
considered was the BMW X5.  The MDX 
third row seat, not to mention about 10 
grand less, made the choice very easy. 
One other thing to look at is standard 
features.  Acura has basically no 
options, it is all standard.  That is 
where the big price difference was with 
the MDX vs. X5!!  Good luck, you won't 
go wrong with anything from Honda."
acura,mdx,2002,ArmyofTwo, 07/28/2003,Very satisfied Honda/Acura convert,pos,"I was looking for a replacement for my 
97 Explorer Limited. Tested the BMW X5 
& the Volvo XC90 both were impressive. 
The BMW had limited cargo space & the 
XC90 felt underpowerd for the weight 
and leary of 1st model year. Tried the 
MDX and found it very roomy, 
comfortable & excellent ""bang for the 
buck"". Great car with the power & 
economy balance that more than 
satisfies me. Friends & family that 
have owned Honda products swear by them 
for reliability & endurance; features 
reinforced my buying decision.  I am 
not a tree-hugger but I am pleased that 
the vehicle meets ULEV standards."
acura,mdx,2002,vranieri1, 08/04/2003,ranieri,pos,"My wife totaled her vehicle and is 
still alive due too the excellent 
safety features incorporated into this 
SUV.

If you have this vehicle consider 
yourself safe and if you want this 
vehicle consider purchasing the MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,SusanY, 08/14/2003,Excellent SUV for,pos,"This has been a fantastic vehicle for 
me and my family.  Comfortable for 
long drives as well as long commutes.  
Gas mileage is good for a large 
vehicle and reliability has been 
perfect.  We see the dealer only for 
scheduled maintenance -- and our 
dealership offers service well beyond 
what we expect every time. "
acura,mdx,2002,WifesSUV, 08/16/2003,? paint problem,pos,"I love the MDX however have had one 
disconcerting observation. The paint 
seems to chip quite easily.I have now 
noticed a paint bubble on the hood. I 
have owned nearly every make of auto 
and am somewhat concerned about the 
integrity of the finish on this 
vehicle. Futhermore, I have noticed 
this on other MDXs in parking lots. I 
found a newer MDX with a 3-4 mm rusted 
rock chip on the hood in a parking 
lot. This seems odd. I would be 
interested in getting feedback from 
other owners."
acura,mdx,2002,shortyjw, 09/08/2003,Fix the Clicking,pos,"We bought this car after driving many 
and doing our research.  Love the car, 
but hate the clicking noise the brakes 
make every time you switch gears.  
We've had it in for service and called 
Acura's customer help line.  Everyone 
says this noise is normal.  It doesn't 
sound normal- especially for a car made 
by Acura that sells for almost 
$40,000.  Dissappointed that Acura 
doesn't seem to think this is a 
problem, nor are they trying to fix it."
acura,mdx,2002,MacGyver , 08/13/2003,LOVE MY MDX,pos,"I was in the market for a SUV and had read 
positive reviews on the MDX from leading
car magazines and it was name as a Best
Buy in Consumer Reports Magazine as
well.  It drives like a car build has
the room of an SUV and handles great in
the snow!  It also has comes very nicely
equipped for a a base model so much so I
didn't see the need to spend an extra
$2500.00 on the touring package!

  "
acura,mdx,2002,PCH, 12/03/2004,Still a winner,pos,"Car delivers as promised.  There's a reason why it continued to win editors choice awards after 3 years.  Interior design is good, could be a bit more luxurious.  Gas mileage excellent under 70 MPH (23.5 MPG highway on my last trip - awesome for a mid-sized suv!).  Minor build quality issues; back of drivers seat broke off, cup holder latch needed to be replaced.  Like that they used to be rare on the road"
acura,mdx,2002,ParkerMDX, 09/29/2003,"Good SUV, crunchy brakes",pos,"Overall, this is a great vehicle. I 
noticed when it had about 6,000 miles 
that when I would come to a stop 
(mostly after it sat idle for a bit) 
that the brakes make a ""crunching"" 
noise. I took it in for it's 7500 mile 
check and it passed. I recently took 
it back in for the 15K check and 
verbalized the same concern. They 
could find nothing wrong and said that 
even some of the sedans made the same 
noise and that was typical for Acura's.
There have been no safety issues, but 
that same noise continues."
acura,mdx,2002,Gerald, 01/28/2005,Fun Car,pos,Just bought pre-owned. Very pleased with ride and Engine response. Very comfortable and love the 3rd row seat. Navagation very easy to read. Gas mileage is good for a suv. Overall no complaints.
acura,mdx,2002,jsdtbd, 10/11/2003,Great Vehicle,pos,"I have read the most recent reviews 
(from Aug 2003 to present) and I agree, 
there is a 'clunking' sound with the 
brakes when changing gears. Concerned 
me at first but realized it 
was 'normal'.  However, something 
should be done about it in future 
models.I have had no problems with 
paint-thankfully!  We did purchase this 
vehicle based on Consumer Guide.  It 
has met all of our expectations.  It is 
pricey and you will pay full sticker 
for one.  But very enjoyable to drive."
acura,mdx,2002,Carol F, 10/14/2003,2002 Acura MDX Touring,pos,"Best car I've ever owned-a joy to 
drive.  Everything seems well thought 
out.  Stability was important to me, 
because my last SUV (not an Acura) was 
so unstable I nearly lost control of 
it on the freeway when I had to make a 
quick correction.  The MDX is steady 
as a rock.  After driving it for a 
year, I am as delighted with it now as 
when I bought it. It has been problem 
free.   "
acura,mdx,2002,Derbys, 03/30/2005,Love our MDX,pos,"We live up an unpaved drive on the side of a mountain.  The MDX handles it effortlessly in all kinds of conditions.  Extremely comfortable, fun to drive, wonderful Bose audio system.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Kmac, 10/15/2003,great choice,pos,"Nearly 2 years later and I still love 
it."
acura,mdx,2002,bphill, 05/31/2005,Everything I always wanted,pos,"This vehicle truly has the best of all worlds ex.style, comfort, luxury, performance, and fuel efficient.  Not to mention that the sound system is top notch (even has a sub).  My wife and I both are very pleased all around.  The next vehicle I buy will be a newer version of the MDX.  The only thing I wish I had in this one is the navigation option.  The next one I buy will have the navigation and dvd entertainment."
acura,mdx,2002,mikedhilljr, 12/15/2003,Mike's Acura MDX Review,pos,"We are very pleased to have purchased 
the 2002 Acura MDX.  The outstanding 
exterior styling is matched with 
outstanding performance.  Not the most 
powerful engine in the world, but more 
than sufficient for its purpose.  This 
vehicle is highly recommended."
acura,mdx,2002,dboe, 02/09/2004,Ready anytime!,pos,"This is a great utility vehicle, while 
having nice style, and good comfort. 
Acceleration is brisk, and handling is 
above average for any vehicle in it's 
class. It is very stable on the road, 
at speed and/or under windy conditions.
Space utilization is great. While it 
easy to load it up, the towing 
capacity is on the small side. 
Mileage is not bad for the weight of 
vehicle. 
Brakes are just adequate. They should 
be better, this is not an easy vehicle 
to snub down from speed quickly.
Interior materials are on the cheap 
side. But so far everything seems to 
be holding up just fine. "
acura,mdx,2002,cachupin25, 03/06/2003,Honda/Acura has come a long way!,pos,"In my opinion best SUV for the price if 
compared to many European, American, 
and other Asian SUVs.  Performance is 
great, has great trailering ability, 
all though, if at the limit of the 
trailering weight, the rear suspension 
lacks strength.  Maintenance is good if 
compared to any European vehicle.  
Honda/Acura has re-engineered all their 
vehicles to add a european flavor to 
them and has also strengthened the body 
strucutre if compared Honda/Acuras 
built in the 80s."
acura,mdx,2002,Kenny a., 05/22/2006,Still Happy,pos,"I still love my MDX. the car has 95,000 miles on it and I am torn between replacing it with another or waiting to the new model comes out. I did have a few problems (transmission replaced at 35,000 miles & need a new motor mount at 90,000). But I still love the car. Acura has been wonderful auto company to deal with. "
acura,mdx,2002,rroushdy, 04/19/2004,Excellent all around,pos,"Excellent handling, fun to drive, kids 
love it very comfortable and well 
disgnd interior."
acura,mdx,2002,nbg, 05/02/2004,Not first choice but LOVE it!,pos,"This was not the vehicle that I was 
going to buy but I decided to test the 
2002 Acura MDX Touring and ended up 
with one.I grow to love this car more 
each day.This preowned came with a DVD 
player which is a godsend when taking 
trips with our two kids. I car pool to 
two different schools as well and can 
comfortably carry 5 kids and backpacks 
with no problems (ages 10-13). All 
sports gear fits (we play hockey) as 
well.Mileage: 17 city/21.5 hwy NOTE: 
Complaint to dealer re: rear brake 
noise was met with add on trim kit for 
the rear brakes. Now no noise and 
covered under warranty. "
acura,mdx,2002,RichGilb, 05/03/2004,What an AWESOME SUV!,pos,"This is an AWESOME SUV. I HIGHLY 
recommend this vehicle. It sits high 
and has wonderful traction. The wide 
wheel base makes it feel like a 
panther over bumpy terrain. In fact, 
it is surprisingly spacious inside.

It is sure-footed on any type of road 
surface or weather condition. The all-
wheel drive is one of the most 
sophisticated in the industry. Try it 
and you'll see why.

The VTEC engine is an animal! Very 
smooth, and sufficiently powerful. 
Acura reliability and performance.

The Navigation system is one of the 
best on the market. The voice is 
excellent and pleasant, and it ties 
into the stereo system seemlessly."
acura,mdx,2002,RedMDX, 05/19/2004,Very Dissapointing for $40K!,neg,"For $40K this has been a dissapointment 
to say the least...even if it cost $30K 
we'd be dissapointed....it's spent way 
too much time in the shop and there are 
still many things that the dealership 
says are normal, but they sure are 
annoying. We've had to have the entire 
VTM (4 wheel drive system) 
replaced..now the tranny is being 
recalled! 2 other minor recalls as 
well. Tires are shot at 30K! gas 
mileage at 16/18 vs. window of 
18/23...and we are easy drivers. Used 
to get 16/18 out of full sized V-8 
Chevy Tahoe and on regular gas!!"
acura,mdx,2002,unc028, 07/12/2004,Great SUV!,pos,"If you want a fun to drive, lots of cargo room or 
people room, with the capability of 4WD suv, this is 
the suv. It has so much cargo room with the second 
row seats folded down, plus it has a 3rd row in the 
back to let to more people sit. All I can say it is the 
best suv I've ever had!"
acura,mdx,2002,Pdeaun, 08/02/2004,Gettin another one as soon as I can,pos,"This is a great SUV!  It's stylishness 
turns heads.  It's roomy, I have filled 
this truck with 2 32 inch TV's (in 
their boxes) and still had room for the 
rest of the Christmas shopping bags. 
The MDX is a real workhorse.  It has 
good pick-up and is not bad on gas 
(which is getting harder and harder to 
judge)  As soon as I am ready, I will 
fly back to the dealer for a newer model"
acura,mdx,2002,B. Tierney, 09/04/2004,Acura's Best,pos,"We love our MDX - so much so that we 
will never drive any other car.  We are 
completely sold on this car.  In almost 
three years we have had absolutely no 
problems with it.  The maintenance 
schedule is reasonable and we have been 
able to keep it up with limited cost.  
This car is a winner!!!!   "
acura,mdx,2002,tfit, 10/05/2004,stuck wt. transmission woes ???,pos,"We just purchased our mdx after having 3 
odysseys.The main objective was to move into a 
high quality, performance suv. Honda was always 
great to us when service was required on our vans. 
Now the problem....our mdx is having a 1500 rpm 
transmission shutter. it has 42000 miles. By doing 
proper research I know it will need a transmission. 
it has the same transmission probems as some 
hondas( that honda will cover to 100,000 miles).So 
far acura is doing warranty to 50,000 miles.Acura is 
playing games with customers and treating 
problems case by case , as not to tarnish the acura 
image by hidding its real problems from the public."
acura,mdx,2002,KYShredder, 04/23/2005,Worth the wait,pos,"I waited 5 months for delivery, and wasn't disappointed.  It is the perfect blend of sport, utility & luxury.  Pickup is quick, handling precise yet comfortable.  I've had 7 passengers in it for short treks without complaints.  Also, I've had 4x8 sheets of drywall in it - they lie flat! It's not so luxurious that you are scared to mess it up. The wife and I fight over driving it.  It isn't as luxurious as a Lexus.  Suggested improvements are 'nits'.  With the value and performance, cannot understand why anyone would waste money on any other SUV in this class. II'd buy another!"
acura,mdx,2002,Outlaw 06, 03/18/2003,Good vehicle but not a great vehicle.,pos,"My wife drives the MDX primarily for 
shopping and shuttling around our 3 
children.  I drive it primarily on 
weekends.  Like all Hondas, the MDX 
offers good reliability and value 
(dealer price gouging 
notwithstanding).  The MDX is built 
well and has a very good engine and 
drivetrain.  The MDX's interior quality 
and ergonomics are also very good.  
However, performance is average, 
handling is unimpressive and the 
vehicle is noisy at highway speeds.  
Braking is HORRIBLE, the MDX takes 
forever to stop!  Additionally, the MDX 
is not very stylish when compared to 
other ""luxury"" SUVs such as the BMW X5 
or Mercedes-Benz M-Class (regardless of 
the price difference)."
acura,mdx,2002,bccarguy90, 07/15/2006,2002 Acura MDX Love Affair,pos,"My 2002 Acura MDX has been a flawless partner in all that I have asked of it. Aside from damage caused by accidents, there have been no problems and power has proved more than adequate. It is extremely comfortable particularly on long hauls and can carry anything from garbage to people easily. This is my top pick in the lux SUV category."
acura,mdx,2002,rgaray, 08/29/2006,BEST CAR I HAVE OWNED,pos,"I just purchased a pre-owned 2002 MDX over a month ago and to say that i am satisfied with this vehicle would be a huge understatement. This SUV drives and handles like a sedan, has the cargo space of a minivan and the ruggedness of an suv. I did a lot of research and test drove a couple of vehicles before my purchase(ML 320 being one) and am happy i made my decision to purchase the MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,D. L. May, 09/08/2006,"Surprise, Surprise!!",pos,"Bought the vehicle used with approximately 57000 miles on it.  Bought the warranty and glad I did.  Transmission had a major failure at 73000 miles.  So disappointing as my warranty is covering most of the cost of repair to replace the transmission, but not all. I told the dealership I was surprised that a high end SUV would have a major drivetrain failure with just 73000 miles.  I can't justify ever purchasing a Honda/Acura after this experience.   Advice, don't buy this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2002,Rod, 01/11/2007,Great Used Car,pos,I bought a MDX touring with nav that had 92K miles and it is great.  This SUV drives and handles well. I'm getting about 20-21 miles a gallon from driving around town and 24-25 on road trips. Never got that from my GMC Envoy.  There were some small problems since the car is 4 years old like timing belts and brakes but overall this SUV is in excellent shape. I would recommend this SUV for anyone looking for a used vehicle.
acura,mdx,2002,Linda, 03/06/2002,Love it!,pos,It's easy to see why they are being sold as quickly as they arrive on the sales floor.
acura,mdx,2002,Not too Impressed, 04/10/2003,It has it's quirks,pos,"When I bought my MDX I thought I was 
getting quality that you would expect 
with the Acura name. I have never spent 
this much on a vehicle before and had 
high expectations. There are too many 
quirks for a $40k car. 

Rattling noises from every where, 
doors, rear seats, dashboard and some 
places that I just can't figure out.  
The driver seat back squeaks if pushed 
back on slightly. After a rain or car 
wash if you roll your window down the 
inside window gets wet and must be 
wiped off. Sometimes there is this low 
ringing noise that I can't figure out 
where it's coming from. Not to mention 
the annoying brake clicking and gas 
tank sloshing. "
acura,mdx,2002,Hench, 03/06/2002,Disappointed,pos,"Waited 6 months, had to bring back at 350 & 1500 mls for noisy front end. It appears it's inherent to the X. Wind noise, tail gate slight bend and e-brake doesn't hold without extreme pressure. I'm disappointed with the build quality. It wasn't worth the wait. Make sure to take a good test drive if you can. I do love the look, the interior layout and it does cruise very nice on the highway, but at $44K delivered, knowing what I know now, I don't think I would buy again with these problems."
acura,mdx,2002,oceansix, 03/07/2002,Really nice SUV,pos,"The best vehicle that I have ever owned.  Lots of cargo space.  Good fuel mileage and range considering how powerful the engine is. Great AWD system for driving on wet or icy asphalt roads.  Excellent turning radius.  I like the ride and I find the seats to be comfortable.  Can tow up to 4,500 pounds (boat) or 3,500 pounds if any other type of trailer towed, but requires the addition of transmission and power steering fluid coolers."
acura,mdx,2002,Burbanlover, 03/08/2002,Worth the wait!,pos,"As my ""alias"" implies I drive a Suburban, while I traded my wife's '98 Discovery in for the new MDX.  Although we waited for five months, the vehicle was worth it.  It's road mannerisms are more car-like than an SUV but can accommodate more than four people (15 total when adding the Suburban's capacity).  All joking aside, as a parent, I am increasingly discouraged by sedan manufactures turning rear seats into ""buckets"" reducing their effective capacity by one."
acura,mdx,2002,hdnordhaus, 05/18/2003,A great SUV,pos,"Ride and handling for an SUV is 
excellent, more like a sedan than SUV.
Seats, driver and passenger, are the 
most comfortable of all vehicles I 
have ever been in.  Fuel economy is 
remarkable (I get better than the 
claimed 23 MPG on the highway) 
considering the power is more than 
adequate. "
acura,mdx,2002,Caroline, 05/15/2003,Love my X,pos,"I have fallen in love with a car/ suv. 
So far I have driven through 3 
snowstorms with out any fear, and 
driven to Florida twice. And, if 
someone wants to go somewhere, I 
volunteer to drive them. Handles like a 
dream, has great pickup, there is a 
great feeling of safety and control. "
acura,mdx,2002,WeTwo, 11/27/2007,Very Happy,pos,"After five years we still love this car.  It has been totally reliable, handles well, has sufficient power for freeway driving and has a surprisingly tight turning radius for its size.  Last, but not least, this MDX has extremely comfortable seating in the front and second row  (we have never used the 3rd row). We would recommend it highly. We expect ours to be carrying us around for many years to come. "
acura,mdx,2002,ladylib, 11/13/2002,Liberty loves it!,pos,"The MDX was not without inital minor 
problems (the thud, the weeping mirrors)
but both problems were resolved by 
Acura and the dealership.

Hubby was recently in a 50mph freeway 
crash in our MDX, and while our vehicle 
is pronbably totalled, he wasn't. This 
vehicle has earned it's admirably high 
safety rating - it did what it was 
designed to do and I'm grateful. Those 
foks at Acura build an awewsome egg 
crate. We're not looking elsewhere - 
we're just planning on replacing our 
damaged MDX with a  newer model. 
Thanks Acura!"
acura,mdx,2002,americare, 05/25/2003,Love our MDX,pos,"The MDX is nearly everything we 
expected it to be.  It is very roomy, 
handles well and is comfortable to 
drive.  We did however, expect better 
than 18.8 mpg  considering the MDX 
requires premium gasoline. We would 
also like to have had a rear window 
that goes down. Otherwise it is a 
terrific vehicle and an excellent value!"
acura,mdx,2002,nrstycz, 06/03/2003,AcuraMDX,pos,"I live 100 miles from my nearest Acura 
dealer. As I had hoped, I have never 
had a need for service on my MDX 
except for oil, tire rotations, and 
wiper blades. My only significant 
complaint is the wind noise from 
interstate crosswinds are magnified by 
water channels on both sides of the 
windshield."
acura,mdx,2002,suvman87, 03/12/2002,Couldn't be happier,pos,"Drives like a sedan.  Its roomy and the rear seat folds flat for lots of storage space.  Excellent fuel economy so far, averaging about 20 mpg.  Outstanding navigation system.  Easy to use.  Also very good acceleration with the 240 hp engin."
acura,mdx,2002,caroline, 05/15/2003,Love my X,pos,"I have fallen in love with a car/ suv.

acura,mdx,2002,frodo, 03/14/2002,Gret Vehicle,pos,Fun vehicle...enjoying it greatly
acura,mdx,2002,mdxking, 03/14/2002,i want another,pos,"I can't belive i waited 5 months for the vehicle, but it was worth the wait.
The standered features are unbelivable.
I never thought i would use the navigation system, but it is a lifesaver
i don't have to get out and ask for directions.(male thing) After my brother saw my vehicle he went and ordered one to. he only has to wait 3 months.(no fair) Life goes on."
acura,mdx,2002,sdf97215, 07/08/2003,Love this MDX,pos,"I have been looking for a replacement 
vehicle for my 95 Subaru Legacy for 2 
years.  Nothing turned me on til I 
tried out the Acura MDX.  It was 
comfortable for me right off the bat.  
I ended up purchasing a 8 month old 
MDX instead of a new one.  It has the 
Navigation system which is neat but 
not a requirment.  

This vehicle is a great car but does 
lack some of the luxury refinements 
that you would find in upscale 
vehicles such as the Lexus, BMW, etc.  "
acura,mdx,2002,dade, 03/17/2002,great car,pos,this car is the bbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssstttttttt
acura,mdx,2002,mdxmd, 03/17/2002,Best luxury SUV available!,pos,"Drives like a car, but like most other SUVs, it's a bit underpowered for the amount of weight it has to haul around."
acura,mdx,2002,Tiger Lady, 03/18/2002,Total Package!,pos,"My MDX is everything I had expected!  During the business week, it's perfect for taking colleagues and clients to lunch.  On the weekends, it's perfect for hauling my two large labrador retrievers, golf clubs and bicycle!  The MDX is definitely a total package."
acura,mdx,2002,thollerb, 03/24/2002,The best SUV,pos,"I never thought I would love driving a sport ute.  Fun to drive, 20 mpg gas milage, the best value for the money. If you are considering a sport ute, don't look past this one."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXOwner, 03/24/2002,Excellent SUV,pos,"Great SUV w/ loads of room, great horsepower, and tons of options!  Couldn't ask for a better SUV!"

acura,mdx,2002,J Nystrom, 03/25/2002,My Acura MDX Road Trip,pos,"Just returned from a trip to California in my new '02 MDX. Car handled extremely well, passed most other cars going over 10,000 ft Colorado passes. Extremely comfortable front and middle, a little cramped in third row. At 75 MPH, still has a lot of additional passing power, and is very solid on snow/ice. Very good visibility all around and roomy with third row seats folded down. Gas mileage on trip ranged from around 18 to 22 MPH. Extremely happy with this car."
acura,mdx,2002,WeWantMoreMPG, 03/26/2002,"Happy, but...",pos,"Overall, we're happy with the vehicle.  Our only complaint is we're averaging 16 MPG.  Its rated 17-23....Where's the love?  
Anyone else having this problem?"
acura,mdx,2002,daniel, 03/28/2002,Great,pos,Great vehicle
acura,mdx,2002,mjm, 03/28/2002,great SUV,pos,this drives like a car and has great storage space. I love the 50/50 3rd row sheet my son rides back ther and I still have room to carry stuff.
acura,mdx,2002,Wicky, 04/23/2008,Like My Acura,pos,"We just got our Acura and love it a lot. It's quick, roomy & luxurious.  The sound system is great and we really like the memory seats.   Bottom line is that this vehicle has outstanding standard options. The only additional feature I wish ours had is the ""navi.""    We've only had it about a month but thus far it rates right up there in the top 3 vehicles I've owned.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Carolina, 01/14/2017,My Favorite Vehicle,pos,"The MDX has been my favorite vehicle so far of all the Honda's I've owned. It's been realize and has met my family for over 10 years. I've barely now begun to think about updating because of the age.
"
acura,mdx,2003,andy3631, 03/23/2013,I love my MDX,pos,"I have had my Acura for about 7 years now and I absolutely love it. I bought it with 70,000 miles on it and I currently have 209,000 miles. I have never had any major problems
with it. I actually drove about 2000 miles from Chicago to California and it drove great. I hope to have it for another 200,000 miles. "
acura,mdx,2003,mvegastar, 02/22/2012,Thinking of an '03 Acura MDX? Run Away!!!!!!,neg,"My husband and I have owned a lot of different makes and models in our time, but we have had the WORST experience with our '03 Acura MDX.
We are the 2nd owner of the car, clean carfax report, bought it with 48K miles.
Owing it less than 4 yrs, not including regular maint such as oil changes, brakes and tires, we have spent over $15k on repairs!
Two transmissions, a motor, a paint job and breaking down on vacations twice to name some if it!
This car has been a nightmare and Acura could care less since we bought it used.
When reading other reviews, the transmission is clearly a problem, but has there been a recall? Nope.
I hope sharing our experience will help others avoid the same pain "
acura,mdx,2003,rquigley1, 01/15/2012,Keeps on going,pos,I was the 2nd owner. Bought in 4 years ago with 100k on the odometer. Super reliable. Changed timing belt at 140k and follow the service recommendations. I do all my own work from fluids to plugs etc. Read some posts about a tranny shift problem and noticed a little hesitation around 170k. I did a triple flush of the AT fluid and care is running just fine. I expect to get it to 200k and then buy the current body style acura. Only real problem is a hum in the stereo and loud whine in the rear dvd system after about an hour of operation. For the money- a super car. 
acura,mdx,2003,tom, 09/18/2009,Documented transmission problems,neg,"With problem after problem for my 03 MDX I thought I heard it all when local acura dealer informed me that one out of four 01-03 mdx's will need the transmission replaced!  This from a so called luxury car?  Check the web and you'll see it's true.  Don't buy this year range, cause you'll have a 25% chance of failure."
acura,mdx,2003,extremus669, 10/22/2009,"110,000 miles and still going strong",pos,"I bought my MDX in 2005 with ~62K miles on it.  It was a certified pre-owned vehicle.  I've put almost 50K additional miles on it since and the past four years have been trouble-free. Maintenance includes the occasional fluid changes (oil, VTM, transmission fluids, etc.).  The timing belt was also replaced at ~107K per the maintenance schedule.  Rides and handles great for a vehicle its size (and age)."
acura,mdx,2003,george ganem, 09/14/2006,Better than my 3 grand cherokees,pos,"I have always been pleased with owning this vehicle compared to my previous three grand cherokees. There seems to be less driver compartment room than the jeeps, but the ride is much smoother and quieter. Gas economy is better in the acura. Always felt the acura is a step up from most other suvs. Being 6'4"" tall, many other suv models are more crowded in the drivers area.  "
acura,mdx,2003,Stacy, 04/12/2018,Transmission Trouble Twice,pos,"We had a transmission rebuilt and a month after the warranty, it went out again. Mechanics say-stay away from 2003s. Other than that VERY costly repair, its a fantastic SUV.
"
acura,mdx,2003,klaire funderburgh, 09/10/2018,best car yet,pos,"bought this car with 182xxx and i’ve put 6,000 so far. owned it around 4 months and has 0 problems. drives and rides so much better than any other car we’ve had, chevy, jeep, honda and ford. i LOVE the inside and out, both are very nice looking and stay clean fairly easily. i’m a nanny and have car seats in and out of car all the time...LATCH system makes it easy to install and remove and leaves plenty of space for kiddos. nice sized suv. i live at 9000ft in conifer colorado and it does just fine on all out twisty roads even with power steering issues. seems to have descent traction on ivey roads. overall i’m in awe at acura, they really did a nice job with this one
"
acura,mdx,2003,logun, 05/18/2012,2 yr 3 month ownership (happy),pos,"Bought this SUV for my wife in late 2009 early 2010, with 74,500 miles on it.
We've put 23,000 miles on it (+ or -). We've had it dealer maintained as it was from the previous owner (we r 2nd owner). We've made sure to maintain the transmission (both frnt & rear diffs as well) as AWD or 4 x 4 vehicles require this otherwise it breaks. We have replaced shocks, struts, motor mounts, window regulator & a tensioner set.
The pwr steering does quit when we hit a large puddle till the belt dries (within a few sec.) Otherwise it's been a great vehicle. She even runs low to mid grade octane gas without issue."
acura,mdx,2003,Jon Kvernmo, 11/10/2016,Best car ever,pos,"Acura has it together.  All things considered, we would not hesitate to buy another MDX or any other Acura that fits our current needs and use parameters.
"
acura,mdx,2003,JB, 12/25/2015,TRANSMISSION,pos,"I bought this car with 43,000 miles on it in Nov 2006. Car was fantastic. When I bought the car I went for the 12 month extended warranty for an extra $1200. About 11 months into owning the car I got a check engine light and flashing D5 light. Took it to the Acura dealer. Trans DEAD!!! They replaced it for free since it was under warranty and gave me a loaner while they did it. So then about 2 years ago I notice the trans slamming into gear. Changed fluid....same crap. So October 2014 D4 blinking light and check engine light AGAIN!!! Car would not switch out 4th gear. I took it to a trans place and had the trans totally rebuilt new Valve body, PC, gears and synchros. The builder took pics of the trans it was HORRIBLE all burned up and stuff. So what Honda does is place the trans cooler into the Rad so I have no idea how but the cooling fluid got into the trans fluid probably because trans cooler in the rad and ruined the trans. So the builder added an EXTERNAL trans cooler. So now just a few days ago.....D5 blinking light. But no check engine light and car drives fine. I took the car back to the builder and he said there were no trans codes in the history or anything. I'm so done with this car. I am VERY VERY disappointed in Honda. All the Honda 5sp Autos are pure garbage and they should be ashamed of themselves. Other than the 2 trans I had to replace the car is awesome. But that trans ruins it! I cant believe Honda acting like they have no idea why this is happening. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR!!!! STAY AWAY!!! But an MDX with the new 6spd auto.
"
acura,mdx,2003,justman, 09/15/2011,Great Ride Except for Transmission,pos,"I love my MDX, but now have to to trade it in and don't want to or have $5,000 for a new one.
These SUVs are known to have transmission problems, wish I would have known that before I spent so much on it.
But, I will say, I bought mines brand new and have had it for 8 years with now major issues.
Just normally wear and tear.
Would love to get another one, but Acura still has issues with the tranny.
So, I think I'm going to go green and get a KIA Sorento.
Better gas mileage and it doesn't cost so much."
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 01/15/2010,"Love it for 160,000 miles!!!",pos,"My MDX has been great!  I have 160,000 miles and have only had to keep on maintenance schedule (although these can get a bit pricey).  I would get this car again and am actually thinking of purchasing a new MDX or RDX.  Only negative is that after 150K miles started to get a number of interior rattles - much to be expected after so much use. Speakers are excellent."
acura,mdx,2003,bmwguy, 03/03/2007,Disguised minivan,pos,"Bought a 1 year old used MDX with 14000k, drove about another 45k over 2.5 years. Roomy, mostly reliable, but NOT sporty. Closest to a minivan in ride and handling. Neither tough enough for offroad nor secure enough for sporty driving. Replaced starter under warranty, but scheduled dealer service pricey with frequent transfer case oil changes. Did I mention my dealer maintained creampuff did not hold value for a trade at an Acura dealer? Don't let Acura tell you this a a luxury car, just because it has leather seats. Mediocre stereo."
acura,mdx,2003,Dave, 03/20/2019,Best MDX ever,pos,"Too bad the newer models of the MDX are not equal to this one.  It has a few miles on it but it has held up beautifully.  Keeping it clean makes it always look new.  Performance is still great.  It is just old.  Every year we say it is time to get a new one, but the newer ones just don't compare.
"
acura,mdx,2003,renman, 12/11/2009,Cheap (really!) components,pos,"This is a great looking car IMHO.  And I love driving it, It's got a ton of room and handles nicely.  But... the quality of the internal parts... is just ridiculous.  Cheap, cheap, cheap. Vents, seat heaters, switches, etc, etc.  Parts that should last 5-6 years or longer (cuz they are just not used much) go out after 2-3 years.  A slightly better component would cost pennies, add maybe 1/2% to the total price of the car to upgrade all the little things to be reliable.  Going to think long and hard before I buy another Acura.  It's sad, because other than ALL the little things breaking, it's a great vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2003,acura 2003 mdx, 07/09/2009,Great SUV at first,pos,"Bought in March of 2003 new.  Since I bought the vehicle, I had nagging problems and at 82,000 miles I am starting to get a little worried.  I've had to replace the starter, ac compressor, vent knobs, cd player, drivers seat heater, hood struts, rear blower.  I expected more out of an Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,axelman001, 12/28/2009,2003 mdz Tranny Problems,pos,"We love the vehicle when we can keep it on the road. Bought CPO but we keep having tranny problems. Third Transmission in two years. Had same problem with our Odyssey, told problem was fixed by Honda by 2003. Wrong. Rest of car is great."
acura,mdx,2003,Post Captain, 02/16/2010,Buyer Beware,pos,"Bought this car brand new and have always maintained it properly, including the replacement of the timing belt at 105K.  Since that time it has been a money guzzling machine.  Left rear mirror fell out with motor assembly to the tune of $329.  Driver's side seat moulding broken along with loose driver's seat.  Now I've been told that the power steering is shot, a motor mount is broke, the seal around the left headlight needs to be replaced, among other things.  Total anticipated cost $3-5,000.  For all Acura says about quality, I don't know that I will buy another one."
acura,mdx,2003,stacey, 09/01/2005,disappointed,pos,"We purchased this car based on reviews of reliability and safety. Additionally, the third row seat was enticing. We have had several problems, the most serious being the brakes freezing up while driving due to a faulty sensor in the steering wheel telling the car that it was flipping and needing to stabilize! And we were 600 miles from home. Very scary and put my family at risk.  The back seat is only suitable for children. The car is noisy at high speeds.  And we get much lower gas mileage than Acura claims.  "
acura,mdx,2003,JimDee, 12/18/2005,Very satisfied,pos,"Has been an excellent vehicle. No problems in three years. Excellent highway vehicle. Mileage 22 to 24 mpg. City 16 mpg. Some road noise. Excellent service by two dealers, one in Ga and one in FL."
acura,mdx,2003,dorene1, 12/31/2002,what a great crossover vehicle!,pos,"We are so pleased with this vehicle! The acceleration is great, it's extremely quiet, and the road ride is soooo smooth. The turn radius is huge, and handling is precise. The split 3rd row gives us great flexibility of use, and we can get groceries and 3 kids in comfortably.  The DVD system is excellent, and tech features are all very useful. Solid choice for a family car."
acura,mdx,2003,gardner3, 05/22/2011,Great car!,pos,"This car overall is great! It's roomy, comfortable, smooth to drive, has power and looks good.

The sound system is nice, heated seats work well, seats fold, and I generally had no problems in long drives."
acura,mdx,2003,AGBew, 10/22/2003,MDX 2003,pos,"Best thing is the handling and when I 
first encounter rain the windsheild 
wipes went on automatically...blew me 
away. What a comfortable SUV...much 
better than my previous Durango. My 
daughter loves the DVD."
acura,mdx,2003,Skip, 04/18/2006,MDX review,pos,"Always either a Jeep or Jimmy for years.  Along with them had problems with the brakes on the Jeep's and wheel bareings on the Jimmy.  All I can say about my X is...it is nice to know, if I do not want to purchase a new auto the rest of my life, I won't have to....thank you"
acura,mdx,2003,msghana, 02/08/2007,"Smooth, reliable and luxurious",pos,This car handles beautifully. You can feel the horsepower as you adjust quickly to high speeds and it is so comfortable. This is my most favorite vehicle purchase ever!
acura,mdx,2003,posted1, 11/25/2007,Great SUV,pos,"Great vehicle. It does everything very, very well while doing almost nothing flashy. If this sounds like you, this is your SUV.  Safety is top-notch.  GPS is excellent safety / convenience feature.  Rear entertainment option is beyond value if you have kids.  Rear backup camera is now a requirement on any future vehicle after experiencing it in this MDX. This is a must.  We test-drove all competitors multiple times and this car won, hands down, in almost every measurable regard. The Lexus RX was quite nice but did not offer the convenience and functionality of this vehicle. BMW was OK at best. Infiniti was ""so-what?"". Great vehicle with minor opportunities for improvement."
acura,mdx,2003,PokerFaceJess, 09/10/2019,Powerful get up and go,pos,"There are some sensors that need to be replaced and it could use a good tune up, but this car is amazing from the power under the hood to the Bose speakers. 
"
acura,mdx,2003,bradywillin, 12/09/2019,Great but the MPG,pos,"The projected MPG is a complete lie. Driving mostly city, you'll be lucky to get 13 MPG, and around 20 highway. The luxury features have all held up; automatic windshield wipers, automatic climate control, heated seats, etc... The interior is a very comfortable place to be. You're isolated from almost all outside noise, to the point I often don't notice emergency vehicles until I see them in my mirrors. Very spacious, room for cargo even with seven passengers. Also for weighing 2.4 tons, it defiantly moves, with no struggle cruising at 100mph on the highway.
"
acura,mdx,2003,royalpar1, 09/01/2006,Wonderful SUV,pos,"I have this car now going on 4 years, no issues, the car is just great and probably the best SUV for the money. I have looked at others and believe that this the best value for money."
acura,mdx,2003,texan100, 06/16/2011,Would buy it again if not for transmission issues,pos,"I got CPO MDX after lot of research and consumerReports guide which rated MDX as the BEST suv. 

I did drive for 5 years and was very happy with my car.

I never had major issues and never paid any money from my pocket as it was all under warranty.
They did find problem with engine mounts, battery and some tubes that needed cleaning which was all taken care by Acura warranty.
I did regular maintenance. Dealer did charge me 600 or so for 60k mile service.
 Last year I did find that car was not going smooth. It was driving rough sometimes and smooth other times.
I also read about transmission issues when it hits 100k.
Since mine hit 92k I sold it."
acura,mdx,2003,RL, 04/29/2010,Transmission Problems,neg,Bought the vehicle certified and thank god I did. Three transmissions later and numerous minor fixes. Dont buy any MDX earlier than 2006 or you will be at the dealership often.
acura,mdx,2003,Jamo, 06/24/2003,Quality,pos,"Bought MDX over Highlander (second 
seats like a board) and Pilot (too much 
road noise); worth the additional 
cost.  Inside decor is excellent as is 
sound quality on Touring pkg system.  
Nav-didn't really want but now think 
it's great.  Crash ratings, stability 
system, front & side airbags, plus a 
solid, relatively quiet atmosphere give 
sense of security."
acura,mdx,2003,lilbull, 03/04/2003,Acura MDX Touring w/Entertainment,pos,"Excellent SUV for the money. Many 
things come standard. There are only a 
few options. It drives like a powerful 
car as opposed to a truck. Very 
comfortable."
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 05/06/2009,Transmission problems,pos,"I gave a poor reliability rating due to the fact that my transmission went out with only 73,000 mile on it. I can't believe that a SUV of this caliber would have this issue. Warranty ran out at 60,000 miles. Repair cost is $3,167.00. This is a regular problem with 2001 ,2002 and 2003 transmissions. "
acura,mdx,2003,Nanci, 05/23/2003,Best SUV On The Road,pos,"When I did my test drive I was so 
impressed in the way this SUV handled 
like a luxury car.  Everything a 
vehicle should have is included as 
standard.  The drive is smooth and 
quiet, the interior is comfortable and 
roomy.  Gas mileage is so-so.  Have not 
had it on the open road, all driving is 
freeway traffic and in town stop and 
go.  This vehicle is the best value for 
your money. You couldn't ask for more 
in an SUV no one can believe that cost 
of this luxury SUV"
acura,mdx,2003,Anny B, 03/08/2020,Pretty Lil Thing BUT....,pos,"I absolutely love my 03 MDX. I bought it used and the interior was immaculate and the exterior was also. It still looks brand new. But what I didn't do was research this year model. Seems that the transmissions tend to go out in them. I started having shifting problems so I looked it up and that's when I learned about the bad transmissions.  Took mine to a great tranny guy who is as honest as can be cause he could have easily said it was the transmission but he didn't.  He found a wire that had been chewed into and replaced it. Total out of my pocket, $75.00.
Every now n then it acts like it's in neutral when you give it gas but not often. Now it has motor problems. I was told several causes so I started with the most likely,  catalytic converter.  Bought brand new and replaced. Didn't fix it.  It smokes, uses oil and gas now which is something it never did before.  Nothing happened that I know of to have caused this and a compression check is on the agenda. 
To sum it up, even tho I love this vehicle, it has been a headache almost from day one. It only had about 190xxx miles on it when I bought it and when it's good it's great but that's been few and far between. Research the vehicle you're looking at, trust me, it will save you money and a headache.
"
acura,mdx,2003,Mary, 11/01/2020,Best car ever!,pos,"I loved this car, great drive, comfy and very reliable, an Acura tradition. Bpight ia 5 yrs old and 65K mi, sold it at 145K and 16 yrs old. Still in excellent condition with one exception- the transmission was going. This was unknown when I purchased it. Considered having it rebuilt, however, wanted a smaller SUV.  I have been testing BMW X3 and Acura RDX. The RDX is more reliable, the BMW lots of fun to drive. It all comes down to $$, so the RDX will be my choice. Looking for a 2011,  2012 model with low miles."
acura,mdx,2003,KauaiMDX, 07/28/2003,Blue Beauty,pos,"I really like this vehicle alot. There 
have been a few annoyances - the 
largest with the service department I 
have visited twice. This SUV is very 
comfortable to drive, has great 
heating and AC. It handles very well 
for a SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,alabama, 05/11/2003,Acura Owner in Alabama,pos,Love this vehicle.
acura,mdx,2003,GitaS, 06/17/2008,The problems are starting,pos,"Bought my MDX brand new 4 years ago. Has the most amazing and easy to use navigation system. Reliable drive. Has every feature you could need. Have had some problems though. From the start, I have had problems with starting my car (I live in sunny So. Cal). Battery has been changed twice but still doesn't always fire on the first or even second try. Now as I near 100,000 miles, things are beginning to fall apart. All the features on my steering wheel don't work (including airbag, horn, volume control, cruise cntrl). Passenger seat warmer is kaput. Vent control plastic knob fell off. SVA (or something) sensor failed. The repairs are now getting expensive. Was hoping to drive this for another 100K."
acura,mdx,2003,Maria Santos, 11/07/2002,acura suv fun to drive,pos,"this is one of the best svus I ever 
drove"
acura,mdx,2003,ECT, 11/28/2002,Fun to Drive,pos,"Great handling vehicle. It's amazing 
that the 20hp increase from the 2002 
model to the 2003 model gives so much 
more acceleration power. Workmanship 
quality is superb- not even a minor 
defect found in first 10 days."
acura,mdx,2003,dbehrens, 12/16/2002,Best vehicle ever owned,pos,"Ride and acceleration are excellent.  
The seat and driving position are very 
good.  We waited a long time and a lot 
of searching to find this vehicle.  
Nothing with seating for 7 handled or 
looked as nice as my MDX.  We are also 
thrilled with the Midnight Blue Pearl 
Exterior and Saddle enterior."
acura,mdx,2003,Franziska, 01/21/2003,First 30 days...,pos,"I have drivent the acura mdx for over 
30 days now and find it to provide me 
with a safety feeling... I am 
discouraged
with the gas mileage I have only 
averaged 16 in the city and 20 on 
highway."
acura,mdx,2003,choy, 07/14/2003,My MDX,pos,"A very confortable SUV. Lond driving 
friendly to passenger and driver."
acura,mdx,2003,cwilson336, 07/24/2003,Very Impressive,pos,"I've owned the car now for just a 
little over a week, and I still can't 
wait to drive it.  The ride is 
extremely smooth, the controls are 
right where they should be, and the 
performance is a knockout.  

I test drove the Lexus RX 330 and loved 
it, but I just couldn't pass up the 
value in a simarly equipped MDX.  My 
only request would be a better use of 
dash space.  The trip computer seems to 
be kind of silly and overkill.  "
acura,mdx,2003,mdxlover, 07/29/2003,mdx is the best suv on the planet!!!11,pos,"this is the best allround suv ever 
produced, it has refinement, comfort, 
luxury, power, a great sound system, 
four wheel drive system, and is great 
in almost every category imaginable."
acura,mdx,2003,Coolguy, 02/27/2003,The Underdog,pos,Great Car/SUV
acura,mdx,2003,matthewjoshua, 08/19/2003,A+,pos,"The MDX is excellent and fun to drive --
- very roomy and lots of cargo space.  
It is quiet and surely drives like a 
car.  Has lots of power and real easy 
to drive.  It is also fuel economy.  I 
love it's 2003 overall look.  I am so 
glad that I bought the MDX.  It's worth 
the money.  Thank you."
acura,mdx,2003,Freder Scott Bassett, 09/06/2003,MDX,pos,"Very satisfactory--thke first car in 
years that I have really been satisfied 
with (except for my 2002 Jaguar S Type)."
acura,mdx,2003,ccross4872, 09/14/2003,I Love my MDX!,pos,"This is the ultimate family car! It is 
fun for me and it is a huge hit with 
kids! There are so many standard 
features that are wonderful. It is an 
SUV that has an unbelievable smooth 
ride. It is pure luxury! "
acura,mdx,2003,TGrover, 09/19/2003,Very satisfying,pos,"Truly an all around pleasurable 
vehicle.  It works well as an executive 
commuter, but surprisingly, comfortably 
holds six more people for family 
outings.  Give it a curvey road and you 
can have a very good time, and not be 
punished by a stiff truck-like 
suspension.  But when the roads get 
slippery, the grip is very confidence 
inspiring.  Truly the best all around, 
good at everything vehicle I have ever 
driven."
acura,mdx,2003,Kevin G., 09/26/2003,Great SUV,pos,"Great SUV - would purchase again.  Some 
minor initial items were fixed by the dealer, no 
problem.  Roomy, confortable, decent styling 
- I think the reviewers who pan the styling are 
a bit off since I've checked out all the 
competition in the same league.  

This is my third Honda vehicl (first Acura) and 
I'm a devoted fan.  All  you need to do is put 
gas and regular maintenance and it will go 
forever.  Great resale value as well.  

Love it, love it, love it !!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,A. B. Garcia, 09/29/2005,Low Profile But Reliable,pos,"I've only had my Acura MDX for a month but I have enjoyed driving it.  When I was first looking for a vehicle, my choice was a certified 2004 Lexus RX 330.  My son, however, encouraged me to look at an Acura MDX.  Thus, I first test drove the Lexus, but somehow knew what to expect because I have a 1995 ES 300.  I, then humored my son and test drove an Acura.  Well, you guess what my choice was.  The Acura won hands down.   The exterior of the Acura will not catch your attention right away.  It has that low profile image.  But underneath that is the build quality, excellent appointments of the instruments on the dashboard,and of course, its reliability."
acura,mdx,2003,R. Lyman, 03/06/2003,A Winner,pos,"Works well.  Only problem is the window 
squirter has frozen up twice in one 
month:  once on the driver's side, once 
on the passenger's side.

Getting about 16 MPG around town, so 
the mileage is lower than advertised.  
Great in snow.  Like the bun warmers!"
acura,mdx,2003,Chris D, 05/11/2006,So disapponited in my MDX and Quality,neg,I bought my 2003 Acura MDX Brand new and currently it has 40k miles and in that time I have the Rotors and Brakes replaced under warr at least 4 times and all miles are highway and pampered. I have also had the truck at Acura on 4 ocassions for the Steering Wheel control because everytime I raise the volume the station changes and everytime the dealer says it was a bad ground and still can't fix it. I have opened up a complaint with Acura Corporate and bringing my truck again tonight to be fixed. All I can tell you is that I have 8 months left of my lease and I WILL NOT buy another Acura again it has been a big disappointment to spend $40000 on an SUV and deal with these constant problems
acura,mdx,2003,cheapflyfishingsob, 04/11/2003,Great Car!,pos,"Looked at the Landcruiser, GX470 and 
Sequoia.  I liked the GX because it was 
very luxurious and more of an SUV/off-
road feel, but it really had nothing on 
the MDX.  This drivetrain is awesome - 
Really quiet and effortless.  I love 
all the features and the practicality.  
The only thing the $50K cars have on 
this are wooden steering wheels and air 
shocks."
acura,mdx,2003,psaracco, 06/06/2003,MDX Rules,pos,"Very comfortable and smooth ride with a 
lot of power.  All amenities at your 
figertips."
acura,mdx,2003,ALTOBELLI, 06/18/2003,Nick,pos,"If you think a Honda product was 
soilid the Acura MDX is even better. 
It feels as if you are driving a car 
not an suv. It is just the right size, 
not like the yacht sized suv's nor 
like the micro suv's. The ride hight 
is perfect, my wife has no problem 
getting in and out."
acura,mdx,2003,gwen, 06/04/2008,Piece of junk falling apart,neg,"I bought a 2003 MDX a few months ago, a mistake. It had only a little over 60000 miles and is very poorly built. The transmission has problems. The headliner was cut too short and is falling out in the back. The rear window washer is about to fall off. And the right door has a part loose inside that makes a lot of noise when you close it. I would not buy another Acura. This company used to turn out good cars. What happened?"
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 06/27/2008,Just an excellent vehicle!!!!,pos,"This has been a great vehicle, never had any issues with normal maintenance in 65000 miles. "
acura,mdx,2003,Keith, 08/16/2008,"80,000 Miles and Still a Great SUV",pos,"Bought it new in July 2003 for a young family of 5. Road trips, in town, on the beach, in the mountains, deep snow, icy roads, high elevations. It has performed great through all of it.  Drove it on NC's beaches on the outer banks and went right past Toyotas stuck in the sand. We now live at 8600' elev. in the Rockies and drive up and down 3000' of elevation change daily, often on unplowed roads.  This car is perfectly balanced and always stays in control.  We have had no mechanical problems.  Only issue has been the seat heater, which quit working a year ago (and very expensive to repair).  If I had to do it over again, I definitely would!"
acura,mdx,2003,Happy Family Man, 08/23/2008,All purpose family vehicle,pos,"I purchased my MDX used with 64000 miles after I got my wife and father-in-law to leave the Lexus RX300. The ride is very sporty and comfortable. The roominess paid off immediately on a family trip. The navigation screen is big and simple to use, with voice activation, and the rear entertainment system kept the kids quiet and entertained on the whole trip from Texas to South Carolina. The vehicle ran perfect with no problems, just regular oil changes and services. I feel very comfortable putting my wife and kids in this vehicle anytime. The bland exterior should not distract you from the safety and comfort and style you get for the same luxury as Lexus without the 15000 price increase. "
acura,mdx,2003,techvet, 10/03/2008,Consistent failures,neg,I purchased this MDX certified pre owned last year with 30K miles on it and have had nothing but problems with it.  I have been to the dealer 6 times in the last 12 months with various engine lights/codes and what I call the Christmas tree - all error lights go off on the dashboard.  Sometimes is fixed with loosening the gas cap but most the time has to go to the shop.  The dealer will not honor the pre owned warranty so now I am paying for repairs every few months.  I bought for brand and this was not a good idea.
acura,mdx,2003,Ivan, 01/23/2009,"Great car, poor fuel efficiency but ...",pos,"All in all, a great car. I am happy with my purchase. There's a 3rd row of seats which neatly folds down invisibly which is why I bought it.  There are a lot of automatic extras like auto headlights and wipers and rear-view mirrors that dip when reversing that make owning this car a real joy.  The MDX is also deceptively spacious and sits tall however handles well. Performance is not an issue either but fuel economy kind of is. At an average 13 MPG in the city, you'd think you were driving a GM.  Aside from fuel efficiency (or lack thereof), this is a great family vehicle that looks great even sans-family. The 3rd row is invisible when not in use and it's a Honda so you know it's reliable."
acura,mdx,2003,muymajo99, 05/02/2009,Love this car!,pos,"Purchased this car used in 2006 and have had an excellent experience.  I had had an Acura Legend earlier and had absolutely no problems.  I need to say that this car has been a dream.  I am looking forward to keeping it at least two more years.  Currently I have 84,000 miles and still love it."
acura,mdx,2003,Jon, 08/02/2009,"Good vehicle, but little problems add up",pos,"Bought used with 30K miles - all was fine for 2.5 years. Now, with only 65K miles we have had a lot of minor issues...All A/C vents have fallen off; seat molding on drivers side fell off, rain sensor doesn't work, DVD player stopped working.  Like I said, relatively minor, but very frustrating.  For a supposedly reliable, well built vehicle I'd expect more.  We only drive this about 10K miles per year and don't abuse it.  Overall, a good vehicle, reliable and roomy enough for 2 kids in car seats.  "
acura,mdx,2003,CalJuls, 09/05/2009,"Nice ride, poor quality components",pos,"Purchased our MDX with 41K on it and performance was good for about a year. The room inside is great except the third row - tight fit - the ride is nice. Serious quality issues with interior components and auto seats. Driver regulator bolt snapped in half -  cost to repl 1,500 - the finger controls for air vents snapped off - 275.00 ea to repl the vent modules - can't just repl the finger control pieces that snap off. I went to Acura based on their reputation and being a past loyal Honda driver - I am disappointed -  hv 97K miles now and getting 18 mpg - all sched main service has been followed. Being told to consider trade in by my dealer 'cause my next regular sched main will be costly - 2K."
acura,mdx,2003,Bruce, 09/12/2009,This is a great vehicle,pos,"I have owned my MDX for almost 2 years and have not had any problems. I drove it from Ohio to California and averaged 23 MPG. The seats are comfortable, the navigation system superb and the storage area large. It goes great in the Ohio winters too."
acura,mdx,2003,Max, 11/21/2009,Good SUV design; Possibly a bad year,pos,"At around 75000, my transmission went out and I've pampered this car since purchase. Luckily still under warranty at the time. Acura says this is highly unusual, though judging from other comments here not exactly so. Have had to replace air vent controls as they keep popping off. I asked Acura as often as this was happening, was this a manufacturer/material's defect or just a poor design (2-piece clip-on). I suspect both. I would expect more from Acura particularly in parts design. All in all a great SUV in general. MPG is about average for SUVs."
acura,mdx,2003,Mom Driver, 05/29/2010,Wish it would last forever!,pos,"Love my MDX and have had no major problems. My brake pads have been replaced several times, common for heavy SUVs. Vent knob spontaneously broke when I touched it a few months ago--sounds like this happens often with MDXs. Plastic trim on driver's seat has come off--also common. So far drive train and transmission work fine, but at 65K, I wonder how long that will last. Don't like style of new MDX as much! Too flashy! Want to keep this one as long as possible."
acura,mdx,2003,Acuraguy, 10/16/2002,Acura MDX The Best SUV,pos,"I like the DVD System. The 260 HP

perfect. I really enjoy driving this 
suv."

will be suprised. Get the Acura MDX. 
You don't have to take my word for it, 
go test drive the MDX."

ultimate luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,Boston Guy, 10/23/2002,2003 MDX,pos,"Excellent engine, I think its the best 
in its class. The torque band is very 
wide for a VTEC small 3.5L engine. The 
ride is quite and the handling is 
sporty. I have test drove about 10 SUV 
before I brought this Acura. I pay 
little more than I would like but I am 
very satify."
acura,mdx,2003,NYDriver, 10/28/2002,A Portable Entertainment Center,pos,"I just picked up my new 2003 MDX and 
took it on a 7 hour drive.  The 
performance and handling was superb.  
It was quite comfortable, particularly 
the seats, which felt a bit narrow at 
first, but provided great support over 
the long trip.  The entertainment 
system is great, but I think that I 
will need to go back to college to 
figure out how to work the endless 
permutations (CD-front/DVD-Rear, DVD 
front/Rear, CD Changer-front/CD Rear, 
etc.)
The vehicle provides great visibility 
and you feel comfortable at any speed."
acura,mdx,2003,JoeMDX, 10/30/2002,Not So Great MDX,neg,"This SUV has been nothing more than a 
major disappointment.  Since purchasing 
the vehicle in Septemebr, the MDX has 
been back to the dealer four times for 
electrical problems, a battery problem 
and finally a brake problem.  The 
dealer has been supportive and 
understanding but this MDX is a waste 
of money.  We may have the one bad 
apple but this should never happen."

allot of 4 wheel driving and I just 
need something to haul stuff and drive 
well in the snow.  This SUV is

acura,mdx,2003,Richard Alexander, 10/23/2002,MDX: SUV You Can Really Count On,pos,"The MDX provides great handling with 
style. The seating is very comfortable 
and adjustable.  Driving the vehicle is 
effortless as it provides excellent 
stability on and off the pavement with 
good acceleration. Because it drives 
like a sedan, I was surprised to 
discover that it is a highly capable 
off-road vehicle. For me, the MDX 
provides a perfect balance of luxury 
features, comfort and the performance 
you'd expect from an SUV. When I let my 
friends drive the MDX, it can be 
difficult to get keys back. Even if you 
don't like the idea of driving an SUV, 
you will find that driving the MDX is 
the coolest. Price-wise, it is an 
amazing value."

accelaration."

can find for my needs.. I was prooven
wrong.. The 2003 MDX have much more of
cool stuff.."
acura,mdx,2003,MSH, 11/15/2002,Love this car..er..truck,pos,"Looked at several other SUV's before 
going to the Acura dealership.  Was 
leaning heavily towards the RX300 and 
Highlander.  Once we sat in the MDX and 
drove it though, we knew that it was 
the vehicle for us.  Great room.  Third 
seat is a nice benefit, even if it's 
never used.  The engine is amazing.  
Plenty of power when you need it.  And 
the ride is more car than truck like."
acura,mdx,2003,jmreiss, 11/28/2002,jmreissmdx,pos,"outstanding suv.  the voice activated 
navigation system with the rear backup 
camera is a must.
this is the best suv for any price"
acura,mdx,2003,mellowbo, 11/30/2002,2003 Acura MDX,pos,"Ordered the 2003 6 months ago and it 
was worth the wait.  Quiet, smooth and 
fun.  Just plain makes allot of sense!"
acura,mdx,2003,frankyy, 12/01/2002,2003 MDX Touring,pos,"I have researched at least 10 SUV 
models including RX300, ML 320, ML 
320, BMW X5 and Volvo XC 90). Acura 
MDX is the best one out there. Great 
value and Acura's high quality. 
Smoother than I expected."
acura,mdx,2003,Chnc, 12/05/2002,Disappointment,pos,"There is nothing really wrong with the 
Acura but there is nothing exciting 
about it either. Kinda cheap on the 
inside and outside and the vehicle 
isn't cheap. Bought one for my wife and 
it doesn't compare to the Volvo XC90 T6 
that I bought. Price was close between 
the two but the Volvo is much nicer 
both on the inside and outside and has 
so many more safety features. A boring 
car that gets the job done but doesn't 
excite in anyway."
acura,mdx,2003,acuraman12, 12/06/2002,Great all round SUV,pos,"Everything was great about this Vehicle.
It rides and drives like an Honda/Acura 
car product.

It has great power with the 260hp 
engine. There's no problem accelerating 
with four people inside.

Note that the last 2 seats are good for 
short trips and are for kids at best.

Just one nag. The interior driver door 
handle came with a defective molding 
setting but an Acura dealer took car of 
it without no hassle.

I only give ""build Quality"" a ""9"" and 
all others 10. I used to have a '96 
Honda Accord EX and it had no problems 
up to 134,600 miles (sold it 
afterwards) so I expect this SUV to 
last."
acura,mdx,2003,frankyy, 12/08/2002,excellent SUV from Acura!,pos,"I have driven my MDX (03) for 10 days. 
It's good timing as we have had lots 
of snow and rain in past 2 weeks. MDX 
handles the snow and rain very well. 
Good performance and smooth handling. 
You don'y have to take my words here.  
But just test drive all suv's in the 
MDX class (X5/ML320/RX300 etc). You 
would like the MDX!"
acura,mdx,2003,stsweetser, 12/09/2002,My Review,pos,"I have owned the Acura MDX for one week 
and I love this vehicle.  The ride is 
smooth, the noise level is minimal and 
the style and luxury compares to my 
luxury sedan."
acura,mdx,2003,shark3716, 12/15/2002,sheer amazement,pos,"this car is amazing...we looked at 
several suvs including the new lexus, 
other lexus suvs, the volvo, the 
mercedes-benz, and the bmw...this one 
beat them all. the navigation system 
is amazing and same for the 
entertainment system. make sure to get 
the touring package."
acura,mdx,2003,Lord of the house, 12/14/2002,My new Best friend,pos,"Buying the 2003 MDX with the Rear 
entertainment system was not a total 
suprise for me. What was a suprise is 
the pleasure I get from it. It has 
more of everything I want. More room, 
more power and a great ride."
acura,mdx,2003,PDTEXAS, 12/17/2002,BEST GETS BETTER,pos,"JUST TRADED A 2OO2 TL S TYPE FOR THIS 
MDX. RIDE IS SMOOTHER AND QUIETER.
SEATS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE. NEW 
SUSPENSION CONTROLS VEHICLE WELL AT 
HIGH SPEEDS.
SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING.
WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE"

acura,mdx,2003,will4271, 12/28/2002,Go buy it now.,pos,"Test drove the MDX, RX300, Highlander, 
ML320, X5, 4Runner, Sequioa and other 
SUV. This is most accomodating for a 
family. Great power and the stops are 
short and straight."
acura,mdx,2003,vfdvddssdvsvdsfds, 01/02/2003,great car,pos,"this is definetly the best value around 
the rx cost 40k and is small and rattly 
the ml320 has poor preformance and can 
fit the most.  i love this car."
acura,mdx,2003,Hiker23, 01/03/2003,After lots of research...a happy driver,pos,"A great deal of time was spent in 
researching and comparing vehicles 
(thank you Edmunds!). During 
our ""quest"" we looked at the Toyota 
Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan 
Pathfinder, Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Lexus 
GX470.
All have great build quality but the 
value equation for the MDX was the 
best.  It represented the perfect blend 
between family hauling, luxury, 
and ""sportiness"" for us.  The 260 hp 
certainly gets it moving in a hurry 
(unsuspecting drivers are quickly 
dispatched to the rear-view mirror)but 
this is no Boxster S. Needless to say I 
expect to get atleast 10 years of 
faithful service from this great 
machine."
acura,mdx,2003,shag, 01/07/2003,I love this vehicle !!!,pos,"We had to wait 5 long months before we 
took home our beautiful MDX, but it 
was well worth the wait. Can't say 
enough great things about this SUV. It 
is so comfortable and easy to drive. 
Not to mention it is pretty classy 
looking to boot. I especially love the 
ease of raising/lowering the seats to 
fit our trunk needs."
acura,mdx,2003,owahn, 01/14/2003,Great value in luxury category,pos,"The Navigation system is simply amazing.
Space is great, we can go with friends,
8 people not a problem. It's the first 
car where I actually need to study the 
manuals though because there are just 
so many gadgets. Fuel economy is said 
to be the best, so I feel ok about it, 
although I hope car makers will still 
be able to improve on this. The only 
snag was that I had to wait 3 months
for the car."
acura,mdx,2003,theprop, 01/20/2003,perfect SUV,pos,"Powerful, strong build.  A car hit my 
MDX back bumper, MDX didn't scratch a 
bit,  the other car broke the radiator 
and damaged most of the front parts.  
14-22 mile per gal.  Nav. system is 
accurate and fun, Calculator and 
calendar feature are great."
acura,mdx,2003,MDXOVERXC90, 01/21/2003,MDXOVERXC90,pos,"The best SUV on the market for it's 
class and lots of values for your $$$$$
The car perform superb both on and off 
road include in rain and snow 
condition.
All in a 10++++++++++ Keep up the good 
work ACURA."
acura,mdx,2003,Alexandra Azevedo, 01/22/2003,I'd buy it again,pos,"It rides very good and smooth. Could 
have more room in the front, I had a 
Town and Country before so I fell a 
little tight sometimes. 3rd row is 
confortable,my 10 year old rides there 
all the time.There are lots of room 
for cargo in the back. If you consider 
an entertainment system, get it 
factory installed, I'm having a hard 
time to get one, it is difficult to 
install because of the sunroof, and 
the headrest would only fit a 4"" 
monitor, too small...Plus, there is 
not much room for a dvd player under 
the seats. My kids are disappointed! I 
enjoy driving my MDX and most of all I 
enjoy my Bose sound system!"
acura,mdx,2003,American Tim, 01/24/2003,Getcha One!,pos,"I originally hail from the Detroit 
area and my family has always bought 
vehicles made by American 
manufacturers.  After serious 
reliability problems with our 1999 Jeep 
Grand Cherokee, we decided to look at 
foreign brands.  We were pleasantly 
surprised to discover the Acura MDX.  
The build quality is far superior to 
any midsize SUV offered by GM, Ford, or 
Chrysler. And, I'm hoping Acura's 
reputation for reliability will help me 
keep the MDX on the road and out of the 
dealership's garage. The list of 
standard features is quite lengthy.  If 
you are looking for a luxury vehicle 
with a not-so-luxury price, then the 
MDX is for you!  Getcha one!"
acura,mdx,2003,HrdTsk, 01/25/2003,Acura MDX,pos,"Very Nice ride good handling with 
creature comfortxs inside and lots of 
pep to go"
acura,mdx,2003,Jed, 01/27/2003,Fun Vehicle,pos,"Decided on the MDX after driving a BMW 
330CI for 1.5 year and needed a family 
car. Father has an X5 and the MDX, I 
feel, had most of the same qualities.  
A little less power, but hey its half 
the price of the 4.4 X5.  Good car for 
the money.  Used to own a 4-Runner and 
the power of the MDX blows it away."
acura,mdx,2003,Robin & Penny, 01/28/2003,Classic Acura,pos,"Classic Acura, consertive styling, good 
(not excellent) interior materials, 
outstanding reliability!!  I checked 
out four luxury SUVs (MDX, GX 470, X5, 
XC90) and the MDX was the most versitle 
(Seating 7 and excellent performance)
and was, what I thought to be the BEST 
value.  The GX 470 was really nice but 
you had to pay an extra $9 K and the 8 
cylinder has 25 less HP. The X5 has an 
aweful relibility rating, and the XC 90 
was nice but just too small - The MDX 
Wins!!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,MyMDX, 01/30/2003,New MDX,pos,"Just picked up my new MDX.  What a 
fantastic car, comfortable seats and 
plenty of space.  Trade in my 2000 TL 
w/nav, this car is even more 
comfortable on the highway!"
acura,mdx,2003,steve_seattle, 01/31/2003,The X rocks,pos,"I have been very pleased with the MDX. I traded in my M3, because of the kids and skiing. I thought I would really miss it, but the MDX is great. A great car in the snow and, for such a large car, it is very fun to drive. I would recomend it to anyone in the SUV market. Plus the 6 hr drive to the mountains is realatively painless with the DVD system!"
acura,mdx,2003,vinnie, 01/31/2003,excellent vehicle,pos,"SLAM DUNK FOR 
ACURA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,buttons, 02/01/2003,A excellent SUV,pos,"Spent a year testing SUV's. I finally 
had to decide between the new Lexus 
GX470 and the MDX. I choose the MDX 
because although the Lexus had a 
larger engine I couldn't justify the 
additional $12,000. Had to wait 6 
weeks for delivery, but I'm not 
dissapointed."
acura,mdx,2003,Jerry Randolph, 02/04/2003,Brother to purchaser,pos,"Having driven with my sister in her 
newly purchased 2002 MDX, the 
solidness, the control of the steering 
mechanism, the voluntary movement of 
the inner controls of the car taking 
turns, curves, up and dowwnhill 
movements were excellent."
acura,mdx,2003,Laurena , 02/05/2003,Hands down the best SUV on the market!,pos,"After having tested out the 
BMW,VOLVO,TOYOTA,ACURA,INFINITI,LEXUS,H
ONDA,AND MITSUBISHI.I found myself 
with only one vehicle that not only 
caught the emotional side of me,but 
also the important practical, and 
family oriented side. Basically to 
make a long story short I spent 2 
months learning everythng humanly 
possilbe about everyone of these 
vehicles, and the Acura MDX by far 
took the lead.Once I purchased the 
vehicle I was reminded of the 0 
scheduled maintenence for 105k miles, 
and 7,500 miles for every oil change.  
To anyone reading you MUST,and I mean 
MUST look into the Acura MDX before 
you purchase an SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,Plateau KD, 02/09/2003,"Excellent, driving machine !",pos,"Before I buy MDX, I took test drive 
othe Suv's like, Mercedes ML, BMW MX, 
Toyota LC.
This was the best car I've ever driven.
It's fast, stable, yet I can still feel 
like a sport car. Eye catching design 
on the road too."
acura,mdx,2003,popejohn, 02/10/2003,2003 Base Model in Sagebrush,pos,"Have had the car for almost two months 
now.  Very satisfied with the looks, 
ride, and quality.  Car actually has 
more power and driving comfort than I 
expected.  I have to remind myself I am 
driving an SUV and not go too fast into 
curves - it really feels like driving a 
much smaller vehicle.  Really like the 
Sagebrush color - looks very dark at 
night, but looks almost grey in 
sunlight.  Gets decent gas mileage - 
17.5 mpg in mostly city driving."
acura,mdx,2003,goodsofar, 02/19/2003,great to date,pos,"Have had my MDX for two weeks and so 
far it's great.  Drove 4Runner, M350, 
MDX and was headed to BMW but never got 
there.  Had a Tahoe previously and the 
MDX handles better, has a more carlike 
ride, better standard features, and was 
less to purchase.  Gave a 9 on exterior 
design only because side door moldings 
are an add on.  Alittle concerned with 
possible door dings in parking lots. 
This SUV has delivered style, ride, 
efficiency, safety, and comfort at a 
very affordable price.  The 5 star 
safety rating is a plus.  I drive a car 
for a long time and I'm hopeful this 
vehicle will deliver many years of 
maintenance free miles."
acura,mdx,2003,mista, 02/22/2003,Best SUV - MDX,pos,"Bought for my wife, I drive a RL. Most 
surprised by car like feel and ride. If 
this Acura product is as good as the 
others I have owned, then we will have 
this for a long time.

Handling is the best of all SUV that I 
have been in (MB-320,Expedition,Yukon 
and Jeep)."
acura,mdx,2003,Gena, 06/10/2003,Chose MDX over Lexus GX470,pos,"I chose the MDX over the Lexus GX470 
for the price, gas mileage, drive and 
options.  The MDX has plenty of 
options.  It handles very well, has an 
awesome sound system, a great 
navigation system, and plenty of room--
the middle row fits three car seats (I 
have three little ones) and there's 
still plenty of room in the back for 
strollers, groceries, and other items 
with the third row folded down.  It 
accelerates very well/quickly for an 
SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2003,Dr.Mo, 06/10/2003,worth the wait,pos,"fun to drive. Sharp style which is 
distinctive. Very comfortable. I put my 
deposit down and took 3 months to look 
at the competition. It was a no 
brainer. Much nicer than the Lexus 
which was too feminine(sorry ladies, 
but my wife agrees). Navigation system 
is awsome!!"
acura,mdx,2003,BuddyP, 07/14/2003,Fine SUV,pos,"Overall very happy. Just passed 4000 
miles in 6 weeks. Excellent build 
quality, quiet and generally 
comfortable. Underpowered compared to 
American competition, especially from a 
dead stop. Gas mileage slightly less 
than EPA. "
acura,mdx,2003,vcolangelo, 07/11/2003,My 2003 MDX SS/S Navi Review,pos,"The good news is the MDX is built by 
Honda and its build quality, ride, 
quiet cabin and overall look and feel 
are well above anything experienced 
with any of my previous GM, Jeep and 
Ford SUV's .  The bad news is the MDX 
is serviced by Honda. If Honda could 
learn how to service their their luxury 
Acura line like Toyota did with Lexus, 
it would be perfect.  I love my MDX, 
but I love the service my wife gets 
with her less expensive Lexus GS more.  
Common Acura owner service complaints 
include: no free pick up and delivery 
service; no free loaner; and, no 
feeling that there's a service person 
at Acura who really takes an interest 
in your car. "
acura,mdx,2003,Rickster, 07/13/2003,Awesome Acura,pos,"My Acura MDX has been great from day one. 
The handling of the vehicle has been better 
than my Grand Cherokee. My only complaint is 
that the gas mileage could be a little better in 
the city. Highway is great."
acura,mdx,2003,flip, 07/17/2003,Perfect vehice,pos,"I live In the Seirra Foothills, the MDX 
Is just right In terms Of comfort, 
safty and well It does have the best 
looks vs BMW Toyota etc. I had a 2001 
Navi, (It was totaled)I own a 03 now. 
we were hit head on and walk away 
without any Injuries, so safe. In 
short.... an OUTSTANGING SUV period. 
Saved our life ??? "
acura,mdx,2003,LuvMyAcura, 07/24/2003,Best SUV I've ever owned,pos,"If you're considering an SUV in this

comfortable, quick acceleration, and 
stylish.  This MDX turns heads!"

only owned this car for 3 months and 
already I am having problems with 
rattling.  The engine is sometimes 
noisy as well.  I've contacted the 
dealer and they said that's just how 
this car is.  My car is too new to be 
rattling like this.  Also, the 
entertainment system doesn't seem too 
sturdy.  This SUV is not worth the high 
price!  Buyer beware!"
acura,mdx,2003,mry, 07/31/2003,New MDX,pos,"Had a Jeep for 7 years, loved the 
Cadilliac EXT, but too expensive.  
Volvo was not helpful at all and too 
expensive to wait 3 months for XC90. 
Plus didnt have the power of MDX.  
Acura of Memphis was great and they 
really sold the car on their 
personality and willing to work with me 
on the trade-in.  MDX had all the 
features I wanted and definitely moves 
when you step on the gas.  I have only 
heard good things about the Acura 
service in Memphis, and most everyone 
loves their MDX.  Felt the price was 
great for all the features we were 
getting, good crash test ratings and 
didn't have to do the 'a la carte' menu 
like Volvo or Lexus [GX or Lx series]"
acura,mdx,2003,mdx-er, 08/05/2003,Drives Like a Car,pos,"750 miles into our Touring MDX and

acura,mdx,2003,r.g.harrison, 08/05/2003,Disappointed,pos,"I drove a 3.2Tl for 90k with never a 
glitch, but the MDX is a different 
story.  It's been back to the shop 3 
times for engine warning lights; a 
high-altitude problem my Colorado 
dealer says, and tells me Acura is 
working on it.  The voice activated 
nav system doesn't recognize all the 
commands it's supposed to --  
again,I'm told Acura is working on 
it.  GM uses customers as test 
drivers, but I expected more from 
Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,apersistent1, 08/06/2003,Don't waste your money,pos,"This is the worst QUALITY car I have 
owned in 25 years.  You would not 
expect a luxury car have constant 
noises and problems.  First, noise in 
front wheel well that took 3 weeks to 
find/fix.  Next, the sound of the fuel 
sloshing in the fuel tank - Acura says 
its ""normal"" for this car.  Next, 
stereo speakers in the doors started 
vibrating.  Next, door noises.  Turns 
out the seal ""needs lubricating"".  
Next, the brakes make a clunking 
noise - Acura says a ""slight 
clicking"".  Whenever you shift, and 
apply the brakes, the 
calipers ""adjust"".  Acura says this is 
normal. Caliper adjustment IS, the 
noise ISNT!  "
acura,mdx,2003,car dude, 08/06/2003,All arounder,pos,"A great family car.  My wife drives the 
kids around.  Just went camping - Thule 
box on top, 4 bikes on the hitch and 
cruised the mountains with 3 kids 
watching a DVD in the back.  Up and 
down between sea level and 2700 ft. and 
got 21 miles to the gallon. No problem.
Take features, luxury, size, ride, 
performance, handling, price.  This car 
is an 8 or 9 across everything.  What 
other car can do that?"

acura,mdx,2003,djcurrie32, 08/14/2003,What constructive criticism can I find?,pos,"The Acura MDX is second to none in this 
price range for a luxury SUV, Acura has 
always fitted its vehicles with 
standard options that would be a la 
carte on most luxury lines, example 
heated seats, sunroof, memory seats, 6 
disc CD changer, rain sensing wipers, 
rear view camera etc...After extensive 
research and with the fold down third 
seat this was the vehicle for my 
family, it rides smooth, great 
acceleration and handling, outstanding 
exterior styling.."
acura,mdx,2003,WALF3, 08/13/2003,Gas Mileage Rip off,pos,"I've had my MDX for 5 months and am
truely dismayed at the gas mileage.  The
sticker reads 17 to 22,  but I get 13-14
mpg driving 70/30 city/hwy.   And when I
bring it to the dealer, they have some
excuse like its winter gas or we can't
know your driving habits.  Well I've
been driving for 30 years and never had
such rotten gas mileage.  And it takes
premium gas to make it worse.
Don't believe that sticker.. you're in
for a shock."
acura,mdx,2003,FG, 08/13/2003,Roof Rack Stink,pos,"Even though I love my MDX the only 
thing bad is the Roof Racks.  First of 
all they are too close to each other to 
put any soft storage carriers.  If you 
want to get a hard cargo top its not 
compatible to 99% of non-dealer 
companies.  The Acura's cargo carries 
is priced twice as much and half the 
space of THULE's brand.  So if your 
going to buy the MDX, save some money 
and don't include them in the package."
acura,mdx,2003,Sandranna, 08/16/2003,I Love My MDX,pos,"Researched cars 3 yrs, chose MDX.Waited 
9 mos (switch from '02 to '03,delayed 
it a few months).Well worth the wait! I 
accessorized it so it's the sharpest 
one I've seen yet.Very sporty!I'm 54, 
had a Buick LeSabre for 11 yrs.Needed 
something sharp, sporty. I drive safer 
now: with it's weight, it's a weapon. 
It's L/W are same as my Buick, but it 
took me a long time to get used to driv-
ing it.I did purchase a larger rearview 
mirror for help with backing up. Didn't 
know about the rear camera when I 
bought this; that whole package is EX-
PENSIVE but I&#8217;d now consider it to help 
with backing up. A great car,passengers 
love it, & I plan to keep it 15-20 yrs!"
acura,mdx,2003,Poppa Mike, 08/14/2003,My First Acura MDX,pos,"Probably will never buy anything
other than an MDX.  Love it !
Wish we had ordered the entertainment
system."
acura,mdx,2003,cavender, 08/17/2003,acura mdx,pos,"After having owned Explorer Limiteds, 
and having driven Lexus, Mercedes, GMC, 
Toyota, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and other 
SUV's, this is definitely and clearly 
the best luxury SUV for the money.  
Extremely low maintenance and excellent 
dealer service.  Very quiet but 
powerful.  Comfortable ride, high 
visibility, well-built, good tracking, 
very versatile, packs a lot of gear.
Have never used the thrid seat, and 
luckily, it folds flat so it offers 
good storage in back.  This is easily 
the best SUV on the market.  I told 
Ford I would never be back."
acura,mdx,2003,OverTime1, 08/20/2003,Excellent vehicle,pos,"After looking closely at the Volvo 
XC90 my wife and I ended up with the 
MDX. We now have over 7500 miles on it 
and it has been TREMENDOUS vehicle. 
Outstanding ride quality, power, 
comfort and utility."
acura,mdx,2003,very happy, 08/20/2003,great value,pos,"I looked at many midsize luxury SUV's 
and this offered the best quality/cost 
of ownership/luxury for the price.  I 
have really enjoyed owning this vehicle"
acura,mdx,2003,PVoyiatzis, 08/22/2003,One awesome SUV!,pos,"One week out of the dealership, I got 
rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic by a 
Nissan.  Hardly realizing what had 
happened, I stepped out of my MDX only 
to see a TOTALLED Nissan.  I knew the 
MDX was well built, but I was still 
surprised to see that my MDX had ZERO 
damage.  I even brought it to 3 
mechanics, including the dealer just to 
rest my soul, and they found nothing 
wrong with my MDX.  I must say from 
experience that I have never driven an 
SUV (luxury or not) with this type of 
strength.

This SUV also drives awesome over 80 
mph!"
acura,mdx,2003,hiker, 08/23/2003,high country,pos,"have driven suvs in the past forget it
this is the ticket i do limited off road
but plenty of bad curvy mountain roads
and this vehicle eats them up i have
found it does great in rainy conditios
and dirt roads i get about 16mpg  in
mountains and 13mpg in city"
acura,mdx,2003,DILITE, 08/22/2003,Not bad SUV,pos,"I own my MDX for over 4 month a few
rattle's in sun roof and left rear. Gas
mileage 15 in city 21 highway. A little
expense on maintenance. The ride is smooth 
and handling is wonderful. "
acura,mdx,2003,eric is cool, 08/23/2003,wonderful,pos,its a great car for the price!!
acura,mdx,2003,GMoneyGrill, 08/26/2003,Bling Bling,pos,"I've had my fully-loaded 2003 MDX since 
March and I absolutely love it! I've 
researched it since 2001 and found it 
to be the best all-around SUV for the 
money. Love the 260 HP and after owning 
it for almost 6 months (11,000 miles 
already), I found things I like and 
dislike. I like the power/torque, 5-
speed tranny! style, features (ala-
backup camera, navi system-
breadcrumbs!, DVD-wireless headphones, 
moonroof, memory/heated FRONT SEATS, 
BOSE stereo, auto wiper/headlights, and 
2nd/3rd row fold-flat seats. Things I 
dislike are the lack of storage in the 
front area, premium gas, towing 
capacity, no dead pedal, 
navi system seems outdated, interior 
plastics."
acura,mdx,2003,Edward Bianchina, 08/26/2003,Mr,pos,"Great Vehicle. Fun to drive and 
comfortable. Interior very functional."
acura,mdx,2003,ks, 02/28/2003,what to expect from Honda,pos,"I have loved this car from day one
I owned 2 other Honda's in the past and 
was extreemely happy with them
I am conviced that this MDX will not be 
any different
Still the best looking SUV out there"
acura,mdx,2003,sad Customer, 08/28/2003,Not so happy owner,pos,"Middle Row seat is very uncomfortable. 
Wire mesh dog barrier and the plastic 
housing keeps popping out. Took 10-15 
minutes of trying to start on two 
occasions. On the first few feet of 
driving  either forward or backward 
makes a klunking noise.The acceleration 
has a lag.Revs up to 4K in first and 
second gear.The simulated wood interior 
is just fake looking.This is my 4th 
Acura. I have a 99 TL as well and with 
the TL and the MDX it seems Acura is 
trying to please everyone but has 
dropped it's quality and standard. 
ACURA should throw in less features and 
worry more about their reptation as a 
seamless car manufacturer. As for me I 
think this is my last Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,theinspector, 08/29/2003,THE MDX IS WELL WORTH THE $$$$$$$ !!!!,pos,"I've spent many months researching and 
test driving other vehicles in the 
MDX's class. Compared to the BMW X5, 
Volvo XC90, Lexus RX330,Infiniti 
FX35/45, the MDX wins hands down! You 
can't buy a better equipped and safer 
vehicle for the $$ than the MDX. Also, 
as with any Honda product, you will 
never have to worry about reliability 
and resale values."
acura,mdx,2003,rixmax, 09/01/2003,Great New SUV,pos,"Some friends of ours have an MDX that 
is a few years old and they loved 
theirs s we thought we'd look into 
them.  Wow!  What a great vehichle that 
looks great, tons of bells and 
whistles, great safety features... we 
could go on and on!"
acura,mdx,2003,CHERYL WARREN, 09/06/2003,CHERYLS OPINION,pos,"THIS VEHICHLE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND 
DOES NOT HAVE THE TRUCK RIDE THAT MANY 
OTHER MODELS HAVE.IT IS FUN TO DRIVE 
AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE. I LOVE IT!"
acura,mdx,2003,EK1988, 09/06/2003,A GOOD CHOICE,pos," A GOOD VEHICLE - WE DEBATED BETWEEN 
THE ACURA AND A 4 RUNNER LIMITED.  SAME 
PRICE BUT BETTER FEATURES IN THE 
ACURA.  TIME AND CONTINUED USE WILL 
DICTATE VALUE."
acura,mdx,2003,jeannie, 09/06/2003,I love my suv,pos,"I love this car. What more can I can?  
Fun to drive-you bet! Handling-WOW!  I 
bought it for realiability and I have 
gotten so much more!"
acura,mdx,2003,MOM MOBILE, 09/06/2003,lOVE THAT CAR,pos,"I absolutely love the car.  Coming from 
a minivan it is a welcome relief.  the 
only thing I do not like about the car 
is the small gas tank size.  I am 
constantly filling up with gas.  I like 
the navigational system and use it 
frequently. I also like the camera that 
shows what is behind me when I am 
backing up. "
acura,mdx,2003,Snyder, 09/06/2003,Great Car,pos,"Navigation system is fantastic for big 
city like Atlanta and is VERY easy to 
use. The MDX has GREAT pep to get 
around on the highways. Interior setup 
very practical. Love it!  "
acura,mdx,2003,LoveMyMDX, 09/06/2003,I love It,pos,"This car has everything it 
promised..high quality, fun to drive, 
navigation, back-up camera and the kids 
love the entertainment system."
acura,mdx,2003,songb42, 09/06/2003,Extremely Satisfied,pos,"I am completely satisfied with this 
vehicle.  My MDX drives like a car, but 
has the power of a truck.  It is very 
comfortable and fun to drive."
acura,mdx,2003,me plus 3, 09/06/2003,Acura for a family,pos,"I chose the MDX after trying out just 
about every mid-size SUV available.  
The MDX has the most interior room 
(almost as much as some of the large 
SUVs) and fared well in crash tests.  
Overall, I am very happy with it.  My 
husband and I are both tall and we have 
2 babies, double stroller, etc, 2 car 
seats, but still roomy.  It rides well, 
is okay with gas for an SUV.  I love 
the option of the 2 back seats 
(although not the most comfortable)
The only area that needs attention is 
the interior (which does not both me) - 
It is plain, very simple features, not 
much on the dashboard as far as 
extras.  "
acura,mdx,2003,mikeandjudy, 09/06/2003,Outstanding SUV,pos,"Nothing to dislike about this vehicle.  
Perfect size SUV for small family.  Has 
not disappointed us at all.  Wonderful 
on trips and around town (easy to 
park).  Comfortable, roomy and a great 
sound system."
acura,mdx,2003,Angelastarr, 09/06/2003,My new MDX,pos,"By no means bland, the Acura MDX is 
surefooted off the road and elegant on 
the road.It handles like a dream.  The 
extra width in the back, about 6"" more 
than most SUVs, allows for an 
airmattress for safer camping and helps 
me in my volunteer work which involves 
transporting cats and kittens for 
healthcare and adoption.  So the fuel 
efficiency doesn't bother me.  I have 
the best of both worlds...a truck and a 
sports car."
acura,mdx,2003,geneo212, 09/06/2003,Geno's MDX,pos,"The MDX is a comfortable and versatile 
vehicle.  The beauty of an Acura is 
that you get so much as standard 
equipment.  I compared the MDX with the 
BMW X5.  There was no way to keep the 
price point anywhere close to the MDX 
with the same trim options. The X5 is a 
great driving vehicle, but the MDX is 
just fit the bill more overall."
acura,mdx,2003,Alexander Kopitko, 09/08/2003,One of the best SUV on the market,pos,"We bought this car last week after 
testing Murano. It's bigger, more 
powerfull, more comfortable."
acura,mdx,2003,jhc, 09/09/2003,"Great car, but dealership needs to imprv",pos,"What a great car.  This is my second 
Acura.  My first Acura was TL and it 
was a good experience overall.  Hoping 
the same experience, but for MDX the 
dealerships were too arrogant.  I 
almost did not buy this car until I 
went to this dealership where I bought 
it from.  Had to buy this car, because
there is nothing else that could match
the features/performance/quality at 
this price."
acura,mdx,2003,Dr. Joel Adler, 09/13/2003,The Best SUV on the market today,pos,"This is my third Acura but my first SUV.
I am very pleased with this and my 
other Acuras, as I have never had to 
take the vehicles into be service.  The 
quality of workmenship is excellent. I 
have over my live time purchased over 
forty new vehicles for personal use and 
all other vehicles needed warranty 
work.I do use this vehicle (SUV) for 
personal use and also as a tow vehicle 
behind my motorhome.  It pulls very 
easy on all four wheels and I do not 
notice the extra weight behind my 
motorhome."
acura,mdx,2003,AnnW., 09/16/2003,Love my MDX,pos,"I love the smooth and comfort ride in 
the MDX. I had to test the Break once, 
and I was pleased with its 
performance. There is much more room 
in the 2nd row than our other SUV. And 
the 3rd is very easy to use and 
getting into. "
acura,mdx,2003,gordon wheaton, 09/16/2003,2003 MDX (Loaded),pos,"I was actually contacted by two dealers 
in Houston who wanted my 2001 MDX to 
meet used car MDX customer demand. I 
decided to trade mine in when a new 
2003 load arrived. My 2001 sold the 
same day I picked up my upgraded 2003 
(fully loaded). I was surprised at the 
improved performance/comfort/sound 
system since I really had great success 
with 2001. I researched and found MDX 
still the best SUV on the market bar 
none!"
acura,mdx,2003,hermantam, 07/21/2003,Value-for-money champ,pos,"- Superior value over Lexus
- Reliability over most European brands 
per JD Power (I traded-in my 
problematic ML for the MDX)
- Sportier than the RX and GX: precise 
steering, great engine
- Better looking than the FX"
acura,mdx,2003,X-um, 07/20/2003,Simply the best,pos,"This is the best SUV EVER.  All others 
still attempt to copy it but perfectly 
can't be duplicated, just immitated."
acura,mdx,2003,carolyn, 07/23/2003,Love my MDX,pos,"I am so thrilled with my new MDX.  It 
handles so well on the road, and I feel 
so comfortable and safe driving it.  I 
previously have driven a Lexus...and a 
Volvo both always top of the line.  But 
I prefer the MDX over both of these 
other cars.  And the value is 
incredible."
acura,mdx,2003,j mig, 08/07/2003,excellant,pos,"This SUV is excellant. I love it-with a 
child it has plenty of room. the car 
drives great & believe it or not-its 
great on gas."
acura,mdx,2003,mr c., 08/08/2003,Quality,pos,Just a great car to drive
acura,mdx,2003,mdx by al, 08/08/2003,2003 mdx,pos,"great suv. tested the lexus, bmw, 
ford, gmc ect. no question for the 
money the mdx is the hands down 
favorite. ride is execellent, the 
quality is first rate."
acura,mdx,2003,Tedd Slugg, 08/12/2003,A Very Typical Acura - Great!,pos,"Quite simply it is the best value in a 
luxury SUV on the market. Big 
enough to haul lots of  ""stuff"", but 
handles much like my ACURA RL. My 
wife loves the way it handles and 
does not have to climb in-and-out 
like many higher SUVs. Easily the 
best SUV we test drove - and we tried 
them all - and its sticker price is 
realitively low. Just can't beat the 
overall package."
acura,mdx,2003,heather , 08/27/2003,mdx is the best,pos,"The MDX rides smooth, it is extremly 
comfortable and drives like a luxury 
car.  I can fit seven people plus a 
stroller and a picnic.   It is truly like 
having a luxury car and SUV in one.  I 
had a suburban and this is so much 
better that I cannot believe I ever 
owned a suburban.  I love it and will 
only get rid of it to give it to my 
daughter when she drives and then 
buy another one for myself!"
acura,mdx,2003,dk, 08/28/2003,Superb entry lux SUV,pos,"If you're interested in a 7-seater lux 
SUV, the MDX is for you. The exterior 
design is conservative but appealing. 
The leather seats are very good, but 
other interior materials could be 
improved. The V6 has lively 
performance, but at the expense of 
poor gas mileage in low gear (I'd love 
a hybrid of this vehicle!). The 3rd 
row seats sold us, together with very 
well balanced safety features inside 
and out--such as the VTM-4 and VSA."
acura,mdx,2003,KBarker, 09/03/2003,future lemon???,pos,"smooth engine and drive train. for the 
money it should have power lumbar 
seats. fuel economy on the sticker is a 
wishful dream!!  taken back to dealer 
twice the first two weeks!! had to 
replace parts on the a/c due to loosing 
all the freon. they say that's a first 
for them. hope this is not a trend!! 
easy to drive and great turning 
radius.  regret spending so much for an 
suv though. at least with a tahoe you 
know the milage is bad and more power!!"
acura,mdx,2003,asmdpa, 09/19/2003,best Suv we bought ever,pos,"we have only 3000 miles on our 2003 
touring MDX and we already love it.
This is our third SUV and we had best 
dealership experience so far.
Mdx is powerful, reliable in bad 
weather and we give it a 10"
acura,mdx,2003,Michael Anderson, 09/19/2003,Surprised...,pos,"I'm a former RL owner, and was 
pleasently surprised that the MDX 
offeres all the creature comforts of 
the RL, with the Storage capacity of a 
truck.  The ride is better than that of 
the RL in my opinion, probably due to 
the improved suspension system."
acura,mdx,2003,Debi & Ira Weiss, 09/19/2003,Try it and You will buy it!,pos," Previous to test driving this SUV my 
husband and I sat across from one at a 
red light and he said he did not like 
it, while test driving the BMW  SUV 
(along with 8 other manufactures.  The 
salesperson recommended this for our 
needs of our family, by that night my 
husband had a new love.  Almost 1 year 
later and we feel that it was one of 
our best purchases. It has been a real 
pleasure.  "
acura,mdx,2003,vncjj, 09/23/2003,Stitch,pos,Good Great Fuel Ecocomy To Buy
acura,mdx,2003,Tadgh45, 09/30/2003,mdx 2003,pos,"I was an original 2001 MDX owner and 
loved every minute of it.Auto Week's 
excellent test of the vehicle in 
Belize convinced me that this vehicle 
was for me. So,2 brief years later,it 
was a no brainer on what my next 
vehicle would be.All I can say about 
the 2003 MDX is that Acura actually 
improved on what I thought could have 
no improvement.I LOVE it! Bravo,Acura!"
acura,mdx,2003,Bobkes, 09/25/2003,Best SUV yet,pos,"This Acura is the third suv I have 
owned, after driving a 1996 Jeep Grand 
Cherokee, and a  1997 Nissan 
Pathfinder. It is the best yet. Drives 
and handles like a car with no 
skittishness in the corners, with wide 
comfortable seats, good head room, and 
a comfortable driving position. Plenty 
of power when you need it, and great in 
snow.
other than gravel trails. Feel it is 
the best Suv out there now, others are 
too small, too trucklike, or too 
expensive for what you get.Small peeve, 
picked up a couple of parking lot door 
dings because of no side moulding 
protection, metal dents easily. Good 
ride so far, will see how it does after 
some more miles."
acura,mdx,2003,amarlow, 09/25/2003,MDX - good but not great,pos,"Bought MDX about 6 weeks ago.  Really 
like it except that I find the drivers 
seat very uncomfortable (too firm) and 
there is an annoying rattle that I 
need to take back to dealer to fix.  
Looked at many SUV's and thought this 
was the whole package.  "
acura,mdx,2003,ppg, 10/03/2003,Awsome SUV,pos,"It's a great SUV, compared to what we 
have in the market.  The Volvo XC90 
fairs well too, but this one has lots 
of features which the Volvo does not 
have and costs lots more when you buy 
the pacakges."
acura,mdx,2003,GAaliveDRIVE, 10/04/2003,Why want more?,pos,"This is a vehicle that satisfies in 
most every area required.   Highly 
competent handling, power, roominess, 
when combined with the sweet purr of 
the V6 Honda engine could bring a 
smile to the most ardent critic.   I 
considered many others before driving 
the MDX and knew in an instant that 
this one, although not perfect in 
every regard, was the one.    

Come to think of it, what ONE vehicle 
is perfect in every respect?   The 
answer is NONE of them.   The MDX 
comes as close to doing everything 
well that I've encountered."
acura,mdx,2003,CorpusD, 10/06/2003,MDX touring w/NAV,pos,"Overall this vehicle has met my 
expectations. I was leary at first 
because I have never owned a japanese 
build vehicle. However the quality and 
value for you rmoney are well worth 
it. The whole family loves it and is 
perfect for a midsized SUV. The 3rd 
row seats are also a plus."
acura,mdx,2003,elcuban, 10/10/2003,good decision,pos,"after been trying diferents SUV's that 
was the the best decision,looks a 
superfast vehicule ,i only have 
300,its a lot of fun.the navigation 
sistem is great.all the instrument are 
excellent,comfort,stabiliy are 
excellent.   thanks"
acura,mdx,2003,vcnyc, 10/11/2003,Acura MDX,pos,"The MDX is fun to drive and extremely 
responsive in harsh weather.  It breaks 
on the dime in rain and snow.  The 
interior is extremely comfortable and 
spacious.  My only disappointment is 
fuel economy.  I am averaging 14 mpg in 
the city and 20 on the highway."
acura,mdx,2003,blue opal, 10/11/2003,excellen toverall,pos,"Beautiful car has third row, lots of 
power, dependable good in snow , 
excelleent daily driver.  Pound for 
pound the BEST suv in its class."
acura,mdx,2003,Caper, 10/13/2003,Beautiful,pos,Love it!!  The blue is a hot color!!
acura,mdx,2003,Mattyloudness, 10/13/2003,A Super SUV,pos,"A ton of room and flexibility with the 
seating, and it drives great at 75mph!  
So smooth and quiet and handles 
perfect.  It also gives you so many 
options that are standard you do not 
have to add anything to it!  It's our 
first SUV and glad to have it!"
acura,mdx,2003,Fabvsix, 10/15/2003,On the road again........,pos,"Having come from an Acura CL Type S, I 
thought I was in a CL on steroids ! I 
can only speak on behalf of the 03's 
which I understand got alot of 
improvements ! Steering at higher 
speeds is superb. Acceleration is silky 
smooth, this vehicle has PLENTY of get 
up and go ! Braking is fine too ! The 
seats are as comfortable as the CL's ! 
I think the CL has the most comfortable 
seats in the Acura line up ! Yes that 
includes those NSX seats......As far as 
build quality, Acura needs to ""beef it 
up"", as they have dropped. Upon 
delivery, I had numerious fixes needed. 
Of course Acura took care of all. Since 
all is dandy. I would highly recommend 
this vehicle ! "
acura,mdx,2003,CD52, 10/18/2003,A delightful experience,pos,"This car has lived up to its reputation as a 
terrific family-friendly, luxury SUV (family-
friendly because why else would you have the 
DVD entertainment system?). It's fun to drive, 
configurable for a zillion different needs, and 
comfortable beyond what we expected. It 
compares favorably with our other car -- A 
Mercedes E Class sedan."
acura,mdx,2004,Jill G., 09/08/2016,400k miles strong,pos,"This car was the best investment in a car we have ever made.  My husband bought it new for me in 2004.  I have just hit 401,000 miles.  It still has the original engine, but the transmission was replaced about 200k miles.  Regular maintenance and an exceptional service department have given this girl of mine the longevity she deserves!!  A lot of history and many miles on the road together have made this purchase over 12 years ago a wonderful gift. My next car will be an Acura, likely an RDX, as the new MDX is way out of my price point, and nearly matches what I spent on my first house. I would and have on numbers of occasions, without hesitation recommend buying an Acura to anyone who will listen.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Tabasco, 10/02/2003,It's the best SUV,pos,"This is the best SUV on the market. Here are 
my only complaints: The switch for the 
sunroof is located to the left of the drivers 
wheel. Passenger can not control the sunroof. 
The other annoying thing is the clock, located 
on the radio which most times is not readable. 
They should either locate it in the instrument 
cluster or make it bright so I don't need 
glasses to see the time. It would be nice to 
make a time button on the Navigation screen."
acura,mdx,2004,lgq2001, 09/11/2014,A great SUV,pos,Got it at 160k. It ran and drove very well. Now it has 190k. No any problems and still runs like new. I really like it. 
acura,mdx,2004,Terry, 08/13/2010,"2004 MDX reliable after 100,000",pos,"I have had my car for 4 years and reached 100,000 miles on it and still a great car to drive and dependable. Only changing the oil and brake pads. No problems with maintenance. This car is amazing while in town or traveling on vacation on the highway. Its an All Weather car also. Forget Toyota or Nissan, Acura has definitely made a quality car to last a long time."
acura,mdx,2004,Costa, 02/21/2016,Just hit 170k miles and very reliable,pos,"I bought this as a third vehicle (instead of a work truck for my rental properties) with about 160k miles.  I have owned it for a little over a year and it just hit 170k miles with no major problems.  The original owner maintained it well for it's first 160k miles, as have I for the last 10k miles.  I do have to replace the power steering pump soon, the loud whine that seems to be a common problem, but otherwise no problems.  I have never owned a car with mileage this high so I have no basis for comparison but I am very happy with the reliability.  

It also drives great and if the odometer said 50k miles I would believe it.  The navigation system seems very modern for a 12 year old car and the leather is in like new condition.  We have an Infiniti JX35 with 50k miles and the drivers seat is already more worn than this MDX with 170k miles; they must have used a very high quality/durable leather.  

The only downsides are no blue tooth in the 2004, I believe 2005 models have blue tooth, and the interior is small for a 3 row SUV (trade off for handling well for a 3 row SUV).

acura,mdx,2004,TT Smith, 12/10/2016,Pleased,pos,"I spent a significant amount of time preparing for and shopping for a used vehicle as a primary vehicle. My previous vehicle was dying and I needed a replacement. Highlander, Lexus 330, Traverse ... but once I drove the MDX, I knew that a 2007 or 8 was what I was looking for ... Then I found this 2004 with only 88K miles and 'imported' from San Diego to Denver area. What a bulletproof beast she has been for the last year. Pretty heavy travel year, and I'm now at 112K with only great performance. Little bit more money into it after the purchase than I anticipated: timing belt, 105K maintenance, 2 motor mounts, new tires, new leather on the passenger side. But, I love the 3.5, the ride and the performance in the snow ... and great road trip vehicle for 1,000+ mile trips. Probably, the best vehicle I've ever owned -- we'll see. Basically, looks brand new so I expect that I'll get 5-10 years out of it. I agree with all of the positives listed on these reviews. Like the previous Lady's review, if it lasts that long, I'd be happy to keep it to 400K, I feel.

UPDATE 6/20/17:  By the time the 4th of July Holiday is over, I will have put over 40K miles on this 2004 MDX during my 18 months of ownership. I'm happy. Other than the above, the only other things I've handled on this vehicle is having the worn out leather redone on the drivers side.  Change the oil every 5K (uses about a quart), rotate the tires and get it aligned on the unlimited package at Sears. When I get to 150K I'll have the front end redone and replace the sway bar (about $1100). Otherwise, I expect she'll just keep going. Great road-trip vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Sunil, 10/30/2017,Beast that puts latest SUVs to Shame,pos,"I recently moved to US and this is first car I bought based on overall reviews of used SUVs. I bought it at 131K and had no idea what to look out while buying a used car which costed me heavy since its all maintenance were pending. I spent over 4100 Buying 4 new Tyre, Timing Belt, replacing whole Power steering kit, front sway bars, rear shockers, driver side passenger door motor+regulator kit, front axles. The Car runs like beast, I haven't traveled very long distances but my last 500+ mile trip was great. Power is available when I want, it accelerates when I want, even after driving it 3-4 hours continuously, don't feel tired. While It was given for fix, I was offered Equinox and Nissan Rogue for driving and I'm not getting into those SUVs again. I tried couple of more SUVs and they felt like plastic boxes. Having spent so much, My Mechanic says this Car is now good for another 60K mile without any mechincal or transmission issues. I asked him how long can I drive it and he said it will easily go 300K + miles.

acura,mdx,2004,Corrinne, 09/23/2018,265k and going strong,pos,"This vehicle lasts! I have 265k miles and still going strong.  Diver seat has torn and there is some sort of leak that causes front floor/carpets to be wet every time the road is wet.  Not coming from the top down , as it can happen when the roads are wet without it raining.  The capacity is tremendous!  I use it to move furniture for my staiging business and can haul sofas in the back with the 3rd row seats laid flat.  I also drive real estate clients around in the winter and it has gotten us in and out of some dicey road and snow conditions.  Luxury and toughness combined - I love this MDX!  Has been my primary vehicle for 11 years now!
"
acura,mdx,2004,lgq2001, 09/09/2014,I really enjoy it,pos,"Get it from a small dealer with 165k mile on it. It runs and drives always great with such a high mile. Now, it has about 190k, no any problems. really like it. The best SUV on the road. "
acura,mdx,2004,Tong Chang, 01/27/2016,BEST BANGS FOR THE BUCKS,pos,"I have 335,000 miles on this car. Still going strong with original motor. Only changed out the Alternator, Belts, and struts/shock. Proper maintenance will this car will give you many years.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Joe C., 04/24/2010,Affordable luxury SUV,pos,"Driven over 112k in less than 6 years. No mechanical problems. Drives very smooth and still handles/feels like a new vehicle after so long. Some cosmetic problems here and there. Sales person pressured to buy extended warranty, but it is waste of money. Overall a reliable and affordable luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2004,Alex, 06/08/2010,Great car but some repairs required,pos,"Overall this is a great car, got it back in 2004 brand new, traded up from the Maxima, MDX handles excellently in bad weather, awesome traction. Great room in the back for the kids. I have 90,000 and it started requiring maintenance, so far replaced 2 engine mounts and will be replacing the 3rd one very soon along with the inner tie rod, the rear shocks had to be replaced at 30k. Funny enough I don't do any off road driving or towing, just regular city commute. We'll still keep the car for another 10k and probably trade it for something else. "
acura,mdx,2004,tfmeisen, 09/29/2009,Nice Vehicle,pos,"I decided that I wanted a luxury SUV. I drove several different types and I believe that the Acura MDX is one of the best vehicles for your money on the market today.  It has the size, and space of an SUV, but rides like a luxury car.  The interior is plush and the features are great and easy to use.  I had every option except for the navigation and DVD player.  It had plenty of power and still got good gas mileage, on a long trip I could get over 22 mpg which is incredible considering the size.  The only problems I had: the cruise control broke, and I somehow broke the front motor mount and it was expensive.  The other downside is the vehicle has to be serviced by Acura for most things."
acura,mdx,2004,rowemowe, 07/31/2004,Try something else,pos,"Don't make the same mistake I did.

Research this vehicle before you buy.  
Do a search on Google or Yahoo for ""MDX 
Noise"" and you'll see that there is a 
cronic problem with brake and gas tank 
noise that is called ""normal"" by the 
manufacturer.  

When you test drive the vehicle, make 
sure you keep the radio off and have a 
nearly full tank of gas.  Let the car 
idle forward and hit the brake.  If you 
can live with the sounds of gas 
sloshing around and the back brake 
thud, then you won't mind spending 35K -
40K.

Also, take a look at all of the 
Technical Service Bulletins issued by 
Acura on this vehicle.  You can find 
them at the NHTSA website."
acura,mdx,2004,carmin ator, 07/15/2005,It's the ultimate driver's machine,pos,"The MDX is the ultimate driver's machine. The ""ultimate driving machine"" might be good for short hops from the mansion to the golf course. But the MDX is perfect for hauling 6 humans and luggage for a 10 day road-trip. Handling is crisp and taut. Interior room is adequate for 6 - if you put the kids in the last row. The convenience package is adequate neither underwhelming nor overwhelming. The safety features crumple zones, breakaway mounts, full curtain side airbags, etc. are uptodate. Mileage was a paltry 12-13mpg street and 20-25 hwy. For absolute comfort buy the Navigator; for raw power buy the X5. But if you're on a budget and want an all-round SUV that's awesome to drive buy the MDX."
acura,mdx,2004,Midlifemom, 10/08/2007,Excellent car to own and drive,pos,"I drive 40K a year.  Perfect vehicle.  Decent mileage (20.5 on highway).  Will not tip like Sequoia, 4Runner.  Excellent in rain, snow.  Excellent sound.  Very perfect vision all around for driving safety.  Good in curves, swerving.  Mirrors great, melt snow.  Tows my boat great, out of steep ramps.  Windshield banked so no chips from rocks.  Fog lights catch deer on dark highway at night for you, safer.  Passes fine.  Pick up fine.  Looks pretty.  Never, never, never screws up.  Have never had to have it fixed.  I have 113,000 miles.  Very fine car, recommend it.  Others I have had are Yukon, Sequoia, Mercedes, Volvo.  "
acura,mdx,2004,tedelco, 02/06/2004,Bad Humming Noise,pos,"I have owned a 2004 Acura MDX SUV for 
about two months. This car has caused 
me many problems. When I drive at an 
engine speed of 2000 RPMS I can hear 
an annoying, constant humming noise. 
The Acura dealer has checked it a 
number of times and tell me it is 
normal and cannot do anything about 
it. I have also contacted the Acura 
Manufacturer and they have given me 
the same reply. I do not know what 
else I can do.
To all future 2004 Acura MDX SUV 
costumers: when you take a test drive 
for this car, make sure to listen for 
this noise when the engine speed 
reaches about 2000 RPMS. Thank you."
acura,mdx,2004,Michael, 12/14/2018,DONT BUY!! READ MY REVIEW,neg,"I bought a used mdx 2004. I thought if I had to buy an older vehicle Acura would be the way to go. Boy was I wrong. I've had it 2 months and now going on my third YES I SAID 3RD transmission in this piece of absolute JUNK ! The navigation doesn't work, Acura wants big money to fix it, heated seat no,longer works. Acura KNOWS ABOUT THEIR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND DO NOTHING TO HELP THE OWNERS OF THEIR JUNK VEHICLES. Do NOT BUY AND MDX OF ANY YEAR.

acura,mdx,2004,jms112997, 02/08/2010,"185,000 Miles and still going strong!",pos,"I've owned just about everything, this is the best vehicle I have owned.  I still get about 19mpg mixed approaching 200k miles.  Ordered it new, all options.  Followed all major services thus far.  There are not many vehicles out there that can go 2 car seats and a booster wide, have great cargo capacity, handles like a sedan, AWD (fantastic in the Michigan snow), and get great gas mileage, oh and the reliability: I've replaced one light bulb, one tail lightbulb and thats it.  It has been in 3 different small accidents and just keeps going.  Highly recommend anything honda/acura. "
acura,mdx,2004,rlb30, 11/03/2003,Solid SUV,pos,"Great, solid vehicle. Comfortable on a 
long trip, wide stance gives a very 
stable ride, bigger inside than it 
looks.  Lot's of power.  Don't know 
about the lackluster interior comments 
from some reviewers, but it is 
functional and fine with me.  

Only complaint I have is the gearshift 
could be better designed and easier to 
move between gears.  Not as ""off road"" 
as my Jeep, but it doesn't claim to 
be.  Also, I wouldn't buy it if I had 
to use it to tow much weight."
acura,mdx,2004,Baltimore Owner, 06/14/2005,Pretty Good - but NOT perfect !,pos,"Bought in Nov 2004 as leftover - got excellent deal (below invoice).  Vehicle has had several problems since then: 1.  Tire(s):  Touring was supposed to have Michelin ONE of the 4 tires was a GOODYEAR !! (dealer fixed) 2.  Despite VERY VERY gentle driving, developed shimmy at 7k miles and had brake rotors cut (dealer fixed) 3. Interior speaker cover fell off spontaneously (dealer fixed) 4.  Headliner rattles VERY loudly on left side when going over large bumps or RR tracks - Dealer could NOT fix .."
acura,mdx,2004,LoopyL10, 11/16/2004,I LOVE this car!,pos,"After driving a Ford Explorer for 6 
years, I think I died and went to 
heaven once we purchased the MDX! A 
smooth, comfortable ride, good gas 
mileage for its size and plenty of 
room. Great power, a fun car to drive 
and own. I highly recommend over the 
Volvo, you won't regret this purchase! 
If you are considering the Pilot try 
spurging on the MDX; a much more 
luxurious, better riding SUV.    "
acura,mdx,2004,kevman1, 01/26/2007,I'd buy another X,pos,"This has been the perfect vehicle for me because: 1. I drive 45 miles to work, so the 25 mpg I get (driving gently) is great. 2. I can fit anything I need to inside, since it can accommodate boards/items 4' wide. 3. I love the way it looks. 4. It was cheaper than all the other SUVs I was looking at. 5. I've had NO major issues with it for 78k miles. 6. I can perform my own maintenance (all 4 fluid changes)."
acura,mdx,2004,crazyhutch, 12/28/2003,Love the MDX!!!,pos,"Awesome from top to bottom.  The

the DVD is great for traveling with 
kids.  Great gas mileage, features, and 
design."
acura,mdx,2004,Ken, 03/13/2009,Honda is Plastically Challanged!,pos,"Pretty nice overall, aside from the front air vent falling off in my hand and the rear speaker covers can be easily pried off without tools.  The whole interior is bland and it drives like the Queen Mary II."
acura,mdx,2004,Steve Jones, 09/04/2009,Don't buy,neg,"This vehicle has been the most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned.  In the last 5 months, I have spent over a $1000 on the transmission (torque converter and another switch) and another $700 on the power steering (a loud whine).  Both of these problems have numerous complaints against them, but Acura won't do anything since it's not under warranty.  There are service bulletins out for these issues, but Acura won't do anything until forced to by a recall."
acura,mdx,2004,sro100, 01/06/2005,Great,pos,We love the MDX. Highly recommended. 
acura,mdx,2004,Thorstein36, 10/03/2003,Too Nice to Believe!,pos,"I feel totally secure when driving in 
the worst weather--this MDX is a dream

touch of luxury, and is absolutely 
reliable."
acura,mdx,2004,Karicher, 10/09/2003,Rpleaced our Explorer,pos,"Safe and fun to drive.  Purchased due 
to reliability, safety ratings, 
traction and stability control 
systems.  Plenty of interior room 
while not looking as big from outside."
acura,mdx,2004,dscott, 02/03/2005,Crash tested with flying colors,pos,"I love my MDX - it makes me feel really safe when I drive it.  I'd had it 3 months with 4K miles when another driver crossed the median and hit me head on (he was uninsured, but that's another story).  All the airbags deployed -  front, side curtain, passenger.  Other than a slightly burned hand from the deploying airbags, and the accompanying muscle aches and pains, I walked away in one piece.  All the safety features, including the airbags, did their thing, absorbing the impact. My next vehicle will definitely be another MDX.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Joanne Melanson, 11/04/2003,It is OK,pos,"Design flaw in retractable front seat 
belts causes the belts to snap back 
too quickly and hit the door jamb.  
The result is small nicks on the door 
casing that will only get worse as the 
car ages.   Tape over the area  helps 
diminish this problem.  Fuel economy 
is not good on local travel but ok on 
highway.  Third seat is useless."
acura,mdx,2004,mysimonj, 11/10/2003,Pretty darn good,pos,"Just got a 2004 Touring RES/Nav 'cause 
I needed more space for the baby and 
cargo space to carry more than a golf 
bag in my bimmer.  I knew that Acura 
always had a good reputation for 
overall refinement and quality and 
this vehicle does meet my 
expectations.  Very smooth engine 
which is surprisingly quick, its cargo 
space is monstrous; ottoman, weber 
grill, you name it-it fits.  Third row 
seating is practical for my minisized 
friends.  Excellent vehicle with such 
practicality, truly an ""UTILITY"" 
vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,DocDad, 12/06/2003,"Classy, practical, and worry free",pos,"This is a wonderful vehicle.  I'd buy 
it over and over again. It's nice 
enough to make me feel special, and to 
make others jealous.  It handles well 
with good power, and the ride is 
smooth without being floaty. All the 
little things (seat warmers, cup 
holders, seat position controls, side 
mirror heaters) are functional, solid, 
and well thought-out.  Great for 
driving alone or with a carload of 
kids.  I bought the base model and 
custom installed a DVD player for the 
back, costing much less than getting 
the Touring model with its DVD 
option.  The climate controls are a 
little hard to figure out, but work 
well. "
acura,mdx,2004,Walter_NH, 12/07/2003,Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"Had a Jeep Grand Cherokee for 9 
years.  After looking at the 
flexability, performance, winter 
driving and reliability of Lexus, BMW, 
Volvo, Infinity, Nisson, VW,Toyota and 
Acura; there was really only one 
choice - the ACURA MDX.  A test drove 
all the SUV's and read information for 
two months before making the final 
pick.  I paid $36,500 ($400 under 
invoice).  It was the base model.  For 
an extra $4,000 to $6,000 I could have 
got some nice extras (NAV, DVD, Sound 
system, etc.) but decided the base 
model was a great deal.  We just had 
our first big snow storm in New 
England 15"" to 30"" and the MDX was 
perfect, I mean just great in the snow 
and sleet ! "
acura,mdx,2004,Paclark11, 02/11/2004,Ultimate Performer,pos,"This SUV is awesome. I really do not 
understand the complaints about gas 
mileage. I live in the DC Metro Area, 
and I average 18.5 - 19.6 miles per 
gallon CITY, and 25.4 - 26.7 HIGHWAY.  
The MDX is hands down the best luxury 
SUV under $45,000 sticker. Remember 
follow the break in period per the 
owners manual and the gas mileage will 
increase guaranteed."

acura,mdx,2004,snaser, 05/20/2006,Great SUV,pos,"The Accura MDX is a great SUV for the family & fun to drive alone. It is the perfect size & height...not too big. The lines are sexy and sleek, I love the heated seats (which I use all year round). It is comfortable and dependable."

Actually recieved higher mileage than 
any tank in prior SUV and longer range 
than prior vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,TJP, 06/17/2005,"Perfect, but no Hybrid",pos,"We're had our Premium model for almost a year, and we've thoroughly enjoyed it to date.  No problems, as you'd expect from a Honda product, excellent comfort and room, and decent power.  Fuel economy never has been above 19 mpg, however, despite highway only jaunts.  Admittedly, these have been at high speeds (75-80 mph), at which drag would be substantial for a vehicle this size.  If we wanted maximum fuel economy, we'd have gotten a Jetta diesel with a trailer for our stuff.  For our needs, the MDX has been perfect"
acura,mdx,2004,lvernacc, 06/19/2005,I Love My MDX,pos,"I purchased my MDX a year ago after researching and test driving all comparable SUV's.  I chose the MDX for the roominess, feel and gas mileage.  By far this vehicle handles better than any other in it's class.  There is plenty of leg room in all three rows and comes standard with front and side airbags.  I would recommend this car to everyone.  It comes in handy for traveling with children and teenagers."

I have an ACURA Legend that has remained reliable with over 180k on it. That helped convince me to stick with ACURA in the SUV department. The MDX feels sturdy, and drive very nicely.  You have a commanding feel behind the wheel, and good visibility.  The navigation system is awesome. It is more than just an expensive toy. It will give you the confidence to venture into unknown territory without trepidation.  I once drove an hour down back roads that didn't show on most maps, and I didn't have a clue as to where I was, or how to get out.  Then I used the nav, and it guided me precisely and ACURA-tely back to main roads, and home."

have an icon that idicated when the 
tire pressure it low. Though, keep in 
mind just because the pressure is low 
doesnt mean there is a nail in the

say is the camera which comes on the

It is very reliable, because it is built by Honda, otherwise it is horrible. The seats are hard and get VERY uncomfortable on trips. It is very big, not smooth, and needs a better turing radius. It also gets horrible gas mileage, about 16 mpg. I have driven my sisters RX330 and found it is very comforatable and feels like you are driving on a cloud.Plus it has a great turning radius, and the service is great! It also gets 25mpg. Dont buy the MDX, it you want performance and dependable luxury, go to Lexus. I cant wait for my lease to end, to purchase the RX330"
acura,mdx,2004,Jon R, 07/20/2009,Reliable and Comfortable,pos,"I bought this car used with 19K mi in 10/2005.  I now have 56K mi.  The car is extremely reliable and very comfortable.  It handles nicely and it is no surprise that you still see so many late MDX's still on the road and still in great shape.  For all of the features that you get on this car, it really is a great value.  The cars are not cheap, but you get a lot of standard options in these cars that would drive the price up on other comparable models from other brands.  Also, the car doesn't seem very big, but my wife and I are amazed at how much room you have inside.  They did a great job using the space.  It is a great family car and would consider getting a new one."

It was $8,000.00 less than a Lexus GX470 & the BMW X5. Seats are extremely confortable and the navigation system is user friendly. a joy to drive everyday. The dealer options available really dress this vehicle up."
acura,mdx,2004,hzbbgl, 10/14/2003,Smooth drivng SUV,pos,"The Acura MDX is a fun to drive, it 
rides so smooth its like driving a 
smooth riding car. You don't feel like 
your driving a SUV becauses it low to 
the ground.  The interior design is 
great, it even has a camera on the tail 
so when you are in reverse the screen 
were the navigator system is will show 
you what is behind.  It has a voice 
activiated system for the navigator so 
you don't have to push any bottoms when 
you need driving directions.  It has 
room for 7. It's worth the price."
acura,mdx,2004,Zoeyleigh, 11/01/2003,Perfect SUV,pos,"Love this car! Great to drive, hugs the 
road well. Roomy enough inside for 
kids,dogs and luggage. Fun to drive and 
sporty looking."
acura,mdx,2004,alibclan, 11/11/2003,smooth ride,pos,"this vehicle handles great. at 80 mph 
it feels like it is travelling 55. 
tight around corners for an suv. it is 
also very comfortable inside, has lots 
of room and a very good sound system."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXer, 11/13/2003,Only Gets Better,pos,"I traded my 2001 MDX in for the 2004.  
What a difference 3 years makes.  The 
MDX drives better, is faster, more 
responsive and more comfortable then 
the 2001.  The kids love the 
entertainment system."
acura,mdx,2004,snobny, 11/19/2003,Bad Start,pos,"After buying my car on Saturday night, 
Monday afternoon I was going home from 
work when my car wouldn't start. I 
ended up haveing it towed to the 
nearest Acura dealership. This is my 
second MDX and never had a problem with 
my first one. I ended up haveing a new 
navigation system, a whole new computer 
and ect. put in my car after 300 miles. 
Acura did take care of me by giving me 
a car to drive in the mean time, but it 
just wasn't the same. Now, everythings 
okay just got off to a bad start."
acura,mdx,2004,susieqz, 11/18/2003,Awsome Car!,pos,"This car has got to be the best I have 
ever owned.  I love everything about 
it.  It drives like a dream.  The sound 
system is great.  The cabin is quiet.  
The seats are comfortable.  It does 
just as advertised on gas mileage--even 
when using less than premium.  It has 
every gadget I could ever want. "
acura,mdx,2004,mchen007, 11/24/2003,King of the hill.,pos,"The best SUV on the market.  This is 
our second MDX in the family.  We laso 
have a 2002 MDX Tour & Nav and was 
extremely happy.  That's why we went 
out and got another one.  We purchased 
the 2004 MDX tour, nav, and dvd ent in 
aspen pearl white.  Amazingly, 
honda/acura managed to improve on 
previous models with more power, 
smoother ride, better handling, and 
sportier design.  And the numerous toys 
to play with inside amaze me.  Great 
suv!!  They managed to squeeze four 
disc players into the suv (Nav DVD 
player, 6 disc cd changer, single disc 
in dash cd player, and DVD movie 
player... Awesome. Oh yeah, rear view 
camera is cool too."
acura,mdx,2004,shannon williams, 11/29/2003,I love my MDX,pos,"The MDX is an excellent SUV.  The rear 
view camera is great for me when 
parking and the Navigation system is so 
easy to understand and use.  The MDX 
gives you a comfortable ride, with 
seating capacity of seven adults, 
thanks to third row seat.  The sound 
system is very enjoyable.  My only 
regret now is that I did not get the 
DVD Entertainment System."
acura,mdx,2004,bigJoe, 11/19/2003,2004 Acura MDX Fast & Fun,pos,"  The Acura with Mitsu tires drives 
like a dream.  The unit is quiet, 
starts and accelerates very quickly 
and smoothly.  I liked the fact that 
it's the only SUV with the governments 
ultra clean engine certification.  The 
other thing I like about acura is 
there's only a few options.. most 
eveything is standard. Dual exhaust 
looks sharp I got the optional side 
boards for an added touch. excellent 
paint and fit and a standard sunroof 
are a plus. Front wheel drive with 
auto 4 wheel makes it sure footed in 
slipery weather."
acura,mdx,2004,jehmd, 11/20/2003,almost perfect,pos,"Everything is great with my 04 mdx 
except one annoying problem. Excessive 
muffler noise @ low RPM."
acura,mdx,2004,Acura Lover, 11/22/2003,The Greatest SUV I've Ever Owned,pos,"Better than the X5 I used to own.  
We're planning to get a second one 
when my wife's Volvo X70 lease is up.  
The kid's love the room and enjoy the 
option of having their own row with 
the seven passenger seating. The 
performance and handling on the MDX is 
like a fine performance car.  The four 
wheel drive is seemless and the gas 
mileage blows my former X5 away.
I had to wait for the MDX since it's 
the most popular SUV in it's class, 
but trust me, it's so worth it.  
Dollar for dollar, you just can't beat 
it.  It has features that come 
standard that the X5 just couldn't 
touch. If you're in NJ, definitely go 
to DCH Montclair Acura."
acura,mdx,2004,Blades, 11/23/2003,Best SUV in class,pos,"This is the best SUV on the market, 
feature for feature, dollar for 
dollar!  There are more expensive 
SUV's!  SUV's with more snob appeal, 
but that don't feed the Bulldog!  They 
cannot carry hardly anything 
internally or compare with the Honda's 
ULEV motor!  I would not trade mine 
which I use as a commercial vehicle 
for any other SUV on the market!"
acura,mdx,2004,ovation00, 12/05/2003,2004 MDX w/ Nav,pos,"It's been about 3 wks since I pick up 
my 04 mdx. The engine has just broken 
in and I started pushing it more. This 
vehicle drives, handles quite well and 
is quite. I like the easy-to-use 
buttons and simple interior. It looks 
wonderful with satin finish side step, 
rear spoiler, and wide side moldings. 
There are a couple of glitches to be 
fixed such as faulty tire pressure 
light (TPMS) and low clicking sound 
from the break pedal."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXFAN, 12/06/2003,5 scouts,pos,"Comfort and fun.  Taking 54 scouts and 
gear can be a tough.  The MDX with the 
Nav and entertainment keeps everyone 
occupied. I added a Thule gear box for 
snowboards, tents, skis etc.  Gas 
milege is better than expected.  
Averages 20 MPG, goes anywhere offroad 
I need to go.  "
acura,mdx,2004,MDX04, 12/11/2003,2004 MDX - Love it,pos,"Only problem was noise from the nash 
after 100 miles.  Dealer found problem 
and fixed it right away.   Great ride, 
feels like a car.  Fuel economy is less 
than with a car, but that is expected 
when purchasing an SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2004,david94134, 12/12/2003,2004 Acura MDX review,pos,Excellent SUV and best in its class.
acura,mdx,2004,minnie, 07/08/2005,Couldn't ask for more.,pos,"Good acceleration, extremely stable handling, slightly less poorer milage than expected, excellent fit and finish.  This car has been extremely reliable and has amazing safety statistics."
acura,mdx,2004,nll, 12/15/2003,The interior should be higher qlty.,pos,"I have enjoyed owning and driving this 
car. It's a great vehicle. My 
disappointments are in the suggested 
improvements section. Paying sticker 
was painful. The gas mileage could be 
better. I get 17/mpg. Defrost gives 
off a musty smell in summer."
acura,mdx,2004,Rizwan Malik, 12/21/2003,Simply awesome.....,pos,"  I bought MDX yesterday and it is 
simply awesome with tons of safety 
features, state of the art gadgets and 
a silky smooth engine. Plenty of room 
and an axcellent DVD and Navigation 
system. I feel this SUV is much better 
than the lexus GX470, BMW X5, VW 
Touareg and Mercedes ML, as I test 
drove all of them in one day and Acura 
was the winner...well done Acura!"
acura,mdx,2004,rtcxyz, 12/24/2003,Great Car,pos,"Extremely well designed. Excellent 
build quality. Classy and functional 
interior. Accelerates and corners 
beautifully, rides great. We evaluated 
the Lexus RX330, BMW X5, Volvo XC90 but 
the MDX was the clear choice. Only bad 
news is due to high demand/quality, the 
dealers aren't willing to negotiate 
from MSRP. At least they are no longer 
adding a premium over MSRP."
acura,mdx,2004,bengt, 12/27/2003,I looked for safety and comfort,pos,"Safety was the pime component as I 
shopped for a new SUV.  The MDX has the 
safety features I was looking for. I 
was also looking for comfort, style and 
a navigation system. I looked at other 
brands, but the MDX was the one which 
met my needs.  Other luxury brands in 
this size car didn't offer the third 
seat; they also had smaller cargo 
areas.  The navigation system is a 
fantastic addition; the rear camera 
used when the car is in reverse, is 
also a great feature.  I love the car!"
acura,mdx,2004,Bharat, 12/27/2003,a good vehicle,pos,Love it. No Regrets.
acura,mdx,2004,mamardo, 12/27/2003,we love this car,pos,"We have just purchased this vehicle, 
but love the way it rides, looks and 
reacts to your every move. The interior 
is very luxious and comfortable and has 
so many wonderful features. It is great 
to travel with children or dogs as each 
seat has comfort and spacious. I would 
reccomned it highly!"
acura,mdx,2004,Kadepp, 12/27/2003,I love my Acura MDX,pos,"I LOVE MY CAR! I drive 1.5 hours to 
work and again back home -- at the end 
of the day I am disappointed when it is 
time to pull into the garage because 
the ride has been so great and I am not 
dog tired from sitting in the driver's 
seat until 7 pm."
acura,mdx,2004,quicksale, 12/27/2003,Fantastic!,pos,"With the NAV System, the Acura MDX is 
incredible.  A Great SUV!"
acura,mdx,2004,Bob A, 12/27/2003,Great SUV,pos,Rides as good as  my Lincoln.
acura,mdx,2004,Kevin Roberson, 12/29/2003,Our MDX,pos,"Great SUV. Overall best SUV for the 
money. We like it even better than out 
Lexus lx470"
acura,mdx,2004,Tofer, 12/29/2003,Awesome Luxury SUV,pos,"We looked at 5 other SUV's before we 
settled on the MDX, including the BMW, 
VW Touareg, Highlander, Pilot and the 
Lexus RX330.  In the end we picked the 
MDX for the best combination of luxury, 
ride, and price.  The MDX offers a very 
quiet ride - but is still very 
responsive and a lot of fun to drive. 
The styling is in our opinion the 
best.  The interior is very well laid 
out and we found this to be the most 
comforable of all the SUV's we drove.  
While we won't use the 3rd row seats 
very often, it is nice to have the 
extra seating available."
acura,mdx,2004,BAV, 12/30/2003,Great so far,pos,"Purchased Sage Brush Pearl w/ touring 
package 11/03, only 500+ miles so far.  
Ride and handling are great.  Also test 
drove Murano and it was more fun/sporty 
but felt MDX was more solid, much nicer 
interior, and proven long-term 
reliability, and 2004 changes were 
right on (side curtain air bags, slight 
body modifications, interior display).  
Also thought about 4runner but 
preferred MDX compromise of eco-
friendly V6, great cargo and seating 
space, luxury options, and safety. "
acura,mdx,2004,rizwan malik, 01/03/2004,awesome!,pos,"i bought it few weeks ago and this is 
an awesome SUV, much beter than the 
Lexus GX470,volvo XC90,BMW X5 or 
mercedes ML500. well built and an 
excelent ride quality. very smooth and 
powerful"
acura,mdx,2004,my, 01/03/2004,nice SUV with bland style,pos,"very good SUV overall in terms of 
reliability, but style is bland and not 
exciting.   "
acura,mdx,2004,dlewin, 01/04/2004,Best SUV for the $,pos,"Our '04 has about 1000 miles on it now 
and it's been great.  The ride is as 
quiet and smooth as most luxury sedans 
and the handling is better than most 
SUV's I've driven.  Build quality is 
very high as well.  The DVD is great 
for the kids - we can go for hours 
without a single tantrum!  And the Nav 
has proven more useful than we expected 
as we have used it to quickly find 
restaurants and tourist attractions.  I 
really wouldn't change much anout this 
SUV!"
acura,mdx,2004,sunshineks, 01/10/2004,Best Car I Ever Drove,pos,"My Acura MDX is the most comfortable 
and easy driving car I have ever had.  
I do alot of highway driving and the 
MDX almost drives itself.  It is very 
quiet and smooth.  I will never go back 
to driving a smaller car again."
acura,mdx,2004,DonMclRPI, 01/11/2004,Lots to like; easy to be with.,pos,"This is by far the most comfortable 
vehicle I have ever driven. Everything 
manages to be in the right place to 
find it and the little features of 
automation really work to make the 
driving pleasant.

The heating system, while short of all 
the buttons, knobs and zones of some 
others, simply works. I (we) seldome 
change any setting, save the back seat 
control to allow passengers their say

The second seats are the surprise.... 
they recline.

Backing up with the camera is 
surprising. Try it in a pitch dark 
situation to really surprise yourself.

And, six though it is, it goes!

My advice .... drive this ""bland"" SUV a 
few miles before you buy anything else. "
acura,mdx,2004,BacktoAcura, 01/12/2004,BacktoAcura,pos,"Drove SUVs for years. Wanted a 
more ""car-like"" & better refinement.
Drove Infiniti FX...RX 330...Hylander
MDX was the best value & refinement for
the $$. Turned in my QX4...tired of the
bumpy ride & cramped quarters. MDX
superior ride...engine...interior..etc.
Acura's quality & in my case...""Welcome

was refreshing!"
acura,mdx,2004,MDXDriver, 01/13/2004,MDX,pos,"Great, realiable, comfortable car, no

very responsibly. I might've enjoyed a

altogether, the MDX indeed is a 
luxurious SUV."

acura,mdx,2004,annalisa, 01/24/2004,04baseMDX-SO HAPPY I OWN ONE,pos,"I've been eyeing this vehicle for
several months and did a lot of
research. dealerships were competitive
but got the best deal at 35,300 with
side steps!-excl.tax and license. love
the vehicle and look forward to driving
it all the time. i just wish gas
consumption was a lot better even though
that's a given with an suv."
acura,mdx,2004,redwaller, 01/26/2004,MDX,pos,"One year and 9000 miles have been
reasonable, I find that there is more
than usual hunting for gears(between 4th
and 5th)even on mildly slopy roads.
(2) Our dealership services are shameful
they use recycled engine oil that too
not the recommended SAE 5-20 but 5-30.
For next simple oil change I will try DIY. "

acura,mdx,2004,DebbieM, 01/21/2004,Love my MDX!,pos,"I am not a car enthusiasist, but I love 
the MDX!  Drove it 1600 miles shortly 
after getting it & it performed well & 
was very comfortable (even for my 6'5"" 
husband who hates cramped spaces).  I 
like it too because although it is 
attractive -- it isn't showy.  We've 
never owned an Acura before, but I 
suspect this is not our last one!  (PS -
our golden retriver loves any vehicle, 
but our little ""uppity"" dogs even love 
it!)"
acura,mdx,2004,PC MDX, 12/29/2005,2 Years of Flawless Ownership,pos,"I have to admit. This is my first SUV, and it is the best on the market by far. I have had no issues, no complaints, and dealer service as been good as well. Buyers of SUV's should evaluate before purchasing, since it took me 3 months to decide between the Lexus RX, the MDX, and the Pilot. The MDX has the best overall performance, features, turning radius and off road ability as comparable to the Pilot. If a person would like to have simple styling, then go with the Pilot. Better exterior styling then go with the MDX, which was the deciding factor for me. "
acura,mdx,2004,foodie, 01/31/2004,Fab SUV,pos,"My new MDX is the most wonderful car.  
I enjoy it more then any other car I

is safe, reliable, beautiful and 
handles like a dream."
acura,mdx,2004,Strong, 01/31/2004,MDX,pos,"Best vechicle I have ever owned. 
Pleasant to drive, good visability. The 
Nav system is wonderful - never ben 
lost since I have satrted using it. "
acura,mdx,2004,GMZ, 01/03/2006,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"We purchased our 2004 MDX w/touring new for 41 grand(about $900 under MSRP). It has been a wonderful vehicle, with a powerful engine, a spacious, functional, and quality built interior. It is very family friendly, with a complaint ride and many cupholders and storage areas. The driving dynamics are also impressive, with balanced steering (though not X5 level) and sporty handling. I have just 1 problem with the MDX. It's interior may be high quality, but lacks some of the classy-look of the BMW X5. The AWD will make for a sure friend, and the MDX handles much better on snow than Lexus RX330. Throw in a bargain price, and it's easily a better buy than the X5, RX, or Pilot which I test drove."
acura,mdx,2004,Nice Vehicle, 01/06/2006,Great Vehicle,pos,"Very satisfied owner after 18 months.  Great combination of utility, quality, performance, and reliability.  Recently completed a long holiday trip in inclement weather, which highlighted this vehicle's value proposition---car handled great, giving the driver (me) reassuring confidence, while four other family members stretched out comfortably to snooze, leaving room to spare for holiday luggage/gifts.  No regrets thus far on this purchase.    "
acura,mdx,2004,fred, 01/22/2006,2004 acura mdx,pos,"The MDX is exactly what it purports to be, an extremely reliable, attractive, solid SUV with a well laid out, good looking interior and exterior, good handling, a wonderful driving feel, a first rate navigation system and mediocre gas mileage (but it's an SUV so what did you expect!)  I'd buy another, although I'm particularly interested in the new, smaller Acura SUV promised for later this year - so long as it's not too small.  Typical Honda quality."
acura,mdx,2004,Andyrew, 02/16/2004,Its excellent,pos,"I have a 2003 MDX it is ecxellent. I 
love it very much, and i am happy with 
it. Although after a while sitting on 
it it isnt so comfortable. And if your 
haul around all of the seven it can fit 
its not so comfortable."
acura,mdx,2004,EVP, 02/16/2004,THE BEST,pos,"THIS IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED

BETTER THAN THE CADDY.
GREAT PICK UP,ACCELERATION AND HANDLES 
LIKE A SPORTS CAR."
acura,mdx,2004,Abigail, 02/18/2004,Acura Review,pos,"Overall handling/comfort is great. Rear 
(3rd row) seat is more for kids or 
cargo and not made for adults. Highway 
accelaration noise is a bit excessive 
and annoying, just boost up the 
dynamite sound system to drown it out."
acura,mdx,2004,asharkov, 02/18/2004,Please reduce the exhaust noise,pos,"Before buying my 2004 MDX, I took a
test-drive in Mercedes ML350 and Volvo
XC90, and I liked the MDX much better
then either of them. I like the MDX's 
acceleration and power, as well as
luxury features, like the navigation
system and rear-view camera. What I do
not like, is a low-pitch noise coming
from either muffler, or some other part
of the exhaust system at around 2000
rpms, or at about 70-72 mi/h. If you
keep the car running at that speed for a
while, the noise becomes very annoying.  "

spaciousness, esp. of the back when 
shopping. Truly enjoy the ride, the 
interior design and all the features. 
Test drove many SUV's before we bought 
and have no second thoughts on 
purchase.Almost bought a Honda Pilot, 
but felt for a few more dollars, the 
MDX gave you alot more. Other SUV's 
(X5, Toureg, Land Rover) much more 
overpriced for what you get. "

blown away how amazeing this suv was. 
When the mdx first came out in 01 i 
knew that that was the suv that i 
wanted... I went to baysore acura and 
said i was the siver mdx, I didn't even 
test drive it once.... Just knowing the 
reputation of honda i knew it would be 
an amazeing SUV. I've had it since 2002 
and not one problem with the mdx, and i 
now have 40,000.   I recomed this suv

nothing can be done about it at this
time, and only if Acura gets enough
complaints, it may look at the problem,
and find a fix."
acura,mdx,2004,Anthony Tallo, 02/28/2004,Acura in Valley Park Mo.,pos,"The car is incredible.  I traded in a 
jeep liberty because our family needed 
more room - boy did we get it!
The car seats 7 comfortably - key is no 
wheel well in second row!
The dvd is outstanding quaility and the 
navigation sytem is reliable and 
efficient.
The car handles like a dream...the cars 
turning radius is supurb!
And the camera when the car is in 
reverse is a life saver!"
acura,mdx,2004,Edkristin, 02/29/2004,"Mildly disappointed, horrible mileage",pos,"I had expected a positive experience 
in the switch from my Volvo V70 to the 
MDX. 
The MDX still had its share of initial 
defects, from a poorly fitting & hard 
to close rear hatch to missing 
hardware on the front center consol 
box.  
The mileage is atrocious.  I'm getting 
11.9 all-around mileage against an 
advertised 18-22.  It must be a larger 
issue, because someone stopped my wife 
in a parking lot the other day to ask 
how bad her mileage was (he had the 
same problem).
In retrospect, I'd take the Volvo 
Cross-Country over the MDX any day, if 
only my 3 kids under 6 and their 
friends fit in one!"

better not using it, nav map somewaht 
time dated. 2nd one I've owned & will 
probally do it again!"
acura,mdx,2004,iquilt6, 02/29/2004,2004 Acura MDX,pos,"Best SUV I test-drove.  Competition was 
the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander 
and the MDX beat them both hands down.  
It has a smooth, comfortable ride, very 
car-like due to the chassis.  I wanted 
a third-row because I sometimes haul 
grandchildren, and I wanted that third-
row to be comfortable.  The 
Highlander's third row seat seemed like 
an afterthought, and not a very good 
one at that.  The Pilot would have been 
a good choice, but Honda would not put 
a tan interior in a white exterior -- 
VERY shortsighted in my opinion.  I am 
thrilled with the MDX -- it just keeps 
getting better."
acura,mdx,2004,dirthead, 02/29/2004,get one,pos,"nice looking inside and out. terrible on
fuel economy is worse than 8 cyl.
jeep...engine looks really cool....a
little sluggish from0- 50 ,,,,,off road
isnt too good, could have  more

comfortable ride and plenty of room,,and
plenty of cup holders. Dont misplace

battery dies ,,youll hve no music"
acura,mdx,2004,Jimrayoden, 03/02/2004,Bluetooth-enabled,pos,"I test drove an MDX with Navigation 
and was really impressed.  My question 
is for existing owners as to whether 
this model has the Handsfreelink 
(bluetooth) feature that the TL has 
which allows you to use a Bluetooth 
enabled phone to work with the car?  
On the TL, you can dial phone numbers 
in your Navigation database using your 
(bluetooth-enabled) cell phone.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Frustrated MDX, 03/03/2004,Disappointed MDX Owner,pos,"This car continues to spend more time 
at the dealership.Have had both 
headlights replaced due to design flaw 
& moisture getting inside. Lever on 
middle row seat broke.Finish on 
steering wheel cover started to come 
off.Recall for timing belt.Design flaw 
with the brake calipers & the constant 
clicking noise. Design flaw with the 
gas tank & constance sloshing sound of 
gas. The latest was the breaking of the 
power steering pulley belt that left my 
wife stranded on a LA freeway in the 
rain at night.It took Acura's roadside 
service 3 hours to finally get her 
towed.Acura's thanks to us was giving 
us a crappy Ford Focus for a loaner.  
All this for a $44k SUV."

this vehicle.  "

automotive industry- yet we do not

vehicle- I would highly suggest buyers 
to see the value and luxury you 
recieve from the mdx."
acura,mdx,2004,Catchey, 03/17/2004,Japanese Waning,pos,"ACURA is one of the disappointing 
vehicle experiences I have ever had. 
The interior is sound but the plastics 
used are soft and mar easily, numerous 
trim pieces have broken. Getting 
warranty work completed is next to 
impossible. ACURA uses a just in time 
inventory between its dealers. After 
several appointments for warranty work. 
ACURA takes the money for the service 
work and they claims to ""return"" the 
parts ordered for warranty.

The mileage rating is overstated, but 
still better than most vehicles in its 
class. Acura achieves the better than 
average rating by using the thinnest 
sheet metal ever. "
acura,mdx,2004,Jim Kurp, 03/17/2004,Not a retagged Pilot,pos,"Before purchasing I drove both the MDX 
and the Pilot. The acceleration and 
handling of the MDX were far superior 
to that of the Pilot.

It took an adjustment to move from a 
sedan to a SUV, however, the 
performance and handling of the MDX is 
comparable to my prior vehicle (98 
Volvo V70). The major difference is the 
fit/finish/quality of the MDX, which is 
far superior to that of the Volvo.

It is a vehicle I expect to own and 
enjoy for years to come."

acura,mdx,2004,John6952, 03/22/2004,Great vehicle,pos,"I've spent a lot of seat time in many

acura,mdx,2004,Robert B, 03/24/2004,Love this Acura,pos,"I LOVE this car or I mean SUV. It 
performs & drives like a car. So 
smooooooth. Great look!!! Navi is very 
nice to have but does need upgraded, 
missing a few older streets.
Breaks click kind of loud when applied 
& the shocks thump alittle when taking 
off. Not big deals but for a $45000.00 
vehicle it shouldnt be there. Leather 
could be a little softer."
acura,mdx,2004,MDX Challenge, 03/30/2004,satisfied,pos,"Test drove a good number of SUV's. This 
Acura SUV got my attention because of 
all it's safety features, good looking 
body style, very good gas mileage, good 
Bose audio sound, and nicely powered 
265 HP engine which makes it fun to 
drive with some pep. Interior audio 
controls as well as somewhat 
complicated NAV system the only knock"
acura,mdx,2004,Myque, 03/30/2004,Great SUV...not a performance car,pos,"I am happy I bought this vehicle. I 
traded a 2002 Mercedes 320C in on it. 
Thus, I realize the ride will not be a 
performance car ride...and I also 
understand this vehicle has a lot to 
offer for the $. The ride is a little 
bumpy, but the pick up, goodies added 
and over-all comfort more than make up 
for that. I compared the Lexus RX330 to 
this and thought both were great. 
However, this ride was more for the $."
acura,mdx,2004,Vixx MDX, 03/31/2004,Love my MDX,pos,"I had the Honda Pilot (which is a great

I decided to get the MDX.  Best ride 
I've ever had. :o)"

now and are very happy with the overall 
performance, fit and finish.  We 
considered teh MDX, X3, Lexux 330, and 
the Sequoia.  Overall value, 
reliability, conform of ride, power 
plant, third row seat and storage made 
the MDX an easy choice for us."
acura,mdx,2004,Goldee, 04/02/2004,Love it,pos,"I love my beautiful new car. I love 
the way it looks and handles.  I want 
to keep this car until I pay it off.  
I've never said that before."
acura,mdx,2004,smc2103, 04/05/2004,My analysis after 2 weeks.,pos,"Got my 04 MDX about 2 weeks ago. I am 
getting about 20.5 mpg (mostly 
highway, some local) on average so 
far. I am happy with this average as 
my 96 TL was giving only about 2 miles 
more.

I have no sloshing issue, however the 
2K RPM humming sound is there. 
However, I have learnt to ignore it, 
and doesn't bother me too much.

Other than that really loving the 
drive! Would have loved Acura to place 
some light over the coin tray! "
acura,mdx,2004,Paul, 07/09/2006,Paul's Acura MDX Driving impressions,pos,"The 2004 Acura MDX Touring with Entertainment system has been one of the best vehicles I've owned in any class and absolutely the best SUV to date. Comfort, reliability, ergonomics and a lot better than average SUV handling hi-light its many features."
acura,mdx,2004,Goli, 04/07/2004,Reliability>Safety>Quality>Value,pos,"3.3K. I am happier with it every day. 
QUALITY- no a rattle/squeak. Great 
leather. PERFORMANCE- fast, powerful, 
effortless. SUSPENSION-comparable SUVs 
are either too soft or too stiff, MDX 
has perfectly balanced a comfortable 
ride with very good HANDLING. UTILITY 
useful ample space, turn seating for 7 
into open flush space in just seconds. 
My dogs love this vehicle (BTW- the 
optional CARGO LINER is a must-have 
(tailor-made for the MDX protects 
interior from dogs, bikes, scuba gear, 
etc). COMFORT-very quiet (although some 
wind noise at very high speeds), 
comfortable, and great seats. AC is 
great! SE FL resident on a Black/Black."

acura,mdx,2004,Acura lover, 04/08/2004,Acura's MDX is the best SUV available,pos,"This is my second MDX.  It is the most 
comfortable and luxerious SUV I've 
ever owned.  Everything in it (besides 
the DVD and Navigation System) is 
standard.  There are no dealer ""add-
on's"".  This includes the leather 
seats, the seat heaters, moonroof, 
side curtain air bags, 6 CD changer, 
premium sound system, and premium 
paint job.  The MDX rides as smooth or 
smoother than any car I have ridden 
in.  The 265 HP engine climbs 
mountains without any hesitation."
acura,mdx,2004,Liza Cruz, 04/13/2004,My Acura MDX 2004,pos," Having search for many months for a 
SUV, I decided on the MDX, the price 
was right, 1st and formost, the vehicle 
was what I wanted, the performance was 
great, the safety features where 
excellent, this SUV is great."
acura,mdx,2004,mking, 04/08/2004,It's mine and I love it,pos,"I had one of the first MDX's (2001) off 
the line.  My husband always borrowed 
it when it rained hard or snowed.  When 
he asked what I wanted for a holiday 
gift, I said I a car he could drive in 
bad weather without taking mine.  Just 
before Christmas we bought our 2nd MDX--
one for me, and he took over the 2001 
MDX.
We had a hard winter here, with lots of 
snow--and we each loved having our own 
MDX!
I enjoy the upgrades:  265 hp, rearview 
scan in reverse, 
automatic windshield wipers, and 
automatic lights.  The new navi system 
is slightly more difficult to use, but 
has more features.  I feel safe, and I 
am glad he is safe, too."

acura,mdx,2004,tbooth2, 04/18/2004,"Had the rest, now own the best",pos,"Been through six cars since 1993, last 
vehicle was repurchased from mfg as a 
lemon.  I have to say this is the best 
so far.  Of course, the technology has 
gotten better, but this car combines 
the best of SUV/auto and sacrifices 
little except for gas mileage.  Great 
acceleration, quiet and solid with no 
squeaks/rattles or cheezy interior 
plastics. The stock rims are a little 
lame for the this price bracket, but 
they kind of grow on you and won't 
attract too much attention.  Even with 
few suggestions for improvements, we 
are very pleased with our purchase and 
would recommend this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,Quiet Please, 04/20/2004,"Love it, but a little disappointed",pos,"My 2004 is great! The ride, luxury, and 
roominess are better than any other I 
tried.  However, unexpectedly it is the 
noisiest quiet vehicle.  It is 7 months 
and it has the following noises: front 
caliper pop, rear breaks make a clunk 
noise when I change direction, they 
also make a loud rubbing noise during 
the first 10 min. of operation every 
day (all of this according to the 
dealer is normal).  The NAV system 
controls on the steering wheel dont 
work 20% of the time.  All this is not 
to say that I dont like my MDX.  I do 
like it very much.  Its just not 
perfect, which for the money I would 
have expected it to come a little 
closer."
acura,mdx,2004,Bourdeau, 04/21/2004,Happy owner,pos,"Have owned various Acuras since the 
1986 Legend and they all have been good 
for 150,000 miles plus.  Reliability is 
a big factor.  The current MDX replaces 
a Ford Explorer, 1999 and the change is 
monumental.  There are a few areas 
where the interior could be a little 
more user friendly, but overall, it is 
a joy to drive."
acura,mdx,2004,bri32974, 05/03/2004,Great Ride,pos,"I've had the vehicle for about 3 weeks 
now.  Love the ride.  It just feels 
like your driving a nice vehicle when 
driving.  All my family and friends 
love it.  I did research for about 3 
months.  Test drove alot of different 
SUV's.  The decision came down to 
either the MDX or Volkswagen Toureg.  
For the money, I thought the MDX beat 
it out.  The history of reliability and 
resale is pretty good compared to some 
of the other competitors.  I'm 
averaging about 18 to 19 miles on the 
average.  Definitely, get the side 
steps and luggage rack on the vehicle.  
That finishes off the look of the 
vehicle.  It kind of looks naked 
without it.  "
acura,mdx,2004,bmartys, 05/08/2004,"Totaled 3 month old, bought another",pos,"I totaled our 3 month old MDX at 75mph 
on the interstate. It flipped end over 
end twice across the median into 
oncoming traffic. We opted to get 
another MDX because I think I would 
have been dead in anything else even 
though none of the airbags deployed."

and Infiniti Fx 45. For the price, 
safety features and options that I 
wanted (esp. 3rd seat option), the 
Acura MDX 2004 was the Only choice. 
The Acura offers the best performance,

standards and options.  Radio system is 
excellent.  Best car that we have ever 
had!  And the wife is picky!"
acura,mdx,2004,cathy e, 05/24/2004,love it love it,pos,"I just purchased this car 1 week ago 
and so far I am totally thrilled with 
it. It drives like a dream, smoothe and 
effortless. The acceleration is quick 
and the breaks reactive. I especially 
love the sound system. The 
entertainment package comes with Bose 
speakers and the sound is incredible. 
Also, the kids are loving the DVD 
system It's a classy, beautiful, luxury 
SUV and I am a happy(beaming) new owner~"
acura,mdx,2004,Redfern, 05/25/2004,Built to last,pos,"This is my second MDX.  My first one 
performed exceptionally well.  Interior 
road noise was evident. The 2004 has 
improved markedly in many respects.  
Handling, ride, and horsepower. Better 
fuel economy is edvident. The vehicle 
is superbly engineered. While the 
brakes are excellent,  The 2001 wass 
superior."
acura,mdx,2004,cdorider, 05/22/2004,Best SUV I have owned,pos,"I have owned 2 suv's before this one 
and after owning my 4Runner I thought 
no other suv in this price range would 
come close, but the MDX changed my 
mind.his is an awsome suv. "
acura,mdx,2004,VirginiaBlues, 05/22/2004,Dream SUV,pos,"Having only had this vehicle for less 
than a month, some of my opinions could 
change.  However, at this point in the 
game it is without a doubt the finest 
vehicle I have ever driven, including 
the Lexus, Cadillac, Jags and BMW's.
I frequently put 50k miles per year on 
vehicles, so this was a consideration 
when choosing Acura.  The resale on 
Acura's is extremely high, and talk to 
anyone who has ever had one; they LOVE 
them.
After reading Consumer Reports rate it, 
I knew I couldn't go wrong."
acura,mdx,2004,minnie999, 05/29/2004,Probably best SUV for today,pos,"Performance has been excellent except

manufacturing defects."
acura,mdx,2004,ACSInc., 06/01/2004,Acura 04,pos,"We took this vehicle from Coatesville, 
PA to Portland Maine right out of the 
box.  It performed perfectly.  The 
Nav. system came in real handy when 
our son's flight was cancelled and we 
went from Portland ME to Boston to 
pick him up.$41500 including 6% PA. 
sales tax. Not cheap but worth it.  
You sit higher than the mini van but 
the ride is stiffer. "
acura,mdx,2004,carl555, 05/31/2004,mdx ride,pos,"Recently, I woke up late for my flight. 
It entailed a fast ride to the 
airport.At speeds of 80-90 mph I really 
experienced the true handling of this 
vehicle.It was pure peformance. The 
engine purred and the ride was tight 
and really tracked to the road. For an 
SUV it was unbelievable. This really is 
a great vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,TNMDX, 06/02/2004,Love my MDX,pos,"We purchased our MDX out of state to 
get a better deal and enjoyed trying 
out the navigation and DVD in a new 
city and on a long trip.  The 
navigation was wonderful and helped us 
get around the city with ease.  Also, 
the restaurant locator was excellent.  
The rest stop finder is nice too.  If 
you travel, the navigation feature is a 
must-have!  The DVD is nice too.  Very 
solid in the ceiling and doesn't block 
the driver's rear view as much as some 
other models.  The ride quality is 
excellent.  The seats are comfortable 
and it has good room in the 2nd row.  
We have two carseats in the back seat 
and I can still sit very comfortably 
between the two seats.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Bootstau, 06/07/2004,Better than our Lexus,pos,"The MDX has surpased my expectations. 
The ride is quite and extemely 
comfortable. We had a Lexus RX 300 and 
it was smaller and did not have the 
same power. It handles great and has 
surprising excelleration.The interior 
is set up great. Plenty of room even in 
the third row seats."
acura,mdx,2004,gohogsgo, 06/08/2004,Just Love It.......,pos,"We purchased a loaded MDX last October 
and have loved everything almost 
everything about it.  The only thing 
that has gone wrong with the car is one 
of the headlight bulbs burned out at 6k 
miles.  Of course this was under 
warranty but a hassel none the less.  
It is a fun car to drive. The kids just 
love the dvd and we love the headphones!

Another thing I should mention is that 
the nav system isn't as current as I 
would have expected.  The neighborhood 
that we live in was built in 1999 and 
is not in the system.  Also my office 
which has been open since 1997 isn't in 
there either.  The software could use 
some updating."
acura,mdx,2004,Michael Norwich, 06/13/2004,Never Better,pos,"The MDX has very good gas mileage for 
the type of SUV.It's very practical 
and nice. Its as comfortable as any 
other car. I love it. The car could 
use a better bumper for door dings, 
though."
acura,mdx,2004,The Donahue Family, 06/18/2004,The BEST experience!!!,pos,"We just purchased our 04 MDX we love

acura,mdx,2004,olie, 06/23/2004,My MDX,pos,"Absolutely the best I have bought. I 
was originally going to purchase a BMW

It has more features and creature 
comforts at no extra charge. I also was 
impressed with its handling ability at 
higher speeds.  "
acura,mdx,2004,A. Montano, 06/17/2004,#1 SUV on the road!,pos,"The MDX is the best SUV out on the

a Honda (a great car) to the Acura 
MDX.  It's not only reliable, nice 
looking but the best SUV on the road 
not only for moms but for anyone 
interested in an SUV.  I have test 
driven other SUV's and the MDX is the 
perfect size.  It's not too big and not 
too small.  Plus it is considered one 
of the safest SUV's out there.  It 
can't get any better than that."
acura,mdx,2004,cheri loyd, 06/24/2004,Love my Red Rock MDX,pos,"Only complaint? It's difficult to 
thoroughly clean front seat interior 
area around the ""cracks""-near gear 
shift,cup holder and door panels.  I am 
very pleased with gas mileage-I have 
gotten over 23MPG on the highway twice.
Probably would have been 25 if I had 
kept it down to 55.

great acceleration (but feels slow), 
slight wind noise (but 200% better than 
my Integra), simple instrumentation, 
slightly wider than I would have liked

awesome, smooth ride.  What else can I 
say....so far, I really like it.
I waited until the last day of June to 
buy.  On the last day of the month, all 
Acura dealers dropped their prices to 
at least $500 over invoice.  I paid 
invoice price, plus they threw-in a 
decor package."
acura,mdx,2004,Bill San Diego, 07/09/2004,Fix those brakes!,pos,"We love this car! Great flexibilty 
with the seats in the back and we 
don't have to worry about fitting into 
parking spaces like Yukon owners.  
Great engine and the sound system is 
great!  The only complaint is the damn 
clicking in the brakes..what is the 
deal with that?!?!

We didn't want to pay what U.S. 
dealers were charging so we bought it 
for less including shipping to our 
house in San Diego by buying it from a 
Canadian dealership.  NO PROBLEMS and 
we get the daytime running lights."
acura,mdx,2004,Mom13, 07/10/2004,Acura MDX,pos,"This is a wonderful car to own...so 
comfortable...rides more like a car 
than an SUV.

Spacious inside...not crammnped...a 
delight!!"
acura,mdx,2004,gilljacr, 07/10/2004,Best car I ever bought,pos,"The car is wonderful. Our only regret 
is not spending the extra money on the 
touring model. This car drives like a 
dream"
acura,mdx,2004,JHCleveland, 07/12/2004,Excellent SUV,pos,"We have had the Acura MDX for 8 months 
now and absolutely love it!  It has 
been a perfect car and have had 
absolutely no problems.  The only thing 
you have to be careful about is that, 
with the 265 Horsepower engine, it is 
easy to get going too fast - have to 
watch those speed limits carefully."
acura,mdx,2004,phenry, 07/14/2004,"So far, so excellent",pos,"Not gone too far yet, but so far 
everything I could hope for.  Drives 
like a Acura sports sedan and almost 
as good as my quatro Audi.  A dream on 
the highway, especially if you are 
used to driving an old fashion SUV.  
Nav system very intuitive and 
impressively accurate."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXLVR, 07/18/2004,The most for the Money,pos,"I love the MDX, It blows away the Lexus 
for the money, the Volvo has a good 
looking interior, but doesn't have any 
of the features that are available in 
the Acura.  The Nav system & the 
entertainment system are very user 
friendly & are worth the price.  It's 
the best luxury vehicle for the money."

acura,mdx,2004,deva, 07/22/2004,Made my neighbors jealous....,pos,"38,500 + tax
After researching a lot on SUVs that 
have a 3rd row option, we settled with 
the 4Runner (V8) and the MDX. After 
test driving MDX, my wife didn't like 
the rough handling of the 4Runner. 
Style and safety were our main 
concerns. MDX, being Acura's only SUV, 
they have really expended significant 
research into it. The twin exhaust and 
the VSC in the 2004 model embellishes 
the 265-hp engine. We got the silver 
with ebony interior. I recommend 
getting the all-purpose mats 
($120.00), original mats seemed to 
stick everything that falls on it. A 
good-size SUV that is stylish, 
powerful, and yet quite smooth to 
handle, but not for unpaved adventu"
acura,mdx,2004,Bob Lazarus, 07/26/2004,2004 Acura MDX,pos,"Overall this is an excellent vehicle 
that can haul an amazing amount of 
people or cargo when necessary."
acura,mdx,2004,djreid2, 07/30/2004,Solid Car,pos,"This is a great car that will last for 
a lifetime. It is cheaper than the 
lexus and roomier. The acceleration is 
very good for a SUV. The only downfalls 
are gas mileage and no in dash cd 
changer. The lexus had more options, 
but the Acura has more value"
acura,mdx,2004,MICHELEB, 07/31/2004,GREAT SUV FOR THE PRICE,pos,"WE ARE DELIGHTED WITH OUR MDX,THE 
TOURING PKG OFFERS A LOT COMPARED TO 
OTHER SUV'S WHICH CHARGE EXTRA FOR 
EVERYTHING! THE BACK WINDOW SHOULD OPEN 
TO OFFER GREATER FUNCTION AND THE BACK 
WINDOWS HAVING THE ABILITY TO ""VENT 
OPEN"" WOULD BE A NICE ADDED FEATURE. 
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE 
UPDATED AS TO CURRENT LOCATIONS, IT 
DOES NOT ALWAYS LIST ACCURATE ""PLACES"" 
TO GO. WE LOVE THE HEADSETS FOR THE 
BACK PASSENGERS, BUT AT $100 A HEADSET, 
IT ADDS UP TO EQUIP ALL OF THE RUGRATS

TRAVEL ALOT AND LOVE THE QUIET ENGINE.

headlights lost its seal, and we 
expected better initial quality."
acura,mdx,2004,Mike Schurr, 08/07/2004,Acura MDX Best of the Class,pos,"We purchased this car for my wife who 
had two Toyota Land Cruisers back to 
back for the past six years. To say the 
least she loves the MDX as do I. I may 
not be as big as a Land Cruiser but the 
build quality, performance and ride are 
exceptional. The engine is pure Honda, 
it is barely audible when running but 
when you put your foot in it the power 
is fantastic for an SUV. 

By knowing the dealer cost via Edmunds, 
visiting one dealer and getting a price 
via the net we bought the MDX for 
dealer invoice. Yes it can be done!
A great car at a great price, what more 
could one ask for."
acura,mdx,2004,terry woram, 08/11/2004,Trading up from ML320 to MDX,pos,"My previous suv was the Mercedes 
ML320.  After driving the MDX I felt 
that I was trading up to more features 
and convenience for the price.  Living 
in the DC area I can not tell you how 
amazing the GPS is.  Also, the camera 
for backing up is a great feature since 
I have young children and it is my 
greatest fear to injure someone while 
backing up."
acura,mdx,2004,philcosal, 08/12/2004,2004 MDX,pos,"Tried them all and the MDX was the 
winner.  No regrets after 8000 miles. 
Nav unit simply marvelous - can find 
about anything any where.  Update 
price a bit stiff. Only nit piks are 
driver position in respect to 
steering, girls love it the long 
legged guys find it less than ideal.  
Road noise too noticable - gets old 
after 8 hours of interstate.  Detest 
the service requirement for 
differential fluid, only available 
from Acrua/Honda no alternative found, 
they charge $60 to change - seems a 
bit pricy.  Might not have purchased 
MDX had I known this in advance.  
Don't like sold here only deals.  Live 
and learn.  4Runner next choice."
acura,mdx,2004,lovin it, 08/14/2004,Pretty Nice,pos,"After driving the car for over 800 mi, 
I've finally come to really appreciate 
the MDX.I did have a major pain in the 
butt experience (literally) after 
sitting in the traffic in LA for an 1 
1/2 hrs.  Every rear end is different, 
so this is a personal experience & u 
might not experience the same 
displeasure.  Luckily, for my glut, it 
has been broken in and the ride is 
less painful and the drive more 
pleasurable. Now, I could've bought 
the XC90 & been whistling Dixie, but 
the 10k extra, the week engine and 
lack of off road ablities...didn't sit 
well."
acura,mdx,2004,PinakinDesai, 08/16/2004,My MDX,pos,"Excellent performance overall. The only 
thing that they could improve upon is 
the wind noise. I also wish they had 
not taken away the Sun glass holder. 
Other than that excellent car. "
acura,mdx,2004,MGZ, 08/21/2004,Acura makes the best SUV,pos,"This is an excellent Suv. Only the 85K 
Range Rover compares.After test- 
driving the 
Toureag,X5,ML350,PIlot,GX470,Land 
Crusier, and XC90, the MDx was my 
choice due to having the best 
combination of on and off road 
performance,features, styling in and 
out,dashboard 
layout,prestige,reliability,and value. 
I think that I spent my 46K well(It's 
the best SUV in the segment).I love my 
Acura."

have been looking at SUV for about a 
year know and were in no rush to 
purchase one.  We have driven 
everything from the full size to the 
crossovers.  Yukon/Tahoe, Armada, 
FX35, X5, Discovery, ML350 and 
Pathfinder.  None come close to the 
value and options you get in the MDX. 
Take your time and drive them all! The 
MDX was the last SUV we looked at and 
ended up being the one!"
acura,mdx,2004,mjcw, 09/03/2004,Love this car!,pos,"After a year of researching and debating, my 
husband and I just bought this car, and 
could not be happier! The MDX is not only 
incredibly nice looking inside and out, but 
also drives like silk. There is an underlying 
reliability factor that comes from its Honda 
roots - and I feel both safe and very 
comfortable inside. We looked at the Pilot, 
Highlander, and Audi wagons and came full 
circle back to the MDX. End of the year sales 
discounts were worth the wait! Buy one - you 
won't be disappointed."

better on gas mileage, sticker stated 
17/ 23 and that is not the case it is 
more like 14.7/18. also the car is very 
sleak on the outside but would be 
better with some door gaurds so when 
others hit your door you dont end up 
with a very expensive dent. also navi 
gets stuck sometimes and you have to 
restart the car to even use the ac 
properly. and window locks are dumb 
because you cant let the passenger 
control the window without enableling 
your kids to do so to."

acura,mdx,2005,Kevin M, 09/05/2015,"Yes , the transmission is a problem",pos,"Very good Suv. Love the AWD. Felt safe going down the road, it feels like driving a tank. But, the transmission failed at 160000 and we were left stranded on the side of the road. Also, some other little issues. Used regular gas. It did a good job towing. We finally did trade it in at 200000 miles and Lindsay Acura Cols. Gave us 5000 for it. It had a lot of bumps and bruises on it from towing and parking lots. Overall a good suv if Honda would solve the transmission problems that the MDX has.
"
acura,mdx,2005,mdxer, 08/08/2010,'05 MDX,pos,"Replacing Cadillac Eldorado and more than happy with the change. The MDX had 82,000 miles when I got it,  97,000 six months later without any trouble, except with an a/c vent cover.  Early on I had the opportunity to drive for several hours in a blizzard with complete confidence. I have also had it on unimproved old logging roads with equal confidence. I would not take it where I would take a 4Runner, but I prefer cabin comforts.  The cabin is awesome and the toys are awesome. Front seats are 5 star. This is my favorite car ever.  I installed after market transmission and power steering filters as a precaution. The tranny's are suspect. I drive in D4 around town and D5 only over 60 mph."

acura,mdx,2005,MHirt1, 05/16/2015,Lots of mechanical issues,pos,"I am the original owner of my 2005 MDX, and currently have about 130,000 miles on the car.  We have had many mechanical issues with this car, including:

- failed torque converter at about 55,000 miles
- failed transmission cooler at about 85,000 miles which caused intermingling of transmission and radiator fluids - not good
- failed electrical harness unit - had to wait to get one from Germany!
- numerous suspension issues
- rust appearing on front of hood and in all four wheel wells starting at around 100,000 miles

Even my 15-year old Saab has had far fewer, and less expensive, mechanical issues.  I am not sure whether I will buy another MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,driddle, 02/06/2010,Trouble with transmission,pos,"Great car, but have had trouble with transmission. Has been replaced once already at 50000 miles, still makes hard shifts when shifting down."
acura,mdx,2005,seahawks_fan, 02/07/2013,Think b4 you buy your next Acura,pos,"Think b4 you buy your next Acura. My 05 MDX slammed and
locked its brakes while doing 40mph and
 almost killed my family. It happened three times in less than a month.
Dealership won't fix the modulator that is most likely the cause because it would
cost them $1600. The seat belt locked on my 9 month old pregnant wife's belly
and cause my other kids head to whip lash. They have had my car for over a week now and waiting on Corporate to take responsibility. It's sad that saving $1600 is more important than the lives of 6 people. Come on Acura/Honda.
Update: After having my $50,000 luxury car for a week, the decided they will only replace a $100 part called a brake switch. But they refused to replace the other problem, $1600 abs modulator. Their diagnostic computer told them both were failing parts. The service manager told me they are not wear and tear parts and should not have gone bad.
So they sent me off with my family hoping they guessed right. So now the car sits on my drive way. I refuse to put my family in danger. Had I been on the freeway or crossing our states snowy mountains, my family might not be here right now. I wouldn't be here to share this with others.
I told the claim manage than my family has bought 3 accords, two civics, Acura RL and the MDX the past 20 years, while spending over $100,000.
Yet, he said that wasn't enough of loyalty."
acura,mdx,2005,brannguyen, 05/21/2012,TRANSMISSION,pos,"I bought this from a used Honda dealership-in Marietta, GA, Aug. 2011. Was really excited to own my Acura SUV w/ 3rd row! Honda had a good reputation w/ reliability except for their transmission issue! I didn't realized it until it was too late! I had it checked out by Ed Voyles Acura-Chamblee. They said it was fine & they even did the transmission chip software recall. They found nothing wrong w/ it! They even took it upon themselves to do the FULL 105k service w/ timing belt w/ out getting my approval or trying to figure out what was wrong w/ the transmission. I was really upset! I even rode w/ them to see why it would vibrate at 50-60mph. Of course it wouldn't make that noise. "
acura,mdx,2005,kpsmith, 06/24/2010,Transmission vibrates/grinds at 35-40 mph,pos,"At approximately 30,000 miles, upon acceleration, the transmission would vibrate/grind until 45 mph.  I have found this to be a common problem on many Acura forums and there are 11 reports of this exact same problem on the National Highway Transportation and Safety (NHTSA) website.  The problem seems to be the transmission torque converter."
acura,mdx,2005,unhappykris, 01/02/2014,someone will sue Acura,pos,"second MDX, 7th Honda vehicle, last one had tranny issues, this one had the tranny noise slightly.
2012 I get a letter saying transmission software upgrade, so I took it in.
Especially in case I had tranny issues in future they would say that I had not done this upgrade they suggested.
The upgrade made the 5th gear come on at 45 MPH instead of the original 40 MPH.
This removed the noise, but, the gas consumption is terrible now as 90% of my city driving is below 45 MPH!
The should fix bad designs, not make us pay for it.
Also, I cannot prove this yet, but another ""recall software upgrade"" has disabled my Vehicle Stability Assist"".
This is NOT how a luxury make should do things!"
acura,mdx,2005,Cole Dabney, 06/07/2017,Excellent Vehicle,pos,"I have owned the car for seven years now. It had 54,000 on it when I bought it and now has 162,000. It is a pretty comfy car but can get uncomfy during long road trips. I have had zero problems with the vehicle since I purchased it. The only issue I have had is the torque converter started shuddering. Normally youd think oh typical Honda torque converter gone bad. But not the case! The fluid had not been changed since the car was new so I drained and filled the fluid once and the shudder disappeared. I did this 4 more times just to get most of the old fluid out with new genuine Honda fluid. Dont let someone tell you you need a new torque converter until you drain and fill the transmission WITH HONDA FLUID. Aside from this its been 100% reliable. I towed a 3000lb boat from Ohio to Florida at 160,000mi with zero issues. Overall I am really happy with the car.

They really made a beast with this one, i just revived a flooded tranni w/ busted radiator .. Few flushes & replacements later i still havent spent what its worth and it, honest to goodness i cant make this up, it runs. like. new @ 222,179 miles ladies and gentlemen. I could not tell you of another engine that would not only handle that kind of damage while driving with strawberry milk in my tranni oil for a week, unknowingly. Never once did it putter, squeek, squeel, tick, shake.. Just ran smooth, with a little less power. It still blows my mind that this is my daily driver now lol. I recommend this car because of its outstanding safety and reliability, not to mention cost of repairs are not an arm and a leg because they're Honda parts. (how brilliant) If i could give any advise, keep up with your maint. spend a few extra dollars to get better quality fluids/parts. Youll thank yourself later. :)

Never had a single problem in over 5 years of driving and towing, just scheduled maintenance.  Interior has everything and well designed.  I'd definitely buy a new one, but the new ones can't be towed - too bad.  I highly recommend this vehicle - great family SUV."
acura,mdx,2005,Janet, 07/18/2005,Very Disappointed in my MDX,neg,"Clunking noises that ""can't be fixed"". Said MDX just makes these noises w/ no remedy <-NOT an acceptable answer!!!  Poor design features:  no continuous visible outside temperature readout; recirculating air setting does not stay on-must be constantly re-set; Navigation system NOT user friendly.  Also, static in AM radio. Over-designed in some areas; under-designed in others. Manufacturer not willing to remedy problems.  Spent over $40,000 for a car that does not meet expectations. "
acura,mdx,2005,EWD, 08/03/2005,Built Just For Me,pos,"I am a tall driver (6'4"")and always must ""try on"" an automobile for fit in head,leg and foot room, steering wheel positioning and instrument and control visibility and convenience.  The MDX fits me almost perfectly.  I could use a little more room for my left foot, but head and leg room are great.  instruments and controls are conveniently located and visibility is excellent.  For me it has smooth acceleration, a firm but not harsh ride and a confidence building feel of the road.  Cargo space is excellent and thirdf row seating comfortable for the occasional need to transport my four grand kids and two adults.  Pleasing exterior styling that I think beats anything else on the road."
acura,mdx,2005,JCPHX, 07/26/2007,A great all-purpose SUV,pos,"Extremely comfortable, quiet ride with excellent performance.  I purchased with all the bells and whistles, including DVD with rear speaker control - perfect for long trips with kids.  Also, with two rows of seats that fold down, easily converts to a good SUV for hauling stuff.  Bluetooth for the mobile phone is now a must-have.  The voice-activated nav system seemed cool at first, but it was the one thing that didn't always perform perfectly.  Still, this is my first Acura and the best vehicle I have ever owned. "

acura,mdx,2005,JC in DC, 12/03/2010,A piece of feces wrapped in gold,neg,"Its bright and shiny on the outside and completely unreliable on the inside. The transmission failed at 71000 miles - dealer wants $4,000 to repair.  Paid $45,592 new for the vehicle and $6465 on repairs since 2005. If we pay for the transmission it will be over $10,000 - more than 22% of the original cost.  Bluetooth stopped working at 50,000 miles  Engine required $3,278 worth of repairs at 60,000 miles.  We use this car as our primary family vehicle - nothing strenuous or abusive.  I would never buy a Honda product ever again."
acura,mdx,2005,Van Sean, 04/04/2009,Rear main seal - transmission,pos,"Barely out of warranty and the rear main seal (rear crankshaft seal) failed. The sad part is I just paid off this sucker.  Transmission also started to develop problems. Replacing the rear main seal can cost upward $2000 (mostly labor) but this won't stop the other transmission related problems. I finally gave up and traded it in for a new car. This was a loss-loss situation for me.  Acura quality is falling apart. Sadly, I am not the only ones being affected by this...avoid at all cost! "
acura,mdx,2005,JP, 02/24/2009,I thought Acura/Honda's were relable?,pos,"I really liked the features of the vehicle.   Drove it one week and started hearing a ""rumbling"" noise around 30-40 mph.   Seemed like the transmission was having problems shifting.  Dealer had it for two weeks, had to rebuild the transmission and replace the torque converter.   Luckily I will have 3 years/36,000 mile warranty on the transmission.   Besides that, nothing else to complain about so far.   I thought Acura/Hondas were supposed to be very reliable?"

Nice improvments for 2005.  The one annoying problem that has been an issue for years is a brake ""thud"" when applying brakes backing up.  Seems silly that Acura can't fix an embarrassing problem after years of feedback on this.       "
acura,mdx,2005,Acura MDX, 08/18/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"I have had my MDX for 2 months. So far I love driving the car. It's comfortable and reliable. I just wish the gas milage was better. One thing that came standard with all my previous vehicles is automatic door locks when the car is being driven, which is not available on the MDX. I also would like to see keyless entry and a more sensitive automatic headlight mechanism. "
acura,mdx,2005,Frank Barton, 01/05/2005,Not Luxury Quality,pos,"Purchased new two months ago, we have
put 5000 miles on the MDX. At about 1500
miles the LCD display locked up (froze)
causing loss of the ability to use the
nav or to control the heating and air
conditioning (a real bummer when you're
lost in a strange city). After turning
the car off for approx. 1/2 hr. it
appeared that the electronics cooled off
enough to start working again.
The thermostat on the heater/air
conditioner has never worked properly
and the interior fogs up easily on humid
days.
Several other things, like loose
retaining screws on some of the external
body parts,etc. indicate a general lack
of concern for quality."
acura,mdx,2005,Ed, 05/11/2005,Borrow some minivan features,pos,"Not bad for driver, but third row passengers are very limited. Need more leg room and easy to get in/off. How about power sliding rear doors instead of traditional wings and power lift gate would be a good features to borrow from minivans. Automatic doors locking feature at the speed greater than 20 mph."
acura,mdx,2005,Jeff, 06/21/2005,Acura,pos,"We've had vehicle for 1yr and it's only been back to dealership once due to a slip in transmission. Dealer checked it out and right away they decided to replace transmission because Acura wanted to disassemble and assess. We were impressed! Great family vehicle, it's much roomier than you would think by looking at it."
acura,mdx,2005,Acura Driver, 08/19/2005,Nice Truck,pos,"I test drove many many SUV's and none could compare to the price and features of the MDX.  That's the reason I also drive a 2004 TL.  Unfortunately, the MDX is not nearly as nice as the TL.  The nav screen is smaller, no dual climate control, the buttons on the wheel dont light up, no power up and down feature for driver and passenger windows, and the stereo is anemic in comparison.  This is just nit picking, but the MDX should have the same or better features especially since it is $10K more than the TL.  Despite these very minor issues this is a great SUV.  Space and workmanship are top notch.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Weston Rowe, 01/12/2018,My MDX is a great vehicle,pos,"This is the best vehicle I've owned. Gas mileage is only 15-17 in the city but much better on the interstate, so it makes up for it. I've had no issues with this vehicle so far it's got 150k and I bought it at 130k so it's still kinda new to me, but it feels very put together and is great on the interstate.  I'm 6'3"" and I gotta say it's about 2 inches short height wise when I'm driving, If I sit all the way up the top of my vision is looking through the very bottom of the factory tint strip on the top where the rearview mirror is glued. So I'd say if you're under 6 feet tall you'll have no problems with this vehicle. Definitely recommend, and it's a unique vehicle not too many on the road because it's a fairly new model , relatively. The Japanese know what they're doing, let's face it why drive anything else when you're going to drop serious coin on a huge machine like this. I'm really glad I bought it, and takes care of everything I need without a pick-up truck payment.
"
acura,mdx,2005,Dennis in Edmonds, 01/30/2019,Keeps on Ticking!,pos,"I bought my 2005 MDX from used car lot with 150,000 miles. It sat on the lot for long time, so I picked it up for $6,000.  It was cosmetically beat up, but I wasn't afraid to own it as I have the greatest independent Japanese Auto mechanic.  He said it was mechanically sound.   I'm retired, so I've had time to upgrade:  Suspension, Running Boards, Catalytic Converters, all  LED Lights, Window Regulator, Starter, all dents removed,  reupholstered front seat bottoms myself. It now looks and drives really nice!   It now has 173,000 miles and I've spent a total of $5,000 in maintenance repairs and upgrades.  This SUV hums along like a Japanese Clock!  This is my 3rd MDX of this series (2001 to 2006). Frankly, I occasionally think of getting something sexier or newer, but you just cannot beat the reliability and comfort of this vehicle. Plus, the interior of this SUV is huge.  The newer ones were reduced in size and I don't like the style as much.   I know that my honest mechanic will keep me on the road no matter what. However,  I recommend that everyone should buy  a OBD2 scanner, learn to read codes and research fixes on Youtube.    From what I've read,  I know that a transmission may be in my future.  But,  I'm not worried, as I know a great transmission guy.  At the price I've paid for this car,  I can afford a transmission.  Oh, the AWD is excellent in ice and snow.  I run Bizzaks  on spare wheels in the winter and it never gets stuck.  All round great vehicle and I would drive it anywhere.  Wish gas mileage was better, but then what SUV gets great mileage?  Again, considering the price I paid for the car and I can afford gas."
acura,mdx,2005,B. Thesing, 03/29/2019,THIS IS A GREAT CAR FOR THE MONEY,pos,"This car is a great car, especially considering it's a 14 year old car. Mine has 186,000 miles on it and still runs like a clock! This was a great buy although I did have to get the transmission replaced at 140,000 but that was the only problem I have had. Also make sure to get the timing belt replaced at the regular intervals, this is an interference engine and the valves will bend if the belt breaks. Great sound system, great room, great comfort, and usability. Buy this car if your in the market for an older luxury SUV with a lot of life left in it! (Quick note, this car does require premium fuel, so take that into account when considering operating costs.) I average about 15 city, 21-22 highway so keep that in mind that gas isn't cheap for this thing.
"
acura,mdx,2005,VW, 08/22/2008,A Little Overrated,pos,"I find the MDX to be more hefty and top heavy in driving dynamics than I expected.  It's pretty thirsty at 15 MPG city.  Engine seems rock solid and smooth. Ride suspension is tuned nicely -- not too firm, not too mushy.  Should have HID and lane change signal without having to clicking on the signal arm.  Stereo is pretty good quality. XM is nice.  Navi and Handsfree link are a little awkward to use.       "
acura,mdx,2005,MDX man, 09/21/2009,Extended warranty,neg,"I have this truck for over 4years, I took to dealer at least 5 times for various problem.... Nice design, need to improve quality... Starter, Valve, Transmission, shock-- etc some of the few problems that have with this truck...."
acura,mdx,2005,BB, 12/11/2017,Biggest mistake of the decade,neg,"If you are buying an Acura MDX of 2005, big mistake, we bought it, used it for a decade just fine, don't get me wrong, there was no issues with her from 2010 ( we bought her used) till 2014. We paid and kept updated for everything we possibility can. In last 2 years, we have spent for transmission, brakes, spark plug, coil, batteries, tires and brakes, some of these are repeated expenses. Total of approximately $11,000 in last 1 year and she stopped on me again this morning. I wish I had taken a new one instead of investing so much on her. What a rotten piece of machine. Yes I don't have a right to complain because she did fine for the first decade, but what is the point of keeping a constant flow of expenses if this is what we have to deal with.
"
acura,mdx,2005,GatorJeff, 03/27/2010,Been a Good SUV,pos,"Overall this has been a solid vehicle. The only problem has been the torque converter at 57,000 miles.  Acura paid a large portion of the repair cost though.  I really love the MDX and can't seem to find anything worth selling it for.  I usually keep cars for three years but after 5 I want to hang on to it for a while longer.  I really like the design and interior technology."
acura,mdx,2005,atlas, 02/27/2006,Don't let them fool you this is a truck!,pos,"I have had many Acura's even a new NSX, an RL etc. and this car is a disappointment overall and after one year I am looking to trade it for something different. Here are my complaints- 1) NOISY on the road-- wind noise from the rearview mirrors, tire noise that is mindnumbing after 30 miles 2) a sloshing noise from the fuel tank which is insulting for a car over $40,000 -- unforgiveable 3) Some sort of noise from the brakes after you back up-- dealer says they have to reset or some story 4) XM radio cannot be scrolled through the stations numerically with the station titles displaying quickly- it takes seconds for the station title to display. 5) Voice activated is a joke-- hardly works-"
acura,mdx,2005,JDog, 05/11/2005,Very satisfied with our choice,pos,"We looked at the usual suspects in this category.  Ultimately, we went with the MDX as the best overall combination of drive quality, convenience and comfort - it's a great car.  "
acura,mdx,2005,edavis, 05/23/2005,Rides like a go-cart,neg,"When I first purchased by Acura, I loved it. But after the first year and several miles later the suspension is terrible.  It bounces like a go-cart and the brakes are pretty scary too. I believe that it is the front wheel drive that causes the problem with this SUV. The dealer tells me that I have to come in and spend $600 to reset the suspension to the original factory specs, this must be a recurring problem with this vehicle. The air conditioner also makes a loud rattling sound. "
acura,mdx,2005,Joanne, 06/19/2008,Love This Car!,pos,"Bought this car in February of 2005.  Haven't had one problem with it since!  Very reliable and very luxurious.  Was coming from a 1998 Toyota Camry LE.   Compared it to the Lexus RX 330.  While the Lexus was nice, it couldn't fit 3 people across the third row comfortably.  But my Acura can. The Bose stereo in my MDX simply superb and this car handles so nicely.  The nav system is also extremely easy to use.  Like the V6 and the AWD.  I also like the visibility that comes with being higher off the ground.  Will never buy anything other than an Acura.  Unfortunately the gas mileage is around 12 MPG.  I do mostly city driving but  I was expecting more like 16 from a mid-size SUV with just a V6."
acura,mdx,2005,2005 MDX, 07/06/2008,2005 MDX Review,pos,"Bought the original style MDX because I just knew the new model wouldn't be as nice.  I have never been so happy with a car in my life.  It's a wonderful highway cruiser and up in the rockies, it just handles the whoop di doos very solidly, no floating around, just well composed ride.  Mileage is 21 highway average at 75 mph and around town 13 (100% stop & go).  I got the touring model with nav & the tow package.  The AWD works wonderfully.  I took it out in the desert near Moabe, Utah and it will go down creeks & up sand banks with ease.  In snow it's a joy, give a lot of confidence in any type of bad weather.  Reliability has been excellent with only the nav being replaced, have 75K miles"
acura,mdx,2005,Michael Miers, 08/01/2008,My favorite vehicle ever owned!!!,pos,"I love my MDX. Nothing wrong with it, and have had no problems. This is my favorite vehicle I have ever owned. Bluetooth works great!"
acura,mdx,2005,Big Fan, 12/07/2008,My Wife Loves this Car,pos,"This is a great car.  Comfortable seats, quiet, smooth.  My wife's friends always ask her to drive because they all love this car. Very reliable - transmission replaced under warranty, no other problems."
acura,mdx,2005,Brocktune, 01/02/2008,Great Car,pos,"Bought this car new in March 05 and have loved every minute of it.  My only regret was not talking the wife into getting the Navi.   Test drove all the competitors, but the MDX blew them all away.  I love the car-like handling.  The bluetooth can have trouble picking up my voice when the air or heater is on.  It has led to some frustrating exchange (me--""dial 911""  MDX--""now calling 753.""  Also, there is a sloshing sound from the gas tank. I took it back to the dealier shortly after purchase, but there was nothing they could do about it.  Eventually, I just got used to it, and I no longer notice it.  "
acura,mdx,2005,IZJ, 09/04/2009,Outstanding Family Vehicle,pos,"The MDX is overall a truly outstanding family vehicle.  Ours has 74,000 miles of intense use and wear.  The balance of comfort, utility, passenger space, cargo room, handling and performance is remarkable.  Honda is a packaging genius for figuring out how to create so much space in a reasonably compact vehicle.  Acceleration is good for a heavy vehicle.  Interior room is excellent and the leather seats are comfortable and durable.  Many long  road trips have been completed with enjoyment and ease. My wife and I have 3 children, aged 4-11. Gas mileage is solid, 16 city, 24-25 pure highway.  An early electrical problem was fixed and we have had no other issues. We will keep our MDX for years. "
acura,mdx,2005,desertmom, 01/05/2011,I love this car,pos,"I have had my MDX for over 5 years it now has
126,000 miles. I have not had any problems and it runs great. I definitely would buy another."
acura,mdx,2005,raoanil, 12/04/2004,raoanil review,pos,This is a great SUV for the money.  It provides a comfortable ride and is a very high quality product.  I would clearly recommend this to anyone in the market for a luxury SUV.   
acura,mdx,2005,keehn, 12/22/2004,Perfect,pos,"After a 2-month search and test drives of the FX-45, RS-330, Touareg, SRX, & XC-90, I short-listed the Lexus RS-330 and the MDX.  I found the MDX to be the all around winner.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Chaos, 01/06/2005,Great SUV,pos,"Just got this car and drove it up to Tahoe in time for 9 feet of snow.  Handling was flawless.  Didn't think I would like the XM radio and backup camera (both included) but have decided that they are good to have as well.  I test drove virtually all other SUVs in this price range +/- $20k.  Handling of the MDX was among the best,  acceleration was adequate even at 65mph, height above the road was good.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Jack Wall, 01/13/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Shop and compare you won't beat this SUV when it comes to style, quality, reliability, and value.  I've test driven nearly all the mid size luxury SUV's and you can't beat this car. The ride is solid on wet and dry pavement, on back roads or cruising at 80 mph down the freeway.  Going skiing driving on ice and snow there is no slips going up or down.  There is room for all the gear and four people in the car!  Who needs a rack.  Going golfing same thing.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Vigi, 01/14/2005,Great Car,pos,"'05 MDX replaced my '92 4Runner, I get perfect parking 100% of the time, using the rear camera, excellent design and integration of front stereo with rear entertainment system. Very comfortable, kids love it to. I'm waiting for the hybride version of this car, it gobles gas alot, but it worth the comfort."
acura,mdx,2005,Imran, 02/01/2005,MDX,pos,"The MDX is a phenomenal car.  If you compare the MDX versus the X5, which I was doing, there is NO comparison.  It gives you comfort, power and the all the gadgets guys love.  I got my MDX, basically fully loaded, for $42K, that is pretty good for the class that this vehicle is in.  "
acura,mdx,2005,APildes, 02/13/2005,2004 MDX,pos,"This vehicle is spacious, extremely comfortable, has a great stereo system, and there is very little road noise. Visability all around is excellent. Pick up is good, but could be better when accelerating from a stop. The engine is more than adequate for highway driving and does not strain when going 70 mph. I am extremely happy with my MDX and would consider purchasing an MDX or an Acura car when my lease is up."
acura,mdx,2005,Jody, 02/13/2005,The BEST,pos,I Love my MDX.  Have had absolutely no trouble with it.  I don't think the interior is bland at all.  It gets the best mileage for an SUV.  I think you get the most for your money with the MDX. Love the Navi too!
acura,mdx,2005,G. Davies, 02/12/2005,MDX,pos,"I test drove a number of vehicles and did a lot of homework prior to deciding on the MDX.  I do mostly in city driving and have been amazed at the smooth, quiet, drive and supurb handling.  On the highway, it handles equally as well.  It's comfortable and provides everything I need.  I only wish I got the Navi system!!!!  Although Edmunds states the MDX is bland and ho hum, I think it's a classy and understated look of quality."
acura,mdx,2005,Lincoln Wilmot, 02/13/2005,Great Automobile,pos,"In a nutshell, this is the best value for your money out of all the SUVs I test drove. This vehicle is beautiful to look at and drive. It is the best experience I have ever had in an automobile. For the money you pay for this vehicle, everything is standard. The braking and power is unbelievable and it also has a tight turn radius. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this vehicle to anyone."
acura,mdx,2005,Texan, 02/13/2005,2005 MDX - tested better than the rest,pos,"Early days, but extremely satisfied: soft ride, good acceleration, great nav & stereo, seats all roomy and comfortable, and sits high with good view of surrounding traffic. Road tested (over 2 month period) against Lx-330, Fx-35, M-Class, VW-T and the Pilot (just see if there was a difference since everyone said it was just a Pilot - Acura is a much tighter drive, not to mention the luxury items - it is different)."
acura,mdx,2005,songbird, 02/17/2005,Satisfied,pos,"I am very, very pleased with my MDX.  It handles like a car and has great power.  I love the room that it has for my family and the interior is squite comfortable.  The third seat is a major plus that comes standard with this vehicle.  I have also been pleased with the gas mileage that I get with my MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,dl, 02/26/2005,Luxury SUV at a price,pos,"Having driven the MDX for several months, I've found it to be a wonderful experience.  I've already taken it up to Lake Tahoe several times with no problems.  It has plenty of power up the mountain with 4 power & equipment and ample braking power.  My friends are impressed with its roominess.  Being my first SUV, I looked at both the Lexus & MDX.  I chose the MDX for its 3rd row seating.  There's just so much more room on an MDX and not everything is an option. One thing to keep in mind, Acura recommends using premium gas for the MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,HappyRealtor, 03/25/2005,Outstanding SUV,pos,"Have owned this vehicle since Nov. 04 and never ONCE regretted my choice. Shopped for 6 months before deciding on the Acura MDX. As a Realtor, I drive many hours a day with clients and they absolutely rave about the ride.  Wouldn't be without the NAV system -- it's awesome and gets me out of traffic jams easily.  Comfortable, easy and fun to drive. Holds tons of cargo and the third row for seating is actually roomy enough for adults!  Only wish the gas mileage were a little better but that is typical of all SUVs. I will keep this vehicle for as long as I can."
acura,mdx,2005,Anthony, 03/29/2005,Dont get on the road with out it smile,pos,"Driving this car I found to be very reliable and surefooting.  This would be the car to drive before making any decisions on another model of SUVs.  It is not totally an off road vehicle, but capable of holding its own."
acura,mdx,2005,Great MDX, 03/29/2005,Best Mid Sized Luxury SUV Around,pos,"We have had our 05 Touring w/Nav MDX for four months now (all winter) and absolutely love it.  For all out traction in mud/snow, this one can't be beat.  Solid as a rock and have had not one single problem.  Voice activated Navigation is absolutely amazing.  Looked at the RX and X5, both were way overpriced and gas mileage was worse than MDX.  It's time for an MDX Hybrid."
acura,mdx,2005,rsl82472, 03/29/2005,love it!,pos,"I love this car and I think everyone who has one does! I love how custumizable they are, you rarely see two the same, unless they are base models with-out accessories. When people personalize their MDX generally you'll they often com up with their own combinations to creat a unique look. But surprisingly Acura doesn't offer any rim choices."
acura,mdx,2005,Bill, 04/09/2005,Great Vehicle,pos,I got a SUV for reasonas associated with a bad back.  It has proved to be much more.  The MDX is a very comfortable smooth ride with great handling.
acura,mdx,2005,ChaosMiners, 04/10/2005,Great SUV,pos,I drove this car for a week at Lake Tahoe while we were getting 9 feet of snow.  Not a hint of a handling problem even when the roads were heavily iced.  One great feature is that the driver's seat will lower to a point where you can get in and out of the car on ice without transferring all your weight when standing on ice.
acura,mdx,2005,jpinches, 04/11/2005,Luxury in a Smaller and Wide Footprint,pos,"Having driven a BMW 528 for the last three years, performance, handling and amenities were important in a SUV.  I have driven many rental SUVs and had a reference base to other SUVs to compare the MDX to. The MXD won hands down!  The 265 hp is just right for vehicles of this weight and braking is very responsive. The MXD resists body-roll in corners very well. The power lumbar support helps keep the driver in place in the seat.  The voice command Nav and Bluetooth phone link is great.  The Bose system is a 8 out ot of 10 in audio quality. Could offer more midrange control in audio setup. The MDX has already proven to me to be the best choice for my needs after only several hundred miles"
acura,mdx,2005,JimBo, 04/28/2005,Best bet for your money!,pos,"This is a great midsize luxury SUV.  Great options for your money. Costs less then the X5 and has many more options, not to mention good safety rating. Highly recommended!"
acura,mdx,2005,Paula, 05/13/2005,Love My MDX!,pos,"I appreciate the way my MDX handles.  It is as comfortable as a sedan, yet with all the added space and uses like a truck.  I am extremely pleased."
acura,mdx,2005,Stacey, 05/14/2005,Crash Tested,pos,I recently totalled my 2004 in an unavoidable accident.  The car safetly features are amazing.  Everything worked perfectly saving my and my 7 year old from serious injury!  I can say this car performed amazingly under the most important of all curcumstancies and I have orded a new 2005 to replace it!
acura,mdx,2005,WB, 05/14/2005,Great SUV,pos,"Great handling on the highway, and the rural areas where I drive.  Super Navigational system, it is easy to use.  There is a lot of leg and shoulder room in this SUV.  I have had Jeep Limited's before, and this SUV is built solid. "
acura,mdx,2005,irishwheat, 05/17/2005,Wished for More,neg,"Wished this car had been as reliable and fun to drive as other Honda products. In general, a great disappointment. Electrical problems and navigational breakdowns. AC would not shut off. In shop five times in first 7 months."
acura,mdx,2005,Massie, 06/11/2005,MDX is the best!,pos,"More than a year of research and finally decided to get the MDX. The 2005 model have almost everything I wanted in a vehicle, the voice controls, blue-tooth tech., navigation, DVD entertainment, power seats, memory, on-star, backing-up camera, rain- sensing wipers, 7-seats, AWD, blah blah blah... etc. It is worth every penny and the whole family loves this car so much."
acura,mdx,2005,Urugly, 06/12/2005,Post purchase review,pos,"I just got the touring MDX with Navi and love it to death.  I have always like this car since 01' when it came out. All the gadgets that it comes with in its class can't be beat.  Heated seats, power everything, 3rd row seating, AWD, Blue LED  interior lights, Onstar, XM, voice activated navi and control.. the list goes on...."
acura,mdx,2005,Wendy, 06/12/2005,You Gotta Get One,pos,"You must buy the Acura MDX. I really enjoy mine. I researched it for about two months before I purchased it. This was the best SUV purchased I've ever made. I have all the toys, which is standard. You will not go wrong with this purchase. I also have the Bose system and it sound GREAT! Especially with my iPod. Smooth and quiet ride."
acura,mdx,2005,Peter C, 06/15/2005,Best SUV Deal,pos,"I went from an Accord to the MDX wanting a vehicle for 4 wheel reliability & being quite pleased with Honda's workmanship. I also wanted a good deal which after studying all the other SUVs in the MDX price range, I feel I got it. It is a good looking vehicle, with good solid engine performance I am  real pleased with my MDX. "
acura,mdx,2005,DebO, 06/15/2005,Thumbs up for my MDX!,pos,"I was deciding between the MDX and the Lexus RX 330.  All the reviews, including Edmunds, seem to view the MDX as more utilitarian and less ""desirable"" than the RX.  Well, thankfully I didn't listen--I bought the MDX and I absolutely love it.  I'm so glad I decided to test drive the MDX.  Fuel economy is a little less than I expected in the summer, but a small price to pay for such an awesome SUV."
acura,mdx,2005,Shelley N, 06/26/2005,I Love My MDX,pos,I have been driving an SUV for 16 years and this is by far my favorite of the lot! I bought my 1st MDX 4 years ago when they first hit the market and I now have my 2nd. I love the look and the ride is comfortable and car like. It is totally reliable and the size is perfect for a sports Mom with 3 growing boys. I can't imagine a better SUV available in this price range! Drive one and you will be hooked   
acura,mdx,2005,Fred Miller, 06/28/2005,freddieboi,pos,"safe, solid fun to drive for an SUV, good looking, very dependable, comfortable and solid as a rock"
acura,mdx,2005,Austin Barney, 06/28/2005,Hard to beat...but for gas mileage !!,pos,"I have had my MDX for about a month... first car that ever talked back to me! I looked at MANY other cars first and think I chose the best for my needs, a combination of off road and long distance driving. The car is great in all respects but the gas mileage is atrocious!! I am getting 14.4 around town and only 18.6 on the highway ! Miserable compared to my last car, a W8 VW wagon."
acura,mdx,2005,Brenda, 06/30/2005,Happy New Owner,pos,Have researched SUVs for about 4 years and always came back to the Acura MDX as the top choice.  Purchased in 2005 and so far we have really enjoyed our MDX experience
acura,mdx,2005,Harrisburg, PA,None like it in the market...,pos,"There isn't another Lux SUV on the market that has the blend of size and utility with comfort and safety like the MDX.  Seating for 7 with safety features like Onstar and all the airbags you could ever want.  The review states that the interior is bland, but I would call it understated elegance.  Everything is where it should be and the materials (dash; seats; etc.) are all top quality.  The only things I wish it had are daytime running lights and automatic locking when placed in drive.  Overall the wife loves it (even the nav system I had to have) and the kids like being able to have their friends all in one car.  NOTE:  The MDX is due for a redesign in 2007."
acura,mdx,2005,bobfir, 07/07/2005,2nd time around,pos,When my lease came up on my 2001 MDX I looked at everything in the Luxury class and just couldn't find another car that I liked any better. As a Real Estate broker I needed a SUV that was confortable in the back as well as the front. The reclining back seats are much better than the straight up and down seating in many other models. The NAV system is the best in fuction of any I have seen. ONSTAR and XM are also a great addition to the older model. The best car I have ever had (my 2001 MDX) got better. 
acura,mdx,2005,sftonykim, 07/07/2005,COMPETITION???? NONE!!!!!!!,pos,"I just bought my 05' MDX w/NAV & DVD Ent. on 4th of July. I had and still do have Lexus 300 for the past 4 years and there's just no comparison. I wanted to buy a 7 passenger seating and was looking at Lexus  GX470 and MBZ ML500. Compared all the vehicles by its features, comfort, gadgets/technologies, options, hp, torque, styling, and value.... with two hands WAY DOWN, MDX came out ahead. There's just no way that MBZ ML500 nor Lexus GX470 could compete. Both MBZ & Lexus's rear/back passenger seats are installed on the side of the trunk space....so inconvenient!  If you want the BEST SUV, MDX is way to go. Don't even waste your time shopping around!  "
acura,mdx,2005,George Pado, 07/10/2005,a quality drive,pos,"This is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever driven.  The MDX touring package has all the bells and whistles anyone can want in an SUV. A little pricy compared to some other SUV's but well worth the money.   Acceleration is fast and smooth, with a very quiet ride. "
acura,mdx,2005,McGinnisRohe, 07/10/2005,Acura MDX,pos,Love everything about this car except the amount of wind noise on the highway.  The navigation system is by far the best in the industry.  I have friends with three other systems and they all envy this one for ease of use.
acura,mdx,2005,Kevin, 07/21/2005,MDX Overview,pos,"Good car overall, the biggest SUV size for the smallest SUV type."
acura,mdx,2005,M.Dennis McCarron, 07/26/2005,My second but hardly final MDX,pos,"The '05 MDX is a world above the '01 I had first and THAT was a great vehicle! This may not be the splashiest SUV on the lot, but it is much more quiet and nimble than any other I have owned. I think the gas mileage is fair at 20-21 mpg but sustainable for now. The turning radius still amazes me!"
acura,mdx,2005,Lynn, 07/26/2005,Great SUV!,pos,"Great SUV!  Nice size makes handling easy. Smooth driving.  Loaded with fun gadgets and entertainment. A lot of interior bang for the buck!  Kid friendly.  Easy to maneuver 3rd bench when needed.  Nice storage space. This is our fourth SUV in 10 years and is definitely my favorite.  The safety scores are good, too.  Good range of vision through windows."
acura,mdx,2005,Hangdog, 08/15/2005,A great minivan alternative,pos,"I love the seating for 7.  Driving the MDX feels like driving a car, no heavy truck feel.  I think I'll stay with this one for a while!"
acura,mdx,2005,Jackie Morehead, 08/16/2005,Nothing Else will Do,pos,"My new MDX is the best, it drives so well, turns so well, rides like a dream. I let a friend drive it and they were so impressed.  I love my On Star and Navigation they are so good and the blue tooth phone as well as the other phone.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful my new Acura MDX is. "
acura,mdx,2005,Jim Lipsky, 08/17/2005,"An ""Accurate"" Description",pos,"I'm very pleased with my Acura MDX.  I traded up from a V6 Accord Navi and haven't looked back or regretted a thing, short of filling the gas tank daily (I'm a Realtor, and put lots of miles on the car).  My invalid father gets in and out easily and clients like the roominess and Navi system.  Nice job Honda!  "
acura,mdx,2005,John, 08/18/2005,Trade up to 2005 MDX,pos,"4,000 miles of experience and still enjoy driving my MDX.  Features and comfort are better than expected, gas mileage a little worse (18 MPG).  The on board computer shows about 22 MPG best case on the freeway. The RES causes some rear visibility issues, but workable.  The ride is much better than my prior SUV (V8 Explorer) and power about the same.  As claimed, the MDX drives a lot smaller than it is, and feels very stable at all speeds.  The MDX is a perfectly balanced SUV that does just about everything well, albeit not best in class."
acura,mdx,2005,carol, 08/27/2005,for moms who refuse to do the minivan,pos,"This car is feels custom made for our family of 5 plus 2 large dogs.  The seating options work out perfectly for us.  I love having 2 ""extra"" kid seats in row 3 for the kids' friends or for when my own lovely children need to be separated.  And the front seat airbag sensor means I feel more confident when my older children sit up front. In truth, we should have a minivan -- that is the ultimate in convenience for a motley crew like us.  BUT my final rationalization for the MDX was that when it was time for my oldest to start driving that this would become her car.  I'm sure she'll be much happier inheriting the MDX than a minivan!!!"
acura,mdx,2005,flajcat, 08/31/2005,Good Investment,pos,"My wife has a 2002 MDX and because of the performance, quality, craftsmanship, I decided to buy a 2005 MDX.  Way above average resale value.  No problems in 3 years, excellent quality.  The back up camera adds to safety.  There are 8 airbags, high quality interior.  Very good engine performance.  Luxurious inside.  Navigation system is a 10.  Mediocre gas mileage.  I am getting about 18 combined highway and city.  "
acura,mdx,2005,mna, 09/13/2005,Fun to drive long distances,pos,I drove in the middle of winter thru snow and mud long distances. It was a very comfortable ride and drive. It is a smooth running suv and drives like a car. 
acura,mdx,2005,Gills Family, 09/27/2005,Excellent Family Vehicle,pos,This is my 4th owned Acura and this MDX doesn't disappoint.  It has a car-like ride which we like and the engineering and technology is well worth the price which we found reasonable for a Luxury vehicle.   Acura service is outstanding and we are looking forward to enjoying our retirement vehicle. The MDX is not just a vehicle but a solution to our transportation problems. 
acura,mdx,2005,HappyTourer, 09/27/2005,MDX is Great!,pos,"Looked at Lexus RX330 and Toyota 4- Runner but Acura won out with best design and ease of use.  Mileage has been as expected about 19 mixed use so far, but better than the old 4-Runner with 150HP.  Power is excellent.  We added rear body-colored wing which makes it look even better.  Hard to believe the MDX is still somewhat hard to come by after 5 years on the market.  I still own a '91 Legend Coupe and cannot bear the thought of parting with it.  Had no problem trading off the 4-Runner, though."
acura,mdx,2005,Jim, 09/28/2005,Acura MDX,pos,Everything is great but the GAS mileage. Only average 17mpg. Less than I expected.
acura,mdx,2005,Tay, 10/22/2005,Not disappointed,pos,"For 1 whole year, I researched and test drove SUVS from Lexus, Infiniti, Jeep, BMW, Volkswagon, and a few others as well as the MDX. I loved the MDX from the moment I drove it, and now that I own one, I love it even more.  The MDX is fun to drive, loaded with many luxuries and comforts, has great power (Awesome pickup), great sound system, and in my opinion the best Navigation system of any car I drove. Add to that, this is dollar for dollar one of the best deals out there, and it's also one of the most dependable Mid-SUVs out there, this is one really amazing vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,wm stiehm, 01/02/2006,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"The MDX is superior in all respects for an SUV.  Although the total weight didn't push the specs, I towed a 1100 lb boat and 400 lb trailer 1800 miles with ease and with a feeling of control at all times.  This included driving the mountains of NC and NY.  Its third seat is handy and I love its muscular look (compare to sister vehicle, the Honda Pilot)."
acura,mdx,2005,Suzanne, 01/08/2006,I Love My MDX,pos,"I have driven a minivan for years and this is my first SUV. We went with the MDX after test driving BMW,Lexus,Volvo. I was not impressed until I drove my Acura!  Main reason I chose it..Cargo room, and 3rd row seat is big enough for me or my 17 y/o son! Best of all were the safety rateings.  My MDX gets alomost 19mi/per gallon! Don't think that's bad for a 6cyl.  Heck I only got 14-16 with my minivan!  Wonderful ride in town or longer trips.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for room, safety and looks!"
acura,mdx,2005,Paul Marsteller, 01/24/2006,Downsized for mileage but not so good...,pos,"Maybe I am not a mid-size SUV kind of person, having driven something much bigger for years. To save on guess I talked myself into this car, liking it better than the competition.  After 4 months I continue to be underwhelmed and am thinking of trading for a Seqioa.  I don't recommend this to anyone used to a bigger SUV who is just downsizing for the better mileage.  I'm getting about 17-19 mpg(70/30 hwy/city). Pluses:  Good navigation system.  Cons: Where to begin? Clunky and noisy over little bumps; lackluster hwy acceleration; inside windshield steams up ALL the time (never had this problem before; and I live in San Diego!); Sun seems to shine in too much; stiff to shift.. tra"
acura,mdx,2005,Bob, 02/04/2006,Safety,pos,We have owned this truck for about 6 months and have been about 95% happy with our purchase.  Owned several S U vehicles and this one outdrives them all by a long shot.  Often have 5 people in the vehicle and it's very comfortable.  
acura,mdx,2005,DK, 02/05/2006,This SUV rocks!!!,pos,"I decided go for this MDX because it has 7 seats, better values and excellent ride quality. It is wider than RX330 and comes with all the standrad features. However, I got around 15-19 mile per gallon with premium gas, it is not cheap!!! "
acura,mdx,2005,Nv, 02/06/2006,I love my MDX!,pos,"I enjoy the smooth ride and the technology advanced features.  I got all Navi and RES on my MDX because I didn't want buyers remorse.  And, I must say it's worth it.  I've had mine since Aug 05 and love it.  Navi has been reliable when I input addresses, but not as reliable with directory assistance."
acura,mdx,2005,Nice Ride, 02/26/2006,Love it,pos,"Went from a Toyota Camry XLS to the MDX since we have a toddler and another on the way.  Drives like a car, very smooth.  Comes standard with sunroof, heated seats, third row.  Has alot to offer."
acura,mdx,2005,ELC, 02/28/2006,Always Room for Improvement,pos,"Overall, this is a great vehicle.  The comfort and features are fantastic, but the handling could be better.  My engine sometimes ""jumps"" during quick acceleration and the vehicle does NOT inspire confidence during sudden/emergency braking.  I love the Navi system, but the voice control is horrible -- it never recognizes what we say, so we just use the touch screen.  On the positive side, the MDX is very roomy and comfortable, and the Bose sound system rocks.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Hecyes, 03/25/2006,MDX delivers,pos,"I've driven the MDX for over a year now and am very satisfied with its performance, driveability, and dependability. Its not as comfortable as the Lexus but you get a lot more for the price. The navigation system is amazing and the mileage you get is very good. I like the looks of it much better that the others in this price range...sleek and clean."
acura,mdx,2005,Tom, 06/05/2006,I actually don't mind making my payments,pos,"I'm not particularly a car person, but I have to say I really like this SUV. It's my first Acura and my 5th SUV.   It's very quiet, spacious, comfortable, and the navigation is fantastic once you learn commands. (At first I didn't think the voice rec. worked well but it was mostly my lack of understanding it. Fine now.) Body style is least favorate but added wheel flares, side molding, and running boards that help make it less bulbous."
acura,mdx,2005,Brandi, 07/25/2006,I Love It!!,pos,I love my MDX as much today as the day I bought it.  It drives like a dream and is very roomy.  Just last weekend we took 6 adults over 3 hours drive away with luggage and everyone had plenty of room.  Now if only they would come out with a hybrid with the new models...
acura,mdx,2005,rob2xmdxbuyer, 10/27/2004,Second time around,pos,"This is my second MDX and I love it 
more than the first one(2001) I had to 
wait 3 months for the first one and it 
was well worth it. The 2005 model is a 
great improvement. More power, 
comfort , options and its even quieter.

Hip, Hip huray for acura. and a 
special thanks to Rob at Paragon Acura 
for the great service."
acura,mdx,2005,outuvtime, 11/03/2004,Best choice in mid-size luxury SUVs,pos,"Great ride; rides like a comfy car and 
handles well also.

Gas mileage is lower than expected but 
that will hopefully get better as the 
engine break-in period elapses. "
acura,mdx,2005,lvernacc, 11/06/2004,I love my MDX,pos,"I purchased my MDX in May 2004.  This 
is the best vehicle I have ever driven. 
I researched other comparable vehicles 
as Lexus, Toyota, BMW and Volvo.  The 
MDX was not only the best value, but 
has the best ride."
acura,mdx,2005,luckyd, 11/09/2004,1st time MDX buyer,pos,"I compared the 05 MDX with the RX330.  
I ultimately purchased the MDX based 
on the value for the price.  I love 
the voice command system, still trying 
to learn the commands.  The ride is 
smooth for an SUV, nice acceleration, 
quite interior, & clean console 
setup.  I like the clean integration 
of the front radio with the dvd system.
The MDX was much larger than the RX330."
acura,mdx,2005,jhmdds, 11/08/2004,MDX,pos,"This is my second MDX and third Acura.  
When its time for service, my salesman 
picks up my MDX at work and leaves me 
his car for the day. I've never had a 
minute's problem.  These are great 
vehicles."
acura,mdx,2005,mark martin, 11/09/2004,2005 better than 2003,pos,"Had 2003 updated to 2005 the nav is 
great improvement and the voice 
activated features are a nice addition"
acura,mdx,2005,lbelle, 11/09/2004,'05 MDX,pos,"A very solid car. Acura has gone to 
great lengths to correct some of the 
problems of the more recent models such 
as the gas tank slosh and the brake 
clunking. The new acoustic lining has 
done wonders to mitigate noise. This is 
one silent and solid vehicle. Leather 
appears improved over prior models as 
well. "
acura,mdx,2005,Albert Chamakala, 11/08/2004,Most adventurous vehicle,pos,"This is the most funnest car to drive 
on and off road. It has good mileage 
but at the same time a real nice pick 
up time from 0-60. Its great for all my 
needs. The only thing that to my 
disliking is the shape of the front of 
the mdx. It has an angular front and 
I'd like it to be more flat."
acura,mdx,2005,sguinan887, 11/05/2004,acura mdx,pos,"this is an excellent riding and 
handling car. 
fun to drive and so far very reliable, 
the reason we bought it."
acura,mdx,2005,dmdm, 11/14/2004,We Love It,pos,"Decided to abandon the minivan this time around 
for something a bit sportier but with the same 
seating capacity as the van.  I cannot say enough 
good things about our MDX.  It handles much nicer 
than the other SUVs on our shopping list (feels like 
driving a sedan not a truck).  The interior is  very 
well done and we love the new exterior color Steel 
Blue Metalic.  Gas mileage could be better, but we 
expect it to get better as it breaks in.  Great choice!"
acura,mdx,2005,psr, 11/14/2004,2004 MDX Touring Review,pos,"This vehicle has the quality, size 
(interior,exterior)appropriate for most 
buyers. We have this SUV and a 2002 
Mercedes sedan. The MDX is the 
preferred transportation."
acura,mdx,2005,DRTur, 11/16/2004,MDX = Value SUV,pos,"Incredible value - feature, performance 
vs. price.  Acura reliability"
acura,mdx,2005,mell, 11/16/2004,great car!,pos,"very fun to drive, the dvd player is 
very nice. very roomy 2nd and 3rd row 
seating, fits 7 passengers comfortabley 
or TONS of cargo. navigation system is 
VERY helpful. very comfortable ride.. 
but it is a gas hog. goes good in snow 
and ice."
acura,mdx,2005,Edgardo, 11/16/2004,M D X,pos,"This is a great every day car, high, 
responsive and safe. 
3rd seat is great if you need it, but 
you are taking away confort in the 2nd 
seats. 
Navigation system is awesome, worth the 
extra money and so is the quality  of 
sound. "
acura,mdx,2005,Gotcha, 11/28/2004,Acura 2004 base model,pos,"Excellent.  Everything I wanted except 
good gas mileage!!!  Great value for 
all that is included and great 
performance."
acura,mdx,2005,andygs400, 11/27/2004,Wonderful car... but not perfect,pos,"I have only had this car for a couple 
weeks now, but I absolutely love it.  
It definitely has its shortcomings, 
but the car as a whole makes up for 
it.  Drove it from Phoenix to LA and 
back and I was never more 
comfortable.  Great blend of utility 
and luxury.  I would definitely get 
the Touring package because the little 
luxuries are great."
acura,mdx,2005,cdepaola, 12/08/2004,Looked at them all Acura best in class!!,pos,"We looked at and test drove all of the 
other midsized SUV's in the Acura MDX's 
class. We found the best deal and the 
best car to be the Acura. Fit was 
great, and we felt it looked to be the 
most upscale interior and exterior. "
acura,mdx,2005,Brandi, 12/15/2004,What a car!!,pos,"After test-driving 15+ different SUV's, 
the Acura won out. We seriously looked 
at the Lexus but with only 5 seats, it 
wasn't large enough for the option of 
my children's friends accompanying us 
anywhere. The navigation system is 
awesome, and a lot of fun to use. The 
reverse camera is very useful, although 
you can be fooled with the scale of it 
(everything looks far away). You can 
get spoiled with the automatic wipers, 
speeding up/slowing down as needed. 
Very useful for city driving. The Bose 
sound system is awesome. The 
entertainment system displays the XM 
songs and artists on the screen, which 
the children have been having a lot of 
fun with. I can't gush enough - I love 
this car!!!!!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2005,Aaron, 12/19/2004,Great value,pos,"Hands down the best automobile I've 
owned. Did lots of research on SUV's 
before deciding on the MDX, and so far 
I haven't been sorry with my decision. 
great zip, room for 7, and the 
Navigation system that never ceases to 
amaze. Awesome sound system; rear DVD 
a must have for those with kids. 
Incredible number of features for the 
money. Very refined car, with the 
quality of Honda to back it up. Every 
control right where it's supposed to 
be - when you get into the drivers 
seat of this vehicle, you'll feel 
right at home!"
acura,mdx,2005,Jimbo, 12/20/2004,"Fun car, but...",pos,"Very smooth ride in comparison to my two
prior Ford Explorers.  Enjoy the nav
system however still learning commands
and touch screen can be hard to not make
mistakes.  A heating problem has
developed in our car, and the same issue
with a neighbor who has the same car. 
The local dealer is stumped.  Not a good
feature in the winter.  Other than this
the car is great."
acura,mdx,2005,George, 12/26/2004,MDX Review,pos,"Car is quieter and rides better than I 
thought it would.  New blue metallic 
color looks really great.  This is 
truly a very high quality car.  Also 
has storage compartment under floor in 
cargo area and many handy storage bins 
throughout passenger area."
acura,mdx,2005,kevinmak, 12/30/2004,Our top choice Luxury SUV,pos,"After owning 2 Nissan Pathfinders, a 
Ford Explorer, and a Mitsubishi 
Montero, it was time to step up to a 
Luxury SUV.  I had never considered the 
Acura a serious contender, leaning more 
towards the Volvo or Lexus... but after 
driving them all, there's no doubt that 
this is the best choice for the money.  
Hands down more bang for your buck than 
the Lexus (although it was a strong 
contender) and certainly capable of 
keeping us as happy as the Volvo while 
saving $7500 comparably equipped... 
this is a great vehicle.  I agree with 
the editor's review, a little ""bland"", 
but when you want a luxury SUX and 
you're in the $40k budget - I'd highly 
recommend the MDX!  What a dream to 
drive!"
acura,mdx,2005,Christine Spampinato, 01/02/2005,Comfort in driving,pos,"I love driving my MDX. It is a smooth 
and comfortable SUV. It has power to 
get you where you want to go. The 
visiblity is also great.I am able to 
see a lot more of the country side than 
with my sedan. I also like the seat 
warmer during this winter season. Over 
all it is a great SUV for the price. "
acura,mdx,2005,Deborah, 01/03/2005,Great choice,pos,"This is a great choice.  The engine is 
seemless, you do not feel it shifting 
like some other luxury SUV's I test 
drove.  Living near the mountains the 
power and engine is great, such a 
smooth ride.  The size is great since I 
did not want a huge SUV.  Love that it 
is ULEV2, which most SUV's are not."
acura,mdx,2005,Driving a Cayenne S, 01/06/2005,Very disappointed,neg,"Extremely disappointed in the product. 
Expected more pickup and much better 
gasoline economy due to 6 cylinders. "
acura,mdx,2005,GMSUSIE, 01/06/2005,Great Choice!,pos,"I have had this car for two months -- I 
have enjoyed every driving experience 
with it.  It is comfortable -- it feels 
like a true ""luxury"" car.  The 
navigation system and satellite radio 
are pluses.  The gas mileage isn't 
great, but I do drive it ""around town"" 
a lot of the time which doesn't help 
much.  We tried out ""all"" of the suvs 
and are so pleased that this is the one 
we chose."
acura,mdx,2005,guye, 01/06/2005,I love it,pos,"Just converted from a long run of Volvo 
sedans and I love it. Gas mileage isn't 
great but not much different than other 
SUV's. "
acura,mdx,2005,Dan Lanza, 01/16/2005,My first Acura experience,pos,"So far so good. This is a very nice 
upgrade from my previous vehicle
(RAV4L). The voice activated Navigation 
is worth every penny. I will report 
back in about 6 months."
acura,mdx,2005,George, 01/16/2005,Truly Satisfied,pos,"What a truck!  I only wish I could get 
car fuel economny!  A joy to drive with 
little maintenance cost.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Nicolo, 01/21/2005,Good SUV made better,pos,"Traded '03 for '05 touring with Nav.  
The new car is better in every way, 
quieter, quicker and with better body 
integrity.  List of additional 
features compared to the '03 is very 
long: side curtain air bags, power 
lumbar, built in XM, better nav, voice 
commands for nearly everything, better 
dashboard display, better audio, six 
disc dash CD, bluetooth, Onstar, 
bigger gas tank.  The Japanese, unlike 
American manufacturers, listen to 
consumers and make continuing 
updates.  "
acura,mdx,2005,cperry, 01/27/2005,Excellent vehicle,pos,"This vehicle drives great and comfort 
is unbelievable.  We have had over 2 
feet of snow and we haven't had any 
problems getting around"
acura,mdx,2005,seanandre, 01/26/2005,"Great car, keep those PINs!!",pos,"Bought it b/c baby on the way. Yeah, 
car was working perfectly. Interior 
light left on drained battery, got a 
jump... Need the pin numbers for both 
radio and nav to start working again. 
Had incorrect pin for nav, cost 90 
bucks to pull system out and ref serial 
number in database... If you buy car 
used (like us) get those correct pins 
AND serial numbers. Car is great other 
than that, we live in DC, the nav 
system is awesome and a must, much 
better than BMW, space is great (been 
remodeling condo and moving furniture). 
Gas milage from 15-24mpg depending on 
city/hwy. Not a hardcore 4x4, but just 
snowed and we never felt the vehicle 
lose ground on hills or get bogged 
down, just powered on through"
acura,mdx,2005,Bart, 01/28/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Very fun to drive in comparison to my
prior Land Cruiser. Handles the road,
curves and all, very nimbly. Touch
screen controls somewhat cumbersome to
use while driving."
acura,mdx,2005,moxnix1, 01/28/2005,Low quality control,pos,"Fun to drive, very responsive 
handling. Fuel economy is 
disappointing. Nav system and touch 
screen controls locked up when car was 
only a few weeks old. Temp control on 
heater has never worked properly and 
seatbelt sensor for passenger seat 
doesn't work. Other than that I love 
the car."
acura,mdx,2005,BarryD, 02/08/2005,Great SUV,pos,"This is a great SUV for the money.  It handles well and its comfortable.  With the spoiler on the rear door and some side steps, it also looks sportier than other SUVs. I was looking for a larger car, but found that the MDX is more comfortable than many expensive sedans, handles well and the electronics are great. "
acura,mdx,2005,Mary Ann Moss, 02/09/2005,Performance and comfort,pos,"I find the ride of the mdx to be smooth and comfortable.  Interior is roomy and stylish with extra's that I expect out of a luxury suv.  gas mileage is usually 20 to 21 miles per gallon for me.  That is good for this size vehicle. it's not hard to get in and out of (not to high, not to low).  If Acura wants any suggtions, the only thing is, I feel like for the price they should have added more wood grain to interior, such as the steering wheel and control panel.  This should have been standard the the touring package."
acura,mdx,2005,rugrats, 02/10/2005,Smooth rider,pos,"At first, I felt that it was big for me to drive, but then when I got used to it, I honestly prefer to drive my Acura MDX instead of Honda Accord/ Coupe.  What I like about this car it is very quiet and runs really smooth. I am very happy that we had selected this vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2005,Heli Bassham, 02/10/2005,Great car in more way than one.,pos,I have been driving several luxury cars in the past and I have never like any of them as much as I love my MDX. This car is just awsome. So much space and it drives so smooth handles great in the snow and rain. It is just a wonderful car. Thank you Acura for making it.
acura,mdx,2005,Chicago Rich, 02/21/2005,Excellent Vehicle,pos,"This vehicle is outstanding.  Everyday I drive it, I find new conveniences.  I've owned several SUVs including the BMW, Lexus LX470, and Dodge Durango.  This one takes the cake.  It is larger on the inside that it looks, and the car is smooth with no problems.  I am frugal in my praise, which has led two friends to also purchase the vehicle.  Great for families and excellent in the Chicago snow."
acura,mdx,2005,dsp888, 02/25/2005,Early Review,pos,"Only a month old but a great first impression. I was afraid going to a 6 from a Jeep V8 but this MDX has plenty to torque in all ranges yet cruises at 1500 to 2000 RPM.  Easy to drive with great handling and fantastic brakes. Sits a little highter than I am used to, and is larger overall - but the interior room is enormous and the rear camera on the Touring is to die for. While test driving I really spanked it in an empty parking lot and was impressed with the total stability. Lets see what the future brings."
acura,mdx,2005,Carole Matter, 03/08/2005,Awesome SUV,pos,"This is the best vehicle I've ever owned!  There is not a single thing I wish it had that it doesn't have.  It's the perfect vehicle--comfortable for lots of passengers when the extended family visits, or plenty of space to do major hauls of office supplies, etc.  It does everything you could want with perfection.  It handles like a dream--powerful, responsive, hugs the road, great visibility all the way around, and luxurious.  Comfortable for  long trips, and no more need to figure out your route to a place you've never been before--the navigation system will find your way and tell you every turn of he way.  It's absolutely awesome ine very way!  I LOVE my MDX!"
acura,mdx,2005,robert dinezza, 03/09/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Vehicle rides outstanding in all conditions. easy manuevering in city. Good gas mileage. Great in rain, snow or ice."
acura,mdx,2005,bothell bill, 03/12/2005,Pain in the rear,pos,"Have owned my 2004 for 7 months and finally took it on a long cruise in Feb.  A 4 hour ride. After 2 1/2 hours my butt started going numb and then legs.  I think due to design of seat bottom.  It tapers radically towards where the seat back joins and the angled sides of the seat bottom press into the nevers of my butt. I'm 5'10"" and 185 lbs with 35"" waist.  I did the same cruise the first of March with the same result.  I took a friend with me the second trip and he experienced the same discomfort.  If you plan on long cruises, that a second look.  What about a four hour test drive??"
acura,mdx,2005,Chiefton, 03/15/2005,Great Ride,pos,I have had this car for a couple months now it is had been great so far.  I am very pleased.
acura,mdx,2005,Quest Fan, 03/15/2005,Fun to Drive,pos,"After going through some more expensive SUV's, I settled for the MDX.  Has more seating capacity than the RX330 or ML320 at a much lower price.  Love the way they package the vehicle so you dont have to mix and match like other vehicles."
acura,mdx,2005,PhoenixSun, 03/22/2005,Luxurious and Practical,pos,"Researched many comparable SUVs and selected the Acura MDX Touring Edition (Silver w/ Quartz interior). After 2 weeks, I've been very pleased with the performance, comfort and features. Great on the open highway, as well as on unpaved roads. Still brand new, but averaging about 18-19 miles to the gallon. The MDX does take premium gas, which is a bit more painful these days of high gas prices. Was able to purchase the vehicle for $500.00 over invoice and that was with body-side moldings also added."
acura,mdx,2005,RedSox18, 04/02/2005,2005 MDX Premium,pos,"I have had Hondas for 15 years and have owned two CRV's during that time.  This Acura was a bit of a splurge for me, but I felt it was a step above the Honda Pilot, offering a solid, quality vehicle with a little more luxury, comfort and style.  I spend a couple of hours per day in my car, so I am pleased with the purchase so far.  I have two kids, and the MDX comes standard with side curtain airbags, which the Pilot does not. So far, I am impressed with the MDX and the smooth ride and responsive handling. It handles well in rain and snow, and hugs dry pavement much better than my small SUVs. Highly recommend this quality vehicle.  Loads of room, too!"
acura,mdx,2005,jsa, 04/05/2005,Better than average crossover suv,pos,"We looked at the all-too-vanilla Honda Pilot for while, but we decided that it was so Honda that we couldn't bring ourselves to buy one. The MDX is a good compromise between blah and full-blown luxury. The ext. styling leaves something to be desired,but the versatility of the interior is what sold us over the Lexus RX330. We carry anything and everything in the MDX. Acura could do much better by adding the basic $38k items like daytime lights, seat memory and auto wipers. Ride is ultra smooth and quiet. Plenty of power and nicely appointed inside. A bit pricey for what it is though. Add auto-locking doors and power pass. seat to up the sense of value!"
acura,mdx,2005,Dan-Florida, 04/07/2005,You'll Love it,pos,"I did an extensive research for almost two months in the mid-size suv market and never found anything that compared to the MDX.  If you're looking in the 35k to 40k price range, make sure you check out the MDX.  I had an Expedition for 5 years and this feels just as big inside, which I did not expect.  I love the ride and the feel on the road and you will too."
acura,mdx,2005,Ed Bongart, 04/21/2005,Fun in my SUV,pos,Love driving the SUV and the satellite radio is great!
acura,mdx,2005,united_airline, 04/23/2005,7 passengers and no sweat !!!,pos,"I was very impressed with my 04 Acura MDX touring, navi. I had 7 adults and this baby climbs hill like I was sitting alone by myself. I don't have to add additional gas. I did not hear the engine make any noises when going up hill. It is truly remarkable."
acura,mdx,2005,ctmcsss, 04/27/2005,We love this SUV,pos,"We love the interior space.  We took 6 people and 6 pieces of luggage and 6 carry-ons to the airport with no problem.  This SUV is fun to drive.  It will give you a confident feeling in the rain, snow, and ice.  After comparing price, interior layout, and comfort to drive we couldn't find a better SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Max, 05/08/2005,Balanced Luxury Utility Vehicle,pos,"My wife and I looked at several luxury and non-luxury 7-passenger SUVs.  The list included the Toyota Highlander, Cadillac SRX, Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, Mercedes ML, and more.  The SRX was the most fun to drive, but the XC90 had more safety features.  The ML had the best ""luxury"" interior, but the Highlander and Pilot were all priced considerably less.  Well, the MDX has more HP than the SRX, is second in crash tests to only the XC90, has better reliability than the Benz, and is more prestigious than a Toyota and Honda combined. Winning combination in our book!"
acura,mdx,2005,Michael, 06/03/2005,Overall a great vehicle,pos,"Looked at Pilot, Lexus 330, Volvo X90, BMW X5 and decided on MDX due to Acura reliability, safety, price and engine.  Pilot too bland, Lexus not enough storage, Volvo did not like turbo charged engine and price and BMW not enough storage, price and reliabuility. Have 7,500 miles and so far AOK."
acura,mdx,2005,lztucker, 06/19/2005,mdx is my 4th acura--great car,pos,grandkids love the entertainment center. we love the navigation system.  only complaint is back tail door-- not real easy to shut with one hand.. wish there was an automatic closer
acura,mdx,2005,Gene, 06/20/2005,"A Fine SUV, this MDX!",pos,"We have a 3 1/2 year, 84000 mile lease on a 2005 MDX, and more than half way through the first year, I am not disappointed.  I love how accura's navigation gets me there, even though I do not understand why the ""now time traffic conditions"" unit found in the  RL Sedan is not even an option. But let's not be picky.  This SUV is a dream to drive ON the road--I would not go to the beach or offroad with it. If you do not need the biggest SUV on the planet, this will satisfy.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Bill1701d, 06/22/2005,MDX - fun and efficient,pos,"This is my first SUV and it is a fun car to drive.  It also has great safety features and ample room although the third row has very tight leg room.  It's cargo space is excellent with the third row seating down and adequate when up.  The drive is firm but smooth and holds the road well.  I just bought the car so these are initial reactions, but I have a feeling this will be a vehicle that will hold up through the years nicely."
acura,mdx,2005,Carr, 06/22/2005,The best of the best,pos,This is one of if not the best car we have ever owned and that includes Mercedes.  The navigator is a real joy on trips or just around the area. The quality is top notch and it is so very nice to drive. Gas mileage on trips has been 24 mpg and around town around 20. The acceleration is a little slower than some cars such as entering the freeway but in all other respects this is just the best of the best!
acura,mdx,2005,dan, 06/22/2005,First Acura purchase,pos,"Traded a 2003 LS 430 for this vehicle in order to secure the third row of seating.  Ride not up to Lexus standards; however, all other features measure up and the value in relation to the SUV's from Lexus provided the decision to go with this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,apj9319, 07/13/2005,New Acura MDX purchase,pos,"Bought it for my wife after testdriving and researching ML350 (2006), X5 3.0, RX330 and LR3 V8. Best value for money in the segment. Although the interior quality, fit/finish and ""status factor"" is obviously inferior to others in the class and so also is the ride quality, it's a compromise worth making in the light of better acceleration (especially in the passing range) than the others, initial cost for comparably equipped models, projected 5 year cost of ownership, reliability and versatility. "
acura,mdx,2005,jim, 07/17/2005,great car on the road,pos,one of the reasons I chose the MDX was its ability to be towed all wheels down behind a motorhome. I have found the MDX to be a wonderful vehicle for this purpose atop all of the wonderful features it posseses as a staandard road MPV.
acura,mdx,2005,BHM, 07/17/2005,B's MDX,pos,I owned an '02 MDX and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I moved up the the '05 and it is more advanced thatn the '02 with the talk to it feature. 
acura,mdx,2005,RLPoloGuy4U, 07/18/2005,"Fun SUV, Nice Looking, Missing a little",pos,This is a great little SUV. It has several nice features however it is missing a few basic features. Only the drivers window is auto up/down and the sunroof is NOT auto either.  Gas mileage is not as good as I would have expected. Overall I am extremely happy with this SUV.  Acura offers the best SUV with the most options in it's class.  Much better than the X5 and not as regular as the Lexus.  A great buy if you are in the market!
acura,mdx,2005,Mike cinti, 07/20/2005,Solid SUV,pos,"great experience buying, solid ride.  Very fast and comfortable."
acura,mdx,2005,John, 07/30/2005,There's none greater..,pos,"This is my first suv, and third honda made auto (still have Honda my Accord ex 03).  And I couldn't think of owning two cars without  at leaset one of them being a Honda made vehicle.  My MDX is fully loaded and rides like a dream I tell you.  I from Queens NY, so who cares about going off road...?  And In the city we don't use our suvs for tow.  So with that said, my MDX has never let me down, in any shape form or fashion. It is more comfortable than many more expensive sport utes in its class.  And need I mention all of the standard equipment that comes with it...?  I know that when I'm ready to trade-in this badboy, I'm getting another-maybe the new RDX.. Hmmm..  We'll see. "
acura,mdx,2005,Alex, 08/02/2005,Smooth and Quiet,pos,"I bought my wife a 2005 MDX/ Fully loaded for xmas 2004.  We love it.  It's a little pricey fully loaded for the average family, but we believe it's well worth the extra money.  Its very quiet and has more power than anything we've driven.  In fact, we have driven interstate 80 through snow, steep grades, thunderstorms, hot summer traffic, ect..  and have been VERY pleased.  We test drove the Lexus GX470 and although you can't compair to the comfort and finish of a Lexus, the MDX drives with more confidence: better exceleration, better brakes, better seating layout, and just a better feel in day to day driving conditions.    "
acura,mdx,2005,Goulet, 08/04/2005,Acura Tops (AGAIN!),pos,"I traded out of a '97 CL to the '04 MDX and couldn't be happier.  Although it was a sad day, it was a happy day also.  Recently drove to NC from MA for the US Open and it was a most pleasant drive.  Navigation system helped us avoid all the DC traffic on our non-stop trip home.  The auxillary hook ups in the rear allow for a iPod to be installed and played continuously for hours (miles).  Love my MDX, just wish that there was a way to get a upgrade to get the bluetooth tecnology installed in the '04.  Currently don't know of this being available, but other than that, it's a GREAT CAR.  I'm an Acura man for LIFE!"
acura,mdx,2005,Wade, 08/03/2005,ACURA MDX TOURING w/NAVI,pos,"This is a nice looking vehicle, the navigation system is by far the best in the industry.  It is a better value for the money than other luxury SUV's.  The interior styling is kinda cheap looking with the fake wood grain.  If you need headroom this is not the vehicle for you.  Can not believe I had to order and pay for body side mouldings extra.  If you tow anything over 4,500 pounds you will not be able to do it with the MDX.  Would love to see Acura offer chrome wheels, would look so much better than the standard alloy, looks weird since the door handles are chrome."
acura,mdx,2005,June, 08/09/2005,Wonderful SUV.,pos,"This is the best car we have ever owned (touring & Navi.)! MDX improved a lot from 2001 to 2005 model and I am glad that we waited this long.  Although redesign is expected in late 2006, current model has been polished so much. MDX is the best combination of utility, reliability, and comfort compare to other upscale SUVs, I believe.  We will be keeping our MDX for a long time.    "
acura,mdx,2005,KeithK, 08/18/2005,Very Satisfied,pos,"My MDX has been fantastic so far - a great family car.  I've averaged 20 mpg (on mostly highway driving), which is a bit higher than I expected.  Acceleration is quite good, and the car is really comfortable.  Good cupholders, radio reception (things that are more important than you think)."
acura,mdx,2005,baradlee, 08/21/2005,I like it.,pos,"Nothing really to complain about except..GAS MILEAGE. In Southern California, in stop and go driving, 13.8 mpg. On the highway to Wyoming I did get 24 mpg. The V-6 has to move a lot of mass and I guess the gas mileage suffers."
acura,mdx,2005,barry, 09/02/2005,"Happy with MDX , But Not Mileage",pos,"Overall I am quite happy with my MDX.  More fun to drive than my other car, Audi A8.  Incredibly roomy inside, especially the cargo area for an SUV that is not that big on the outide.  Stereo sounds great.  Have not had any big problem with the brakes, except a little slow/sloppy when fully loaded with 5 people and a load of cargo.  Big disappointment is gas mileage.  One of the reasons I bought the MDX is because I wanted better gas mileage than my previous guzzling LX470 - but mileage is way below advertised, and not much better than the much bigger and heavier V8 powered LX470.  Nav system also disappointing. Interior quality also a bit chintzy for an expensive car."
acura,mdx,2005,left1, 09/03/2005,Great Decision,pos,Before deciding on the MDX we checked out a lot of SUVs.  What sold us was the Honda/Acura quality and dependablity as well as the feel of this SUV. We have had 9 Honda/Acura products and this one is great! Handles better than a lot of cars and rides better than most as well.  We took it on a 12 hour trip and were very pleased. We have not had any problems with the MDX. The longer we have this SUV the more we like it!
acura,mdx,2005,Hunter, 09/08/2005,You can't go wrong.,pos,"It's all included. When comparing to the others, consider total cost. Moonroof, heated, 8 way pwr seats, inter. wipers,  XM radio, OnStar, leather, memory seats/mirrors...it's all included in the Touring pkg. Nav is great AND Nav gives you back-up camera. Engine is quiet, smooth, tranny is seamless, and the confidence in high- speed interstate ramp turns and winding roads is fantastic - just a terrific stance. Good sight lines. It's not a drop-dead 'head- turner', but that's the Acura conservative style. The up-side is that everything is solid and proven before it goes into the car. The ""A"" badge does draw some 'ohhhhhhhhhs'. (Try the gold badges). "
acura,mdx,2005,John, 10/03/2005,The best for the money,pos,Great car especially for the price.  Extremely smooth transmission and very powerful 6 cylinder engine.  Very quiet cabin.  Handles like a car!
acura,mdx,2005,dhk, 10/04/2005,All-around best performer,pos,"After doing a thorough research, we settled on MDX and have not been disappointed.  This car does not do any one thing better than the competitors; Lexus has a slightly comfier interior; VW may have better off-road capability.  But the entire package is better than the competition.  Room for seven; Acura workmanship; lots and lots of power; and fair pricing.  We love than Acura won't nickel and dime you for features such as leather seating and moonroof. Everything comes standard.  The only negative - and it comes with the territory - is the gas mileage, though it is better than most SUVs.  "
acura,mdx,2005,gino mallamaci, 10/05/2005,perfect family suv,pos,a real pleasure to drive
acura,mdx,2005,Natalia, 10/15/2005,Best car I ever drove,pos," I love it! It could use better gas mileage. Very good on handling wet roads, turns.  Very smooth and quiet ride.  I did not think I would use Navigation system, but I was wrong.  It is very helpful, plus I am still learning about the vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,Pawel, 11/13/2005,Luxury SUV for a great value,pos,"Great overall SUV The breaking is very responsive and very solid, acceleration very quiet and smooth. Handling is great! "
acura,mdx,2005,Nancy, 11/16/2005,Great SUV,pos,"I test drove the Volvo and Toyota Sequoia, and my husband has the Lexus 330.  The MDX is superior to all of three.  Great handling, relatively high off the ground, comfortable interior, easy to use navigation and dvd systems.  "
acura,mdx,2005,meileen, 12/19/2005,Love my MDX,pos,"I enjoy the handling, the style and the comfort.  It has been my favorite car purchase.  Used to drive a Ford Expedition and this by far handles better.  The service I get w/ Acura has been outstanding.  Only one change, wish it had a little more storage hiding space near the driver . "
acura,mdx,2005,berto, 01/12/2006,Not your typical Honda product at all,pos,"Exterior is much sportier than the older body style with the new head/tail lights and dual outlet exhaust but still looks somewhat minivan-ish.  Interior build quality is outstanding, not extravagant and everything is logically placed.  Very minimal body roll and understeer for what it is.  Stereo sounds great especially for a base model.  Sound deadening is better than any Honda/Acura I've ever owned.  Seats are comfortable--I had to drive 12 hours stopping only for gas and felt fine.  Motor is exceptionally torquey for a Honda, but you pay for it at the pump.  Acts like an Audi sometimes though--pulsing from rear when turning from a stop, and transmission shifting is somewhat sluggish."
acura,mdx,2005,professor, 01/28/2006,"Expected a great car, but....",pos,"I purchased this vehicle one year ago and have had some problems with the exhaust system and acceleration.  My MDX makes an annoying noise at the 2 rpm mark, and does not have very good acceleration at times; I have had it checked (with little success) at my Acura dealer.  There are also some interior noises in the back doors, which is bothersome to listen to at times.  I really expected a lot more from this vehicle, especially for the price that I paid.  The gas mileage is not that great as well....getting around 14-15 mpg in the city and 17-18 mpg on the highway, and I drive fairly conservative."
acura,mdx,2005,Hecklabs, 03/22/2006,Love my MDX!,pos,"I am so pleased with this vehicle.  I looked at BMW and Lexus and found that the storage capacity (we have 3 Labs) was much bigger in the MDX.  It is extremely comfortable, roomy and well built.  Add to that the fact that it is the most reasonably priced and you've got a winner!!"
acura,mdx,2005,Bill, 03/22/2006,Great SUV,pos,I have had Acura sedns for years.  I got the MDX for the higher seat due to a bad back.  I find that the SUV gives me many more options for transporting things as well as providing a very confortable reliable ride.  My only wish would be for better gas milage.
acura,mdx,2005,SueOOO, 03/22/2006,Love It!,pos,I love my MDX and I'm looking forward to upgrade to the 2007!!  This SUV has everything!  And living in New England in the winter...the MDX was made for snow!  It also looks great in the summer and having a versatile car as a young woman is key!
acura,mdx,2005,sklug, 06/10/2006,Great Vehicle,pos,Great car after 18 months no complaints at all and no issues at all. Fuel Economy is much better than expected. 23.4 mpg on our last trip to OHIO running 75 mph. Gets 18.6 around town.  Goes great in the snow on trips to the northwoods.  entertainment system and is great. Nav is a little out of date.  My wife will never drive a different suv.
acura,mdx,2005,mdx, 07/21/2006,Power and comfort,pos,Best vehicle I have ever owned.  Would definately get another in the future.
acura,mdx,2005,krc, 08/02/2006,Great SUV - Excellent value,pos,"After 18 months, I can't find anything not to like about my MDX.  This is my first Acura and second SUV.  I am a finicky consumer and researched all luxury models prior to buying - it paid off!  For the money, this is by far the best SUV in its class.  Gas mileage was better than anticipated.  And, it has the highest safety/crash test ratings.  Quality, comfort, and value...I love it!"
acura,mdx,2005,Carole Matter, 12/20/2006,Most Outstanding Vehicle!!,pos,"I have owned a lot of nice vehicles, but the Acura MDX is my favorite vehicle I've ever had!  It does everything well.  I have the navigation system on mine, which I personally would never want to be without again.  Acura has the best one out there, in my opinion.  I test drove a lot of cars and SUVs before I bought this one, and nothing compared. I have had 7 people in my car for a sightseeing trip, and it was wonderful.  I also have had the challenge and fun of driving my MDX through blizzard conditions and on snow-packed, icy steep hills in Pittsburgh, PA, and I went down a very very steep hill in AWD and never even slid.  The vehicle in front of me had gone down the hill sideways!"
acura,mdx,2006,blondie, 02/25/2010,Transmission issue,pos,"I bought my vehicle in the end of 2007. I have loved my vehicle to date. Recently I started experiencing a shaking, shuddering when I let off the gas and then go to accelerate again. It appears to happen at about 40 mph. I have found out that it means I am going to have to have the torque and transmission replaced. Apparently this is common on the 2006 and earlier MDX. I am not at all happy and am now looking for a new vehicle, since this is a $7000 repair and I have no warranty. Apparently there is a recall on vehicles 2005 and earlier for the converter torque. Very disappointed since I bought this vehicle to keep long term."
acura,mdx,2006,blondie21dj, 03/22/2010,Noise between 35 and 40 mph,pos,"I am having a shuddering noise between 35 and 40 mph. It is usually when I lift my foot off the gas pedal and then go to accelerate. I took it to the dealership and they couldn't figure out what was wrong and I couldn't get the noise to duplicate. After reading several reviews on here, I figured out that it was the torque converter. I called Acura Client Services and reported the issue. They said they have not had a single person report this issue. Everyone needs to call and report this issue, so they can place a recall on this issue. They have recalls on 2005 and earlier but not 2006 as of yet. It appears to occur between 70k and 90k miles."
acura,mdx,2006,IgnatiusReilly, 05/17/2010,Very nice but not without headaches,neu,"I bought my CPO MDX about a year ago.  I drive mostly city/highway mix with a few long road trips here and there.  The gas mileage in city driving is weak averaging around 14mpg, nowhere near the 17 mpg it claims.  Pure highway driving has produced better results though getting 23.5 and 25 on two long highway trips.  The interior is what sold me on the car.  I'm 6'4 and this is one of the few cars that afforded me adequate seating room while still enabling an adult to sit behind me.  It comfortably fits 5 full size adults.  The all weather performance has exceeded my expectations.  I was able to drive through 1.5 feet of snow without issue."
acura,mdx,2006,mr.watson, 07/20/2016,Great SUV.,pos,"if you are thinking about purchasing the SUV just do it.  I just bought mine and its 10 years old. This vehicle runs like a 2016. Smooth ride, quiet cabin and plenty of leg room.
"
acura,mdx,2006,Acurafan, 10/16/2006,another great Acura vehicle,pos,"I really enjoy this Acura, the seating for 7 is great - can take my kids and their friends out in one vehicle. And can still park in my garage.  I've owned 4 previous Acuras, so I'm loyal,  but before buying this MDX I considered the  competitors. The MDX was the better total package - great balance of sporty features with practicality, Also, it's the perfect size allowing for a useful 3rd row (kids)."
acura,mdx,2006,Julia Romm, 01/24/2018,Great suv,pos,Bought the car at start of 2007. Still is a great car over the past 11 years. Recommend this SUV for a luxury 7 passenger.
acura,mdx,2006,Leet, 08/30/2009,Don't believe the MPG estimates!,neu,"If it were not for the mileage, this would be my favorite SUV (owned Suburban, Tahoe and Jimmy).  The vehicle can't meet the minimum mpg rating.  We drive this vehicle 50/50 hwy/city and are not getting crazy with the accelerator.  It's sad that I sold my perfectly running 03 Suburban for something I was told would get 17- 23 mpg and it only gets 1 mpg better than my 03 Suburban.  VERY disappointing...don't believe the salesman!"
acura,mdx,2006,Florida driver, 02/09/2010,Love it,pos,"Love it.  Bought used in 09 with 40k miles...lease turn in.  Was supposed to be certified but found the Onstar button didn't work.   Brought to dealership and they fixed...no problem.  Great ride, gets 19mpg on hwy and DVD system with bose speakers is great.  Nav can get washed out with sunlight or open sunroof though.  Expensive to upgrade to newer version.  No other problems to speak of. Loaded the back with work gear and seemed to set the back down a bit.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Acura MDX, 04/23/2008,Poor Fuel economy,neu,"This car is barely breaking 13 MPG that's combined city/hwy. Called Customer Service to see if they can do anything about it because  the dealer couldn't. The worst customer service ever, they said ""There is no issue for us to address"". WOW! That's after they put me on hold for 40 minutes."
acura,mdx,2006,MLW, 07/10/2019,Dream Vehicle,pos,"We bought my 2006 MDX Touring new, anticipating to keep it for along time.  I still own it, and it has 125,000 miles.  It has never broken down on me.  The standard maintenance is all its needed all these years.  I am investing in a new timing belt and muffler system since I expect to keep it for a few more years.  No complaints!
"
acura,mdx,2006,Bill's ToyTruck, 05/01/2010,Great work horse,pos,"Bought certified last year-had only 26k on it, due to some ""shop time"" having door and fender repainted and repaired. Use it as a music gear and trailer hauler, as well as my sole transportation. Great fuel economy (I average 19-20 mpg), even when hauling our 3,000 lb. Hi-Lo trailer. Also very solid build-no rattles. I put the transmission and power steering coolers on when I did the hitch, as Acura advises this. Also added a brake controller for the trailer. Put 9,000 miles on it and it's been great. Looked at new recently, but nothing hit me except the 2010 MDX at 45k. Can't justify banging up a new car that costs that much. "
acura,mdx,2006,maryindublin, 09/01/2007,Love my MDX!,pos,"I live in the mountains, lots of driving uphill and lots of snow in winter. Never had any problems in the snow with the AWD. I feel safe and confident. The front seats are very comfy, but the back seats could use a bit more room. I have a 3 year old in a booster seat in the back and he doesn't have all that much leg room. Still, I wouldn't trade it for anything and plan to drive it till it won't drive any more!"
acura,mdx,2006,Sailorgirl, 01/13/2019,Great family SUV,pos,"Great for a mom to carry children in town or on the toad.  Comfort, features were all great for my 12 years of ownership.
"
acura,mdx,2006,Rr, 08/05/2010,"Too noisy, never an Acura again",neu,"Typical Honda noise.  Cannot have conversation at highway speeds.  Engine whistling noise during highway speeds while accelerating.  Brake drum rolling noise while backing up and during braking at low speeds.  Terrible Bluetooth integration.  Only good for incoming calls.  Backup camera never good when needed most, too dim and is not useful when backing out from garage."
acura,mdx,2006,Kelayilg, 08/22/2006,Best value for the money paid,pos,"I replaced 2000 3.5RL with a 2006 MDX.  I purchased it from John Eagle Acura Houston TX.  For a Black on Black Touring model I paid $33,400 (including destination) +title and $50Doc. fee.  I am pretty happy with the price and the performance of this beautiful SUV.  Kids love the roomy interior with 7 seats.  I think this SUV is one of the best value for your money.  Smooth car like ride and the sleet look make it one of the best SUVs out there.  So far I am very happy with its performance."
acura,mdx,2006,AC and AS-C, 11/11/2006,recommend it!,pos,"Excellent, we are very happy with our MDX.  We are impressed with the quality of the car.  Well built."
acura,mdx,2006,toomanypetz, 03/27/2009,so nice,pos,"We replaced our Honda Pilot with this car.  I really liked my Pilot but to get all these features it would cost so much more.  The Acura has a smooth quiet ride and plenty of room.  I feel very luxurious with all the leather and comfort.  It makes me feel less like a ""soccer mom"".  We love it!"
acura,mdx,2006,Chief D, 12/08/2005,Sierra Hotel - Great Vehicle,pos,"This is my first SUV.  Having looked for almost a year, I kept coming back to the MDX.  It's a great driving experience.  The MDX is as smooth a ride as is our Avalon XLS (which my wife inherits).  Lots of room with lots of luxury."
acura,mdx,2006,SLS, 02/22/2006,3rd Acura - 2nd MDX,pos,This is my third Acura.  Have always found these cars a great value for the money.  Had my first 2002 MDX for 4 years and was looking for a new SUV but no matter how much research and test drives I did I kept coming back to the MDX because the price to feature and luxury ration could not be beat.
acura,mdx,2006,espoe, 03/03/2006,"Great Vehicle, needs updating",pos,"This is my first SUV and I went into one kicking and screaming.  But the need for a 3rd row of seats put me out of my long cherished German cars.  I compared this Nissan's entire line, Ford Freestyle, Pacifica, Higlander Hybrid, you name it.   I had narrowed it down to the MDX and the Highlander Hybrid.  Highlander was nice but felt less substantial and a lot more plasticky.   When I drove the MDX it was clearly different than the rest.  The quality just made itself evident in the way the dealer handled the transaction, the silky smooth drive train, quiet, comfortable, full time 4wd, warranty and the rest of the ride made it a simple choice.  Fuel economy is Ok.  Needs Premium, ouch!!"
acura,mdx,2006,pearl, 06/23/2008,Still Love My Acura!!,pos,"I still love my Acura after 2 years of ownership!  This is my 2nd car made by Honda and my other was an Accord and I have been very happy with both.  The Acura is like a Honda on steroids!  Love the back up TV, navigation, onstar, Bluetooth, heated seats, and my kids love the DVD.  I would definitely consider another Acura in the future!"
acura,mdx,2006,The Foxer, 07/14/2006,Buy another brand,neg,"We have owned a 2001, and 2003 MDX.  Both have the same problem.   The steering wheel vibrates at any speed above 65.  Tires replaced, wheel bearings replaced, rotors replaced and turned several times, tires ground force balanced and nothing fixes the problem. AC quit and multiple other problems. "
acura,mdx,2006,Jerry C, 05/21/2018,A very reliable and end enjoyable car to drive,neg,"I have owned this car for 12 years and have not had one day where I did not enjoy driving it. I have driven this car for 130,000 miles and the engine still hums. We have made several trips to Florida from the northeast and each time I have felt like I was sitting in an easy chair cruising down the highway. Maintenance has not been an issue. Changing  the fluids on a regular basis has kept the car in great operating condition If someone is looking for a great preowned  SUV I would recommend this vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2006,John Read, 05/28/2017,Great little suv,pos,"More road noise than you would expect.  Still a great little suv.  Still more road noise than I like.
"
acura,mdx,2006,mumbless89, 12/01/2010,never again!!!,neg,"comfortable car and roomy but the problems that  you get with this $40k car are unreal. Torque converters, transmissions, water leaks, cheap broken plastics, leather seats ripped after 4 years......gaskets around the doors are torn already!! unreal. Never again will i buy another acura product."
acura,mdx,2006,Diznefreek2, 10/15/2005,Love this car!!,pos,I use my MDX to bring my family (3 kids included) to the snow in the winter months and I have a hard time limiting it to that!!
acura,mdx,2006,Alan A, 05/28/2010,"Nice, reliable, but boring ride",neu,"Bought car new. Got good deal because new model year was arriving and dealer wanted to unload. Car has been very reliable.  Mileage running around 19 on average - and I do a lot of highway. Acceleration not bad at low end. Handling too mushy... feel like is going to roll over when aggressive on a corner. Interior space is adequate, rear seating relatively roomy, but third row seat is a torture chamber for anyone over ten years old. Overall, car has been lackluster and boring. I had a Nissan Murano before this vehicle and that was a much more exciting car to drive. This time I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 and, other than the gas mileage, this is one hairy ride!"
acura,mdx,2006,enlightenedacuraguy, 07/20/2007,Not True Luxury,neu,"This vehicle is overrated, not true luxury. No backlighting on the steering wheel buttons so you can't see what you're pushing in the dark, not even an option. A/C controls are in an uncomfortable place, and rear controls have to be reset every time you restart engine. Battery died 4 months after brand new. No back heater in passenger seat, not even an option. Power seats are far inferior to the seats in my '03 Tahoe. There is no 12v outlet for second row passengers, except the one in the bottom of the center console, very inconvenient. No power folding mirrors. It is very uncomfortable to drive long distances for a male, 5'10"", arms fall asleep after about 1 hour, and not enough leg room. "
acura,mdx,2006,Alex, 10/24/2005,Very reliable car,pos,"I have my MDX for one week. I already owned an MDX before that was excellent. Drives great, silent engine and good navigation system. the Rear entertainment system is a life saver with small kids. Since I bought the new MDX I hear the wind noise in the car when driving at 70 mph. Unusual, specially that I owned one before. The navigation system is improved however seems less accurate than in the 2004 model. Fuel consumption is moderate at 14 mpg. "
acura,mdx,2006,L Tunner, 10/15/2006,Great Vehicle for Shopping & Road Trips,pos,"This is the second MDX I've owned, and I love MDXs.  Perfect for our active lifestyle..my aunts and cousins call it our touring/shopping/eating machine. Navigation system is great for road trips and seeking out new sites.  Comfortably accomodates 5 shopping queens. Large cargo area has carried everything from 5 large dogs..club chairs..bags of mulch..lots of shopping bags. Performance, reliability and safety features are excellent.  "
acura,mdx,2006,richard nelson, 12/16/2005,MDX,pos,this is our 14th acura and they just keep getting better
acura,mdx,2006,Frank, 12/24/2005,Great vehicle,pos,I hads a 2003 MDX. This model is very similar and still has the same reliability. I love the voice activity NAV system. Also the blue tooth capability. 
acura,mdx,2006,Jacklemind, 07/13/2009,Awesome Drive - Love it,pos,"I recently brought a certified MDX.  I love the drive, it's powerful, fun to drive.  Gas mileage is not bad, considering it's a luxury offering.  The dashboard was not hard to figure out, however, the sound system is not that great, although it has BOSE speakers, it does not deliver the punch.  No Aux input (newer cars have it) - bummer.  Spacious interior, although 3rd row seating is not for adults - it's more a 6 seater than 7.  All other features are great, independent rare AC - love it.  Cargo space is not good with 3rd row seats up.  Would recommend buying a cargo net, otherwise, things will be all over the cargo area."
acura,mdx,2006,Cathy and Frank, 06/23/2006,MDX Review,pos,The Navagation System has come very handy during some of trips to unknown places. The system always knows where we are and provides excellent directions.
acura,mdx,2006,Marc, 10/18/2006,Best choice for third row seat 4wd SUV,pos,"I have 3, soon to be 4 kids. But this is the secondary kid hauler to the minivan. The MDX is incredibly comfortable with just the right amount of refinement to be attractive but not overdone.  All my kids are comfortable in the third row (tall 6 and 8 year olds) with moderate room behind 3rd row. Gas mileage has been 17 city and as good as 27 on the highway. Fold down seating is quick and easy. Stereo is good, not great. Runs fine on 87 or 93 octane."
acura,mdx,2006,johnny wishbone, 10/08/2006,"First Acura, Awesome SUV",pos,This is my first Acura and I'm thrilled with it to say the least. The MDX handles like a sports car and has the comfort of a luxury vehicle. The interior is well thought out and the XM radio is a big hit with the family. The navigation is excellent and easy to use. The voice recognition is excellent once you learn the proper commands. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a midsize SUV.
acura,mdx,2006,klin, 11/18/2006,This car certainly has room to improve,pos,"The ease of driving and handling was what attracted to purchase this vehicle.  On May of this year, I bought a new Toyota 4runner 2006 before I purchased the MDX. In my opinion, 4runner is a better built vehicle overall.  The interior of the MDX is slightly cheaper, and I found the cover of the door knob actually moves a little bit instead of fix to the door, a small but annoying defect, and the interior looks cheaper comparing with Toyota.  The back door of MDX can not close completely without slamming it.  What a pain... If you just try to be a little bit gentle on the car, then the door won't close properly.  In comparison, The 4runner has automatic door closer, and quality is awesome. "
acura,mdx,2006,SoccaMomma23542, 11/02/2005,Nice Car,pos,I received this car last month because my husband received a promotion and wanted to give me something new. Mine is the fully loaded Touring model. Decent car.
acura,mdx,2006,jennifer, 06/09/2008,LOVE my MDX,pos,"I love my car.  I am consistently getting between 18-20 MPG, which is great for a 7 passenger vehicle.  Quality of finish is great.  Has everything I would ever want in a car.  Navigation easy to maneuver.  Heated seats work well.  XM and Bluetooth both work well also.  My 6' teenage son is a little cramped in the back seat--mostly because he slouches.  Wish there was sunglasses holder, but center console works fine.  Automatic closing hatch would have been a nice feature, but all in all, this is the best car I've owned.  I have been looking around for something with same features and 25 mpg in the city... can't find anything that compares!!!"
acura,mdx,2006,LZ, 06/17/2008,Zacura,pos,"In 18 months of driving the MDX, not a single item has needed repair - we had a leaking tire once, but the dealer removed the nail, patched the tire, and didn't even charge me (and we only knew of the condition because of the dashboard warning light). Great ride, sporty handling, good acceleration off the line, does everything right."
acura,mdx,2006,TR, 12/29/2008,"So far, so good!",pos,"I just bought my MDX after owning an Yukon & Odyssey. I loved, loved, loved my Yukon, but the MDX is neck and neck. I certainly have more options with the MDX and paid a lot less. It's the perfect size for me to haul my 3 pre-teens and their friends around in. I don't give anything  a 10 rating, so consider my 9 your 10. Would highly recommend it. The back lift gate is light enough to close. No need for a power lift gate. "
acura,mdx,2006,blackjack, 11/05/2005,Great Family Vehicle,pos,"An avid Honda fan, I decided I was at the age where I deserved a little more luxury. However, with two kids and two dogs, a sports sedan wasn't going to cut it.  Our MDX is so smooth and fun to drive, yet it offers all the things we need as a family. It is very spacious and feels sturdy and responsive on the road.  It brakes well and handles rough roads easily.  The gas mileage is suprisingly good for such a large and powerful vehicle. We use regular gas most of the time, and the gas mileage does not appear to be affected significantly.  We enjoy our MDX very much and feel safe in it.   I highly recommend purchasing the optional side molding as we did - I do not have one ding to speak of. "
acura,mdx,2006,Snow, 12/25/2005,First SUV,pos,"This is the third Acura I have owned.  It is great vehicle. Fun to drive, handles well in ice and snow.  Great sound system.  Over all I am very happy with the MDX.  This is my first SUV, and I wouldn't go back to a car after driving this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2006,mdxfinally, 01/10/2006,Love it!,pos,"Have owned an Acura Integra for 14yrs. but with two kids, needed a bigger car. This was perfect! Love the drive, visibility, and safety features. Could do without the cheap plastic wood accents on the interior, but otherwise love everything about it!"
acura,mdx,2006,Tom, 02/04/2006,TomO's MDX,pos,We have had this car since June 05. The fit and finish is perfect Other than the less than perfect gas mileage I wouldnt change a thing.  We only have 2200 miles on the car.
acura,mdx,2006,Gregory Volkov, 02/06/2006,Fun to drive,pos,It is my second MDX. I love this car so does my family. For the price it is the roomiest and best SUV on the market. Fun to drive and easy to maintain.
acura,mdx,2006,Tina, 03/11/2006,Ok so far,pos,"I needed the space so I traded my 04 TL- I am dissapointed in the lack of power, compared to the TL, however the layout is nice- I hate where the parking break is- its in the way of stretching out my left leg.Wish the stereo was better and illuminated, and placed higher on the steering column. Clock should be where heat display is. Wish the nav. creen was programable as  to what is displayed.I like the look of it but would like to see the front end redesigned. Gas mileage is acceptable for such a roomy SUV. I wanted white with a black interior but, your stuck with the light colored interior WHY?? doesnt acura change the limited color choices? I hate the light interior- it gets too dirty"
acura,mdx,2006,2XMDX, 03/26/2006,2006 MDX,pos,"In upgrading from a 2003 MDX, it came down to getting an MDX 06' versus a competitor which I found not as powerful or fun to drive as the MDX. This was an upgrade since we did not have the Navigation feature which I highly recommend.  The MDX is a joy to drive (suspension).  I am very happy with the slight modifications that they have made to the interior layout (although the competitor's interior is much more plush).  Obviously, being a repeat customer speaks for itself in the level of satisfaction."
acura,mdx,2006,The Ack, 05/06/2006,The Ack,pos,"After owning a 1994 Acura Legend Coupe, this new addition to the family was no surprise of it's greatness.  I have been exstremely pleased and the expectations continued to be met each time I start the MDX up. "
acura,mdx,2006,m2, 05/23/2006,2nd MDX,pos," This car fit our needs and the opportunity came up to trade in a 2003 MDX (touring with RES) for the 2006 MDX (Touring with Nav&RES).  I took the opportunity to upgrade to Navigation & RES and am so happy I did.  The car is fun to drive and meets our families need.  Obviously I am happy with the MDX or I would not have been a return customer.  The Navigation makes trips really stress free and although I don't have a bluetooth phone at the moment, I can't wait until I start using this feature."
acura,mdx,2006,Jenina, 06/30/2006,I Love My MDX,pos,"I checkd out my MDX for 3 months before I purchased.  I definitely did my homework before I bought this vehicle, the only opponent to the MDX was the Lexus and the deciding factor was when I realized that every option added to the Lexus would cost atleast another grand!  With the MDX all the goodies were included."
acura,mdx,2006,Brad, 07/04/2006,MDX Rocks,pos,"We love our new MDX. Fun to drive, extremly comfortable, and as reliable as any SUV on the market.  Engine is very impressive."
acura,mdx,2006,Jim Haynie, 07/10/2006,"Great Vehicle, but could use improvement",pos,"The vehicle is great riding higher than the Acura RL.  Acura uses standards across all cars on items like placement of controls and heights of arm rests.  However, this vehicle is clearly not the flagship car.  The RL has much better features, but you can't put in a new TV in your RL.  I love the vehicle but miss some of the features of the RL. MPG is closer to 14 city and 24 highway. Nice interior, but not as fit and trim as the RL.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Tracy, 07/13/2006,The best SUV ever,pos,"Granted I have only had my MDX for less than a month but I LOVE THIS SUV.  It is the most comfortable, the most convenient interior vehicle I have ever owned. I have had 3 Lexus before this but now I am an Acura customer forever."
acura,mdx,2006,Sam, 07/13/2006,So Far So good.....,pos,Just purchased this vehicle for my Wife and now I am so jealous of her since she gets to drive it everyday.  Overall car can't be beat as it has so much bang for the buck.  Nav system is great and a lot of fun to interact with. Car drives incredibly smoothly and power is available as soon as you need it.  I am having a hard time keeping the speed low during break-in. Owned 1 Acura before and loved the service and care of brand.  Matches to any German brand in my books. Buy this car and you'll see what I mean.
acura,mdx,2006,Jim, 07/24/2006,Great SUV,pos,"This is my second MDX, and I think it is the best car out there."
acura,mdx,2006,awesome car/price, 07/25/2006,Dream come true in 4 wheels,pos,"I purchased this vehicle at ryan's open road acura in New Bruinswick, NJ. the sales person Mark Gershmann was tremendously helpful and did the best he could to make the shopping experience a one of a kind. i bought the silver with black interior with navigation for $36,602 which included the $615 destination fee.(they threw in the splash guards for free) it was an awesome deal i couldnt refuse. the car dealer's instaquote system is great! The best price paid for the car."
acura,mdx,2006,LovemyMDX, 08/09/2006,I Love This Truck!,pos,"I saw this truck on the highway when it first came out and had to know what it was. I loved the look. Then I did research and found it was one of the safest SUV's with it's wide wheel base. When my husband and I went to test drive it I didn't. I just knew I loved it. So when I picked it up after ordering the color I wanted I enjoyed it more than ever. I just love driving this Truck. My 3 vehicles before were a 77' Camaro, 84 Trans Am, and a 93' Camry. It has great room for the kids and vacations. Plus it's very easy to clean."
acura,mdx,2006,Bill, 08/18/2006,Very Pleased With This,pos,"I really wanted a TSX, but with the kids and boat, etc. that became impossible.  I test drove this vehicle and could not believe it was an SUV.  It handles (no kidding here) almost as good as my Audi A6 (don't laugh . . . really!)  Very comfortable.  Don't bother with the DVD package .. . you can buy each kid their own for a lot less.  NAV however is well worth it.  Surprisingly good voice recognition.  Plenty of power (surprised here also.  Bose system okay . . . Definitely get the Acuralink for Ipod . . . works GREAT.   Some things don't make sense however, no lighted controls on steering, placement of clock . . . but next version expected to be better.  A solid purchase.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Love the MDX, 10/16/2005,My MDX,pos,"The MDX is a very nicely built car. It is comfortable and rides like a dream. It is quiet and accellerates nicely without any laboring.  Its gas mileage is good for the size vehicle. It does however lack some amenities that I think should be standard on all models since this is a luxury car, ie. power liftgate, memory seats and mirrors, telescoping steering wheel, power passenger seats."
acura,mdx,2006,Chicagomom, 12/19/2005,Happy with new MDX,pos,"We bought the new MDX to replace both an Odyssey and a Mercedes E320 because we're moving to the city and we like to go to the mountains. The MDX is easy to drive, has plenty of power, intuitive controls and dash, and great navigation system. For its weight, not bad mileage."
acura,mdx,2006,Paul, 01/13/2006,Awsome,pos,I've driven over 10 vehicles for last 12 years and this MDX was the only one I purchased same one twice since 2001. Both were black exterior in 2001 & 2006. Strongly recommended for either wives or husbands.
acura,mdx,2006,Richard Roman, 01/15/2006,Repeat Acura buying,pos,"I find the MDX is fun and very comfortable driving, very responsive in accelerating when needed. I have had five of us riding in and the four said if they had the money, will go for MDX. This Acura is my third, 1987 Legend, 1998 4door Integra, and now 2006 MDX (no GPS touring)."
acura,mdx,2006,AED2491, 02/19/2006,"Love the MDX, hate the mileage",pos,"I love the MDX. I drove a company car for years, and switched jobs so I had to purchase a car for the first time in over 10 years.  I purchased it due mostly to the fact that it was the best- fitting SUV for me. (I am 6'4"" tall, so the leg room was what led me to the MDX).  Looked at other mid-size SUV's (Toyota, Volvo, VW, etc.) and others were just too small for me.  All the features in the car are outstanding!   "
acura,mdx,2006,carolinaeagle, 03/02/2006,Typical Acura Quality,pos,3rd Acura owned - and there is just something about the fit/finish to an Acura that stands out.  Love the performance and handling of the MDX - drives better than a lot of sedans.  Interior design/layout is perfect.  Love the quality that you see everywhere. Sage brush pearl is an awesome color.
acura,mdx,2006,happyMDXowner, 03/02/2006,What a truck!!!,pos,"I was in love with MDX since it come out in 99 and finally have one on my driveway. It proved everything I have expected and more. Very nice size, plenty of guts and excelent quality. Dealer was great too. Wife loves it too and it equally comfortable for both of us. Looked at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus and MDX tops them all in my eyes. Great value, highly recomended for both men and women alike"
acura,mdx,2006,paratrooper1, 03/08/2006,Love this Vehicle!!!,pos,"My wife and I must have looked at every suv out there when we were in the market to purchase one. We have always liked the MDX but we just figured that we would find something that we would like better. Well, we didn't. We were going to get the Volvo XC-90 but it just didn't drive as nice as the MDX and the seats were not as comfortable and also it had very bad reliability ratings in Consumer Guide (as well as most of the European SUV's did). But as I said before it was just the perfect fit for us and what we wanted in a suv. "
acura,mdx,2006,Duane, 03/08/2006,I LOVE MY MDX!,pos,"I have driven the MDX when it first came out; however wasn't in a position to buy due to my enthusiasm with the TL.  Coming from a Honda Odyssey, I found it necessary for me to continue to have the space for me and my children while expanding my versatility with it's all-wheel drive capability.  Now my third Acura owned, the Acura MDX provides for me the luxury and performance I desire; the necessity of satisfying the soccer and vacation trips, and the comfort of owning a truly reliable vehicle."
acura,mdx,2006,Tina, 03/17/2006,GOOD SO FAR!,pos,"I ONLY HAVE 50O MILES ON MY suv. but so far,  I love the cozy interior, and the way most things are layed out. It drives quiet on the freeway and acceleration is adequate. great bluetooth, navigation, and black leather feels like quality leather.I  Wish navigation was able  to display what I am interested in seeing. but systems gives great verbal directions when looking for destination. Heated seats are ok, not as hot as the TL. Please re-design the front end of this rig. Please give us the choice of dark interior for any color choice we choose.Cargo space is super large, and wide, nice back seat room, seats move easily compared to other 3rd row seat SUVS. "
acura,mdx,2006,Laura Petit, 03/16/2006,Acura MDX,pos,"I owned a 2002 MDX, and traded it for a Toyota 4-Runner.  Within 6 months I was trading the Toyota for another Acura MDX.  I love this car, the ride, comfort and the look."
acura,mdx,2006,Jaybird, 03/31/2006,Best bang for your buck,pos,Best luxury/options package for your money on the market. Great ride and handling. Intuitive control panel. Fun to drive. 
acura,mdx,2006,DCruz, 04/02/2006,Great Vehicle!,pos,I love this vehicle that I even recommended my sister to buy one and she did.  The only thing is that I should have gotten the DVD Entertainment System.  
acura,mdx,2006,holly, 04/18/2006,My First SUV,pos,"I test drove all the SUV crossovers out there before deciding on the MDX. I love the width of the car.  Much wider than a Chev. Tahoe and the like. It is a smooth ride and handles very well. I love navigation which is something that I wasn't even interested in in the beginning, but after I test drove one with navigation, my mind changed.  Now I'm spoiled and will always have to have Navigation.  After driving a Chrysler 300M for several years, I am surprised at many features that my Chrysler had that the Acura doesn't.  Being a luxury car you would think it would have everything.  See below under ""suggested improvements"".  Other cars like the Lexus 330 had much softer/plusher seats too."
acura,mdx,2006,Susan, 05/17/2006,New Purchase,pos,"Just purchased my MDX, but am happy thus far.  In Austin, I bought it for invoice plus $220 for molding, wood steering wheel, tint, moonroof visor and roof rack.  Deals are occuring. Shop around."
acura,mdx,2006,Don, 06/09/2006,Best SUV on the market,pos,"Great combination of power, handling, and comfort.  Kids love the DVD system!  "
acura,mdx,2006,xprepairpro.com, 07/15/2006,Great SUV for sedan lovers,pos,"I wasn't wanting an SUV, I was really wanting a TL or an RL but room (2 kids now) means the 03 accord wouldn't cut it and the TL/RLs dont have much more room.  I have never owned an SUV but have driven a lot at an old job.  I didn't like the truck feeling of most SUVs so I didn't think the MDX would be so ""car-like"".  I was quite surprised when I test drove it at the dealer.  It had a lot of power and steering was very much like a normal car.  I wasn't as attracted to the MDX so much for style.  I like it very much, but still have my doubts about the front end.  Hearing such good reviews and safety and reliability reports, I drove the MDX off the lot the day I test drove it.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Tracer, 08/02/2006,Unbreakable!,pos,"It's a great drive, for a 'large' (it really is large, once you see it next to a CRV or something) SUV. Fuel-wise, we've been getting better milage on the highway than Acura states, in the city it likes to drink a bit.  Car's a little on the slow side (compared to our other vehicle, the 2005 Acura RL) but it's very heavy of course.  The car has never had problems, nothing ever breaks (unlike our previous Lexus, on which EVERYTHING broke within a year) and it just keeps going and going, especially considering my lead foot."
acura,mdx,2006,Tony, 09/02/2006,Best SUV ever,pos,I have had many cars over my life time. I have enjoyed many brands as well. This time I traded my TSX for my MDX. Everyday I enjoy the MDX more and more. Funny thing... my 24 yr son wants to buy one as well. So it spans the generation. You will not be disappointed!
acura,mdx,2006,econ1, 09/24/2006,Even better than the 2003,pos,"We had 78,000 miles of our 2003 MDX (which we loved - never any problems - still had the original tires, brakes, etc.) and didn't particularly like the looks of the 2007, so opted for a new one minus the DVD package, which we never used.  It's an unexpected significant improvement over the 2003 -- it's more quiet, LOVE the Handsfreelink, and the NAVI systems works even faster than the one in the 2003 model.  May have slightly more power, but the 2003 had plenty.  Added a trailer hitch to this to tow PWCs.  Have thoroughly enjoyed the XM radio as well.  We've already put 5,000 miles on this one in 2 months."
acura,mdx,2006,Josh, 10/02/2006,Best Mid Size SUV,pos,"I love this SUV. Best in Class! I test drove several competitors.They all were good. But for the price, value and for things that I was looking for in a Luxury SUVs the MDX was outstanding!!"
acura,mdx,2006,Diana S. Rumsey, 10/08/2006,Great Car!,pos,"Being that The Acura is my very first new car purchase, I did a great deal of research and comparisons.  I am extremely pleased with my decision!  The Acura MDX smooth & quiet to drive & holds curves well.  The interior is comfortable & very adaptable.  Both my husband and myself are physically handicapped and find the car to be a perfect fit for our needs."
acura,mdx,2006,R. Harris, 10/24/2006,Acura MDX: Delivers with Value,pos,"Just bought a EOY 2006 and what a value. Loaded it came in under $38K and then added a GAMIN GPS 52 for $500.00 saving $7,000.00. "
acura,mdx,2006,Outstanding!! by FOB, 12/09/2006,Outstanding!! by FOB,pos,"When I decided to buy a mid-size SUV I settled on test driving the RX 350, X5 and MDX.  I have owned the MDX for two months now and couldn't be happier with my choice --- performance, interior quality, and comfort are oustanding... all this for $7K less than the closest competitor."
acura,mdx,2006,Danno, 12/13/2006,AZ Acura MDX Owner's Comments,pos,"Great handling pleasure to drive vehicle.  OK mileage.  Quiet, solid, spacious.  Always wanted one, now I have one.  Like the way the vehicle is appointed with leather seats, and wood trim.  Fold down seats help and 3rd row conceals nicley.  Safe, luxurious, sporty, good HP, performs well on and off road (within reason... not a rock crawler). Glad I bought it.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Leslie Mays, 01/13/2007,Les' MDX,pos,"Driving experience with my 2006 MDX is hands down ""all stares"".  I drive for a living, so at the time of searching for a new car I became very selective about the vehicle I wanted to purchase, I had a few in mind but, when I ran across the MDX on the highway I fell in love with the looks at first, then when I visited the dealer and saw what it had to offer, I was taken.  All my friends love my MDX and for me the joy of knowing where I go the MDX will be there by my side.  "
acura,mdx,2006,laxdad, 10/31/2007,Black Touring Navi and Entertainment,pos,"First off we do love this vehicle and except for a chronic rear door sticking issue, this SUV has been a great vehicle, drives more like a car than a truck, plenty of power and comfortable, family loves XM radio and navigation is huge help when traveling. We got the running boards, pinstripe and rear deflector which really helps dress the look up. Gas mileage is as usual disappointing but expected. We avg 15 around town and just over 20 on the road."
acura,mdx,2006,Realtor, 05/08/2008,Great Ride,pos,The fuel economy is really not bad when compared with other SUVs. I average 19 mpg (more city than hwy). The ride is smooth and quiet. I am a realtor and my clients always comment on how comfortable this vehicle is. I enjoy the ride myself and only regret that I did not upgrade to the touring. The base stereo is really lacking and no passenger power seat is embarrasing in a vehicle of this caliber.
acura,mdx,2006,SouthernPeanut3, 07/22/2020,I absolutely love this SUV!,pos,"This is a great car! They last a very long time (if you take care of it). It’s great for traveling (especially in the mountains) and it handles very well! It’s very spacious and the music sounds great (compared to an Audi and Yukon)! This car is very comfortable. The only downside is that it won’t connect to newer phones but other than that, I love this SUV! This SUV has been one of the best I’ve owned so far! I definitely recommend buying this SUV!
"
acura,mdx,2007,Tony, 01/14/2007,Best in Class!,pos,"Wife and I were in market for vehicle with 3rd row of seating.  We don't like the large truck-like SUVs and also do not like minivans.  We decided to look into the luxury SUV segment and narrowed our choices to the BMW X5, Volvo XC90, LandRover LR3, and the Acura MDX.  After test driving all and reviewing the numbers, the MDX was the obvious choice.  Unbelievable extras for the money.  When compared with these other luxury SUVs, I would have had to pay around $60K to get the same amount of features.  Acura navigation currently head and shoulders above competition.  Love the combination of luxury, utility, and convenience.      "
acura,mdx,2007,nregier, 02/09/2011,Snow machine!,pos,"We love our MDX Sport. Smooth, powerful, stylish, great looks, handles like a sports sedan. We've had lots of snow and ice lately and this Acura handles it like a champ.
The vehicle stability control, ABS, big tires, and 300hp V6 make for a formidable all weather machine. Driving it inspires confidence. We get 14mpg in city, best ever is 24 on highway. "
acura,mdx,2007,JGumby, 01/11/2007,Germany meets Japanese SUV,pos,"I have about 1,300 miles so far and do enjoy it.  Tested RX 330, XC90, Touraeg and this is it.  Acceleration a little touchy at start, maybe software upgrade to transmission needed.  Ride is excellent, super quiet, luxurious interior.  I purchased base model and has great features for price point. Mileage about 19 mpg with mostly suburb driving. Mine came with Bridgestone Dueler tires with B/B rating, I would expect best quality for this vehicle. You get Mich. A/A when you buy other trim lines. Shame on you Acura.  Telescopic steering wheel could go another inch, I'm 6'1"" just to be safe."
acura,mdx,2007,jt, 01/10/2007,Good Value SUV,pos,"Good vehicle, good overall value. Handles well, lots of nice technological items inside. High seating."
acura,mdx,2007,ggsdrummer, 12/05/2006,Best Performing SUV for the money!!,pos,"I test drove the BMW X3, X5, owned the Honda Pilot 2006. Once I saw this new MDX I had to test drive it. The SH-AWD really is impressive. It corners under acceleration like nothing I've driven before. I'ved owned a couple BMWs and we just bought for my wife a 2007 328ci with sport suspension. I'm amazed at how well the MDX holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding  under extreme cornering. Brakes are great. The third row is nice in a pinch for small trips."
acura,mdx,2007,RWM, 11/17/2006,"This SUV may be ""just right""",pos,"My land cruiser was too big, my FX45 was a lot of fun but too small for family trips, hopefully this is just right. Plan to spend a night in the garage learning the new toys. There is room for my wife's luggage, the kids and dad's luggage and the golf clubs. Not as fast as my FX45 but performace is as advertised and does not disapoint. Sport and Ent. package provide the technology and ride quality you want, toys for the kids, room and comfort for the wife and family. The styling is better and more masculine than last year. It looks like a SUV rather than a minivan. Looks better with side step running boards and roof rack."
acura,mdx,2007,Jeff, 01/04/2007,2007 Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"I find this vehicle to be exceptional in design, comfort, and responsiveness. My initial concern of possible road noise was unfounded. Rides very well. Only surprise was the original equipment tires were only DOT rated Traction/Temperature B/B. Disappointing for a luxury SUV. Had optional roof rack and cross bars installed since these are no longer standard equipment."
acura,mdx,2007,Vic J., 11/13/2006,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"Very nice vehicle overall, but not outstanding. Acceleration (off-the-line) is not very strong and feels only very slightly better than my previous '02 MDX. Once it gets going (around 3500 RPM) the engine comes to life. Don't see all the hype about SuperHandling-AWD - much better than the old model, but not any better than others such as the new BMW X5. Ride comfort great with the Active dampers! and front seats are excellent! - but fuel economy is a big disappointment - only getting around 12mpg city and 18 mpg highway at 75mph. (I have about 1650 miles on my MDX.) "
acura,mdx,2007,Jaya, 11/18/2006,"Wow!! Amazing, Best of All, AWESOME!!!",pos,"We test drive different SUVs in its class but  MDX has outdone themselves with excellent interior and exterior. While we enjoy driving this, people's heads start turning on the freeway.  It was a worth wait to get MDX sh-awd acura advance which has best performance and value. You don't have to think twice before buying MDX because it's got the whole nine yards. Go get it."
acura,mdx,2007,Al, 01/04/2007,A driver's SUV,pos,"About 3 weeks into my ownership, and I love the MDX so far.  It is probably the most comfortable drive of any vehicle I have owned, including luxury sedans.  I narrowed my choices to the MDX, Q7 and XC90 and the MDX won without too much thought.  And the value is outstanding for what you are getting."
acura,mdx,2007,Peter T, 09/28/2018,"11-Years-Old, High Miles, Still A Great Choice!",pos,"We purchased this with 140K miles, in immaculate, well-maintained condition despite being such an old, high-miles car.  It's a beautiful, well-made car inside and out, with great safety features.  We now have put +28K miles on it with no problems, including trips to the East and West Coasts (from KS).  The front seat comfort is amazing, and the second row seat comfort is great for all but people with very long legs.  The third-row is only for short trips or smaller than average people.  Short people in my family are comfortable there indefinitely but I'm 6' and I wouldn't want to be there for more than an hour.  The cargo capacity with the third-row down is excellent -- easily fits luggage and camping gear for four adults on a cross-country trip.   For an SUV, the power and handling of this are terrific and will put you off most other SUVs, even most new ones.  The acceleration is better than most sedans on the road and the braking is good.  It's almost a sports car!  But it's also a luxury car: very quiet and easy to control even cruising in high crosswinds at Western Interstate speeds.  The Navigation system is great but you have to buy a DVD from Acura if you want to update it from '07.  Although I highly recommend this car as a great used, high-miles SUV, there are cons.  It requires expensive premium gasoline, the gas mileage is lower than average in class, the leather on the seats is thin and fragile, the back-up camera picture is easily washed out by bright sunlight, the radio has poor FM reception with the stock antenna, and (like in many other Honda cars) leg movement is restricted in the front passenger seat by the dash-console design.  This came with a doughnut instead of a real spare tire.  There is room enough for a real spare unless you install a hitch mount like I did.  With a hitch mount you have to settle for a doughnut as your spare.
"
acura,mdx,2007,Kat, 11/02/2010,"Fantastic vehicle, but a few quirks...",pos,"We love our Acura.  However, after putting about 10,000 miles on it during a cross-country move, we have found a few disappointing features.  The leather seats are showing more ""wear & tear"" than I would expect for a vehicle this age.  The leather quality in my Subaru is far better!  The leather has pulled up from the center console and is loose.  The radio is a bit quirky, as it resets the radio stations randomly to the factory settings (and no, its not because of the Driver 1 & Driver 2 keys).  The paint seems to chip VERY easily.  A beautiful car altogether, though, and a smooth ride that easily pulled a large U-haul trailer through the Rocky Mountains!"
acura,mdx,2007,rslewis, 08/28/2014,07 Loaded MDX,pos,"We bought our 07 in 2014 with 100k for 14k out the door from a small dealer that only sells about 12 cars a year.. 

Had it checked out by a local Honda dealership and came back good except for the passenger rear sport shock was leaking and needed to be replaced... no big deal, until I found out that you can only get the sport shock from Acura at $700 a pop...
OK!!

My only gripe about the truck though, ours has sport, entertainment, tech and tow packages... the only thing it doesn't have is the back-up sensors that beep.
It's grey with tan interior and it looks awesome... you can tell its a solid truck when driving it, no rattles and very firm when in sport mode. Great SUV!
"
acura,mdx,2007,traeger, 09/01/2010,Good long term buy!,pos,"Looking at many CUVs, I went with my mdx. It is fantastic. Tight construction, sure footed ride and handling, spacious second row!, good entertainment package with fantastic features.  This is a very good all around car for all variations of travel, weather, and conditions.  "
acura,mdx,2007,BDAATL, 08/01/2019,Great in Every Possible Situation!,pos,"I bought a 2007 Acura MDX Feb of 2019 with 155k miles. Great vehicle! Everyone thinks it’s brand new unless I tell them & then they’re shocked. It has everything we could want or need. There’s room for family & friends. Lots of space for trips where no one is uncomfortable & everything fits. Took it on a 12 hr straight drive each way & it was the easiest drive I’ve ever had. The heated seats, reclining seats & personal temp for all in the first 2 rows is unreal & there’s still cup holders & storage for the 3rd row with more space than any other I’ve seen. All 3 rows lie down & there’s a DVD package that means we’d be okay if we needed to pull over to rest or chill out while camping. I’ve got the tow package & a lite weight camper which is great to hook up & get out of town for the weekend. During extremely heavy rains, rough terrain & ice you’re notified of which wheels are spinning & others grip right away. Feel very safe driving this, it has everything I wanted & so much more. I plan to keep this for a very long time. Before this my Mercedes ML420 was my favorite vehicle & I’m surprised to say I now have a new favorite that works so great for so many passengers at the same time. ❤️It!
"
acura,mdx,2007,JayT., 12/20/2006,My First Acura Vehicle,pos,"This is my first Acura vehicle, I previously owned a BMW coupe & am a current owner of an Odyssey. I primarily got this vehicle because of the value that was packed into this model. Comparing it with a BMW X5 (07- 3.0), this was a much lighter vehicle, lower cost & easier to handle. The ride was also quiet and the seats are comfortable. The third row seats' leg/shoulder room is better than the competition. Middle row seats are very comfy for the two outer most, however the middle one is not good for long travel. The driver seat is excellent in holding the driver and power seats have lumbar support. The sound system rocks! Navigation is easy to use & voice commands are very convenient."
acura,mdx,2007,SWANN, 11/25/2006,Acura RL on Steroid,pos,"Just picked up mine last week, black on black with Technology and Entertainment. So far I have put in five hundred miles. All heads turn. Drove during Thanksgiving trip, loving the bluetooth and live traffic info. State of the art GPS system."
acura,mdx,2007,Mr. Research, 12/17/2006,Car Man's Best Car,pos,"2007 MDX may be best car I've ever had. My previous cars were no slouches: BMW 540i (6-speed), M5, X5, and Infiniti FX-45. I loved all of them! This is very similar to X5 only leaves $20,000 in your pocket. This car has fantastic ride in comfort for most roads, and sports car handling on windy mountain byways. We love the voice controls for Nav, climate and stereo.  Stereo is best short of Audi A8 which runs $8,000. If you can find one, buy it loaded!  Taupe interior is gorgeous! Seats are sensational!  Power is adequate. Incredibly quiet too."
acura,mdx,2007,Barry, 12/25/2006,What a great car!!,pos,"After a couple of months, of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 Lexus GX 470, I finally wore her down and we (she) reluctantly bought the Acura. One of my concerns was moving ""down"" to an Acura from a Lexus. I was extremely wrong, this is one  high tech machine, the navigation system offers more features, but is much more user friendly than the Lexus, The entertainment package gives the kids the option of listening to their choice through the headphones while the adults can listen to something different through the speakers & handling on this car is unbelievable. You can even set the doors to lock/unlock at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or all doors w/ 1 touch.     "
acura,mdx,2007,DLU, 12/10/2018,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"I really love my MDX. For the 11 yrs I've owned it, I have not experience any major mechanical issues.
"
acura,mdx,2007,NamPaiVong, 12/30/2018,Best car I've owned will highly recommend to buy,pos,"Car is very good for the price,bought mine March of 2017 with 150k now has 180k!still drives like a CHAMP! Has very good power for a big mid size SUV for 300hp it's worth it! I love the look because it has luxury and a sporty look!I bought it used at a private lot and I still have a 3 year warranty surprisingly! Only thing that went wrong with it at first was that mdx known for the corroded battery wires that needed to be changed,it clicked with a ticking sound that the car didn't want to start BUT POWER STILL STAYED ON and eventually car tech moved wires and showed me that it was corroded WIRES, it wasn't a biggy cost 38 bucks for wires at auto zone changed myself, and cats went out at 170k but changed them and found them for 120 for both front and back and took very long to change the rear because the amount of less room there is and all the stuff you have to move out the way, BUT I love the handling I can do 100mph turn on a 35mph freeway turn easily without spinning out! And I don't even have a sport version. I highly recommend for someone to buy that wants a next step up family car instead of a van! This car does the trick, went camping with family of 7 and a extra storage cargo on top of car and went up steep hills an rocks, gravel wont recommend to do that all the time on the rocky climate, but gravel or dirt roads ok.snow was great as well! But here in northern cali don't snow too much but mudding an all is great too.Love my mdx to death and my integra! ...got a car for racing and car for cruising/mudding lol.Soon I will retune and chip my ECU on mdx and race my mdx lol PROS: great on handling,performance, Is great for a Lyft XL I always gotten great reviews of 5! Because of the look of luxury!and picked up a lot of hot chicks!lol, good to haul,great space to do oil changes under the car and don't have to jack up the car  CONS: needs better in an out space for 3rd row, better gas mileage, a little more luggage room,think it should be a little lifted for off roading and all terrain tires. OVERALL CAR IS AN AMAZING MACHINE.
"
acura,mdx,2007,George, 05/19/2010,WOW!,pos,"One word, Wow! This vehicle does everything right. It is fun to drive, can haul 7 people, and can even tow my 3600 lb boat with absolutely no trouble. I replaced an Explorer with this vehicle and so far have been extremely pleased with how this vehicle performs daily as well as SUV duties. If you're looking for a CUV that performs like an SUV, look at the MDX."
acura,mdx,2007,sobrien1087, 01/20/2007,Absolutely love it!,pos,"Bought the complete Sport /Rear DVD package just before the New Year.   I highly recommend this vehicle.  It's a blast to drive, stylish comfort and a real workhorse.  Safety is a huge reason for owning this newest design.  You can't go wrong!"
acura,mdx,2007,schnell76, 12/05/2006,Amazing Vehicle!,pos,"Bought an aberdeen green the weekend before Thanksgiving and could not be more satisfied with it.  Great power once you get the rpms up.  The 5 speed should have been a 6, but it's not a deal killer at all.  For me the transmission has taken a bit of time to get used to.  I think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really moves.  Gas mileage has been between 18 & 19 mpg and that is mostly in town driving.  Good for a 300 hp midsize suv.  The lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue at all.  The rear windshield is so dark that it is not necessary to buy the dimming mirror.  Love the way the AC/fan speed adjusts based upon the location of the sun!"
acura,mdx,2007,Mr. Mike, 11/29/2006,Absolutely the best mid SUV available,pos,"I'm one of those people who research purchases to the point of exhaustion prior to making a decision. Additionally I test drove all similar vehicles.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, compares with this vehicle for the price paid.  Everything about this vehicle is top tier, fit and finish, performance, luxury, reliability and safety.  I feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at MSRP!  Acura simply has produced a excellent automobile at a great price."
acura,mdx,2007,Tommy, 11/06/2006,German-like,pos,"Picked up this baby on 10/19/2006.  Had returned my Lexus RX 330 lease that same day. Compared to the RX 330, the MDX is 6 inches wider, 4 inches longer, and 2 inches taller.  But given the size and weight difference, the MDX is almost as nimble as the RX 330. (It definitely much more nimbler than the Mercedes ML class.)  The ride is pretty good, but not in the class of the Lexus.  If maximum comfort is what you seek, you can't beat a Lexus.  Acuras are very German-like, they are built as performance vehicles first and foremost.  Luxury/comfort comes behind. The GPS system and controls takes getting used to. (At least for me, because my RX 330 had touchscreen GPS, the MDX uses a turndial.)"
acura,mdx,2007,Bob, 11/23/2006,Great SUV !!,pos,"Finally a luxury SUV from Acura with good performance. I now have 1000 miles on my 07 and am very pleased with it. It has very comfortable front seats, handles very well for an SUV with good power and acceleration. I use the manual shifting capability a lot and find it very convenient to use. The sound system is excellent. When I first got the car I found myself accelerating to 70 mph to merge with 55mph highway traffic. Then I realized I wasn't hearing any noise associated with the speed and that's why I didn't realize how fast I was going. The Nav and Entertainment systems are excellent and easy to operate. The kids love the larger DVD screen. Thanks Acura for a great SUV!"
acura,mdx,2007,krafty81, 11/23/2006,Just picked it up - wow!,pos,"Picked up the car 11/21.  Drove it about 300 miles on a trip right off the lot.  Very comfortable car.  Great side view mirrors, driving position.  Custom features impressive - you can design this car however you want.  Sound system very nice, navi is the easist I've seen, although the voice commands are a little rough so far for me.  Bluetooth is awesome, linked up my phone in minutes.  Acceleration is solid, especially in the 60+ range.  Averaged 20 MPG in freeway driving so far.   Added roof rack - solid metal rack, and sport running boards as well as D/N mirror.  Perfect family car.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Kevin, 12/10/2006,Great vehicle,pos,"I have had my MDX over a week now and love it.  Never had an SUV with the power and handling the MDX has.  Even in the comfort mode, handles like a dream.  Gas mileage has been fair. (17 MPG mixed hwy and city.)  Very fun to drive.  The navigation system is awesome.  Easy to use and many features.  Stereo system very impressive. Head lamps light the road very well at night.  Seats are very comfortable and the heated seats work very well.  3rd row seats are OK.  Great for kids or adults on short trips.  The rear entertainment is very nice.  Good screen and easy to operate.  Wireless headphones give great sound.  Would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone holder, and coin holder."
acura,mdx,2007,Fernando, 10/02/2006,The most Luxury good looking SUV,pos,"Wow, what can I say.  Far most better than the competitors, wow.  I do have to say that Acura has created the best in the SUV luxury class.  The 07 MDX does drive so smooth and very fast that you feel like you are in an airplane, its unbelievable, its incredible.  Buy it, you will keep it forever."
acura,mdx,2007,John, 11/16/2006,The 07 is the best,pos,"This is my 7th SUV and my 3rd MDX. The 07 MDX is in a class by itself. I shopped other brands. Handling and quick steering response are greatly improved. Interior and exterior are beautiful. The manual shift mode is fun. The driver's comfort and positioning with instruments and gear shift were well conceived.  I would have liked to have had items in the entertainment package such as electric tail gait and heated second row seats. 3rd row seats are still cramped. Missing are the automatic wipers, and auto dimming mirror (which didn't work with the privacy glass in the rear). This is a thrilling car to drive and own.  I wouldn't trade it for the more expensive BMW X3 or Mercedes."
acura,mdx,2007,Bob Crowe, 12/29/2006,Great mix of utility and fun,pos,"Great handling for SUV, plus plenty of room for this class vehicle.  The electronics are pretty intense, but learnable and the car is full of amenities.  Engine doesn't sound as sweet as most acura/hondas but it has plenty of power. The cabin is very quiet even at speed. Leather seating is quite comfortable. "
acura,mdx,2007,Disgusted Owner, 06/26/2007,Disgusted Owner,neg,"This car has been in the shop continuously. Driver door rattles, windshield leaks, interior trim was never fastened down, window regulator had to be replaced, steering wheel needed to be completely repositioned - one thing after another.  I never thought an Acura would be this poorly built.  The engine and handling is great, the interior is cheaply made and slapped together.  Gas mileage is poor but it is an SUV.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  Dealer has worked hard to fix, but the factory sent them a lemon to sell me."
acura,mdx,2007,Mitman, 11/17/2006,Wow!! What a ride,pos,"I didn't have to test drive any other after I test drove the MDX.  I bought the car on the same day.  The ride is excellent.  I love the interior design.  With 300 hp, you will feel that pick-up.  I chose MDX with Tech package, didn't go for the entertainment package since I don't have kids yet.  Good luck."
acura,mdx,2007,Mark, 11/10/2010,Best vehicle I have ever owned,pos,Great handling and performance.  Lots of room in a moderate size.  Steering is too heavy.  Way better value than comparable German models.
acura,mdx,2007,Simon, 01/04/2007,I regret buying this car.,neu,"I have owned the car for only 6 weeks, and I have experienced the following problems. The right front door started to rattle the next day after delivery. After the door was fixed, the sunroof and the front passenger seat started to rattle. After these were fixed, the dashboard started to rattle. The AC compressor makes a loud thump when it starts, and it can repeat the start-and- stop cycle several times when you wait for the green light. The transmission makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were a 10,000- mile-old transmission. The back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is shut closed. The last two problems also occurred in the loaner MDX I got."
acura,mdx,2007,vroooom, 11/02/2006,Just buy it,pos,"I bought a TL after I had a Pilot, needless to say, I missed the room.  I have 2 small children.  This is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned.  It's powerful, quiet, refined, full of gadgets and so comfortable it pampers you. I'm getting around 23 mpg (90% 75 mph interstate driving).  No squeaks, no rattles.  Beautiful taupe interior.  My only complaint is the lack of automatic rear-view mirror.   Acura, thank you!"
acura,mdx,2007,alain, 10/07/2008,"Great, but not perfect...",pos,Bought this a year ago new and it's 13k later.  Don't let the 300hp engine fool you. This SUV has much less pick up than my 01 V8 Grand Cherokee which it replaced (I leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer is off by the way).  Rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less useful).  Also mismatching color bumper is tacky IMO for $45k car (I picked silver body which blends the best). Instrument cockpit is WAY too busy with DVD/nav system (and I'm a techy).
acura,mdx,2007,AB, 12/30/2009,Love it!,pos,"I leased Acura MDX in February 2007. Loved it from day 1. It is stylish, sporty, and everything I could have asked for. I can drive alone, or load family and friends and still enjoy the ride.  The one thing I don't like in Acura MDX are the front wipers. They stink! The wipers started jumping within few months of my buying the MDX and Acura could not fix it. So I am living with it. My transmission failed once and they fixed it because it was under warranty.  Anyway, I think MDX is a great car. I love every bit of it. "
acura,mdx,2007,Satisfied in TX, 04/19/2010,Excellent SUV,pos,"My wife and I narrowed down our choice for a reliable, slightly used mid-size luxury SUV to the MDX.  We made a great choice!  We considered a Mazda CX-9, Lexus RX 350, Toyota Highlander and Volvo XC-90 and the MDX topped them all in our book.   The MDX hugs the road incredibly better than any of the other SUVs, nearly driving itself most of the time.  The power from the 300 hp V6 is at its best from 40-70 MPH and makes interstate driving easy & exhilarating.  The interior quality far exceeds the other SUVs out there and it's tough to pass on Acura (Honda Motors) storied reliability and low maintenance. Gas mileage is average compared to others above, but the extra performance is worth it!"
acura,mdx,2007,Vladsly, 08/25/2010,One of the best cars ever driven!,pos,"AMAZING CAR! This is such a good car, I never want to sell it. It handles like a charm and it looks so good. Whenever I go to someones house they all say, Nice car! No doubt that when this one breaks, I will get another one. Great features include, awesome Navigation, Back-up Camera, DVD Player and MUCH more. I would recommend this car to anyone!"
acura,mdx,2007,J Short, 10/20/2006,Best in it Class,pos,"Just picked it up on Wednesday traded in my 03 this is atotaly different vehicle.  Power and luxury incredible, rides like a dream.  I testeed everyhting on the market and nothing is as nice."
acura,mdx,2007,Jake, 11/23/2006,Great Ride,pos,We never thought we would find a better ride than our 2004 Tahoe.This vehicle has a big car ride and handles like a sport car. We have had the new vehicle for a month and we have not seen another one on the road. I would find it hard to believe that there is a better midsize SUV on the road.  
acura,mdx,2007,New to Acura, 01/01/2007,Not a minivan,pos,"I told my wife the MDX had seating for 7, and she said we bought a minivan.  I don't think so.  With the more aggressive styling, and exceptional handling, this absolutely will not be confused with a van.  While not in the SUV class of my old 4Runner, I've come to the conclusion my time spent off-roading is in the past.  For the streets, you can't do better.  The fit and finish is excellent, there is little road noise, and electronic capabilities (Nav, voice, and sound systems) of the car are outstanding. "
acura,mdx,2007,Pete C, 01/06/2007,Nice car/SUV,pos,"Took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 3 weeks. Fuel average is 20.1. More quiet, comfortable & fun to drive than the 2004 I traded in. Great sound system. NAV has greatly improved. Really need to read the driving manual. Tried Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 but preferred the MDX ride, features & price.  Miss the automatic windshield wipers & hope I never need to replace the ""blue"" headlights. Highly recommend it."
acura,mdx,2007,zorro, 01/07/2007,2007 MDX a big winner,pos,"Great vehicle!   Comfortable and sporty ride, easy and very responsive handling (SH-AWD and ADS), very safe feeling vehicle, very good engine power, great Acura ELS Surround sound system (DVD-audio, Dolby prologic II, 10 speakers), very good speech recognition for Navigation, audio systems and Hands Freelink, front and second row seats are the most comfortable we have ridden in.  A first class SUV all around with abundant storage and passenger room.  Fuel economy on the sticker is very accurate. "
acura,mdx,2007,steve, 01/25/2007,Acura that meets expectations,pos,"Leased '07 MDX 2 weeks ago, have 800 miles so far.  With the exception of fuel economy (16 mpg of suburban driving), MDX is very much what is expected from Acura: comfort and good road handling."
acura,mdx,2007,Geo, 06/20/2007,Nice dependable car,pos,"I exchanged the 06 MDX for the 07 MDX.  I like the exterior and the interior, compare to the 2006.  The only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper front and back are plastic and makes the car look cheap.  I do not understand on a luxury $40,000 dollar car they would install a plastic bumper. Also, the car has too much wind noise and the steering wheel is unconvertible."
acura,mdx,2007,RS, 06/25/2007,Disappointed in NH,pos,We traded my wife's 02 RX 300 that never had one problem for 5 yrs. We wanted something a little bigger. The new MDX has 800 miles and the windshield wiper fell apart and scratched the glass. Also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with little to no load. Additional rattles are coming from the rear shock area.  The dealer had the car for over a week and found both wipers defective and replaced the windshield. Also replaced the exhaust below the cat converter and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was damaged along with replacing the spring itself. We picked up the vehicle and heard the same noise. I'm thinking I should have kept the 02 Lexus.
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 05/18/2007,Unconvinced,neu,"We have done 2k miles in our MDX now. Other than increased cornering ability and better brakes, this car is a step back from the previous MDX. The steering wheel is seriously uncomfortable and the centre console hurts my elbow if I am resting my arm on it while steering. The front footwells have poor room. The motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm meaning performance is more theoretical than actual. For the NE the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road so it cannot be trusted at speed. This car may be good on a track for a suv but is seriously flawed as a family vehicle for the road."
acura,mdx,2007,LexThor, 08/01/2007,Some serious design flaws,neu,"Huge side blind spots make lane changes a gamble. Uncomfortable seats.  Dashboard angled steeply away from driver so in sunlight you cannot see the digital readouts. The 4 dash A/C vents almost close when you aim them to blow air at you.  And under powered - if you think the 300hp stat means this car will outperform a 265hp V8, a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp V6 costing $15K less.  On the plus side, solid luxurious quiet ride and decent handling.  Perfect for soccer moms.  Not for inner city driving where you need power to zoom up hills and need to be aware of surrounding traffic in case of quick lane changes."
acura,mdx,2007,LC, 11/27/2006,Love it.,pos,"The MDX is a very smooth ride, easy to handle and extremely comfortable."
acura,mdx,2007,Dave, 12/28/2006,Acura hits a home run - again!,pos,"This is my second MDX - the first being an '02 Touring model with Nav. Drove it 77,000 miles with no problems. The '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power, more comfort, and improved body styling. The Tech package provides a whole new level of controls that are voice-activated and user friendly. No more touch-screen input. I'm absolutely delighted with this vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2007,Jose A Ramos, 01/04/2007,07 Red MDX,pos,Comfortable ride although I've experienced a little bit of wind and road noise.  
acura,mdx,2007,Nicollette Mourot, 10/10/2016,Good car for long time user,pos,"I love my car!!!  This car has been well worth the money we spent on it.  It is beautiful, fast and elegant.  My car has 112 plus miles and has been faithfully maintained by local Acura dealership.  Still runs like a top and is still current.
"
acura,mdx,2007,TerribleJ, 01/02/2009,Fantastic,pos,"It is a fun SUV to drive. The engine is smooth, the white lights are super bright, the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind the wheels. It handles amazingly well in the snow and would likely recommend it to anyone. I just went through a B1 service, oil change and tire rotation, which cost me $56. It seems fair compared to the maintenance on the Audi. We do a lot of highway driving and average 19 MPG and it took about 7500 miles before the service light came on. We have an Accord and Honda USA treated us well. We got rid of our Audi and went with a Honda product. We made the right choice. "
acura,mdx,2007,Debce, 01/07/2009,I love my MDX!,pos,"I have owned my MDX for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! It is so much fun to drive; looks & feels luxurious so no problem pulling up to upscale places! I didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so I keep the third seat down & purchased the rubber mat for the back. I have plenty of room while at the same time I am ""zippy""; easily pulling into parking spaces and getting around town. I love the navigation system, although it does need updating and the bluetooth is wonderful, although for some reason it keeps unhooking my Treo phone which the Acura people say is the phone's fault. LOVE IT & would buy it again."
acura,mdx,2007,wasatch7, 04/13/2009,2 years with the MDX,pos,"First luxury crossover SUV I have owned. MDX won out over the Lexus, and cost less for a very well equipped base package. Handling, power and ride are outstanding. Back seats are a little less comfortable for my tall teenagers. Back cargo area is very roomy, and easily expandable with 3rd seat folded and back seats down. I drive up snowy, often treacherous mountain canyons to ski in the winter. The SH-AWD system, coupled with the manual shift mode (for descents), is outstanding. The MDX is much better in the snow than 3 truck base SUVs, I have owned previously. "
acura,mdx,2007,Acurafan, 01/08/2008,I LOVE MY MDX,pos,"My husband and I fell in love with the MDX in 02; bought it and when we needed a second vehicle, got another one in 03.  Kept going and got the 07.  We wanted a change and test drove the X5. Nice ride but for the bang and the buck, the MDX was the clear winner!! I love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as I try to see what it can do... wow!!  No vehicle is safe but I feel a sense of security in my MDX.  Who knows... might be riding an 08 in the upcoming months.  I didn't think it was possible to improve on the vehicle but wow... they did!!!"
acura,mdx,2007,MDXOWNER, 12/20/2009,Second Acura and keep coming back,neu,"This is our second Acura (first was a 2005 TL) and I purchased the MDX for my wife because we needed more room for a growing family.  Its been two years and it still turns heads on the road (even mine after I park it) because the styling is simple, yet screams I have 300 hp under this hood.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with the Acura brand from a prestige, reliability and value standpoint.  The MDX is upscale and its easy to scoff at BMW or Mercedes because of the superb value of the MDX.  Acura has simple options and doesnt hold you hostage with multiple option packages in order to get what you want."
acura,mdx,2007,What Happened?, 02/07/2008,Terrible Tech!,neu,"Unlike the previous model MDX I owned, the new design has lost many extras and the bluetooth is extremely poor sounding! The sound is ported through the AM radio and it's extremely poor in the 07 and 08 models. I really miss the rain sensing wipers, the day/night mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel to rest my hand on long trips. The ultimate insult is that darn Bluetooth. Company in the car just laugh at how bad it is when you cant understand people while driving over 40mph. So much for the ""technology leader""."
acura,mdx,2007,sap, 10/18/2006,Thanks for the classy upgrade,pos,"Thanks for making a SUV that won't make me look like a soccer mom! What a sleek looking  vehicle. Comfort level of all interior controls is perfect. I've only had it for a very short while, but heads are turning. This is by far the best SUV of 2007 for the price and STANDARDS that are offered. You can't beat it. "
acura,mdx,2007,Jed, 11/02/2006,Awesome,pos,"Beats every expectation.  Fast, nimble, great turning radius, and full seating for 7 when necessary.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Burt, 11/13/2006,Great Handling Balance,pos,"A great car for those that need the third row but love to drive.  What really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on the Sport model.  Power is good enough, interior is beautiful, exterior is nice in black.  But this thing has fantastically controlled body motion, very little lean, good steering.  And the SH-AWD really works, rotating the car even at moderate throttle.  None of the ponderous SUV feel, understeer, etc.  We are coming from a BMW 528i wagon with a sport suspension, and the MDX is very pleasant surprise.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Todd, 01/23/2007,2007 Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"I've had my MDX for about a month now; traded in my 2000 Grand Cherokee. While I don't think this has the off-road capabilities of the Jeep, how often are you really ""off-road""? (Once in 7 years for me). The front seats are extremely comfortable and the ride is one of the smoothest I've ever had. Had a big snowstorm recently and I would classify the performance as ""decent, but not great."" I considered the Q7, XC90 and 4Runner as well. For the price, you cannot beat the standards in the MDX anywhere. Thought about upgrade to to Tech pkg, but expensive and will probably just get aftermarket Nav at some point for way cheaper."
acura,mdx,2007,New acura owner, 01/25/2007,New to Acura by gail,pos,"Researched the 07 MDX a lot before purchasing. It was worth the wait.  The 07 interior is much nicer than the 06.  We bought the Sport package and the leather upgrade was worth the price.  This car has a lot of pep and wants to go.  Can't wait to take it on a trip. The more you drive it, the more you like it."
acura,mdx,2007,chrismredsox1, 01/25/2007,Everything you've heard is true,pos,"Just took delivery of my '07 MDX sport/entertainment package SUV.  Traded in a Porsche Cayenne S.  The new MDX is just about as good as it gets.  The electronics integration is perfect, as per Acura's usual standard.  The driving experience is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size and flexibility.  The SH-AWD system with the sport package suspension gives you a great combination of pull through curves, precise handling and a smooth ride with the benefit of the sport suspension's active dampers.  You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!!"
acura,mdx,2007,Awesome!, 01/24/2007,Awesome!,pos,"I have owned over the past 5 years a 4.4 BMW X5, MB ML500, and Lexus GX.  By far this 2007 MDX out performs all the above - in all categories.  Handles like a BMW, but with more ""toys"" and better reliability."
acura,mdx,2007,car man need and suv, 02/06/2007,SUV that fun to drive,pos,I also test drove the X5 4.4 and Q7 4.2.  The MDX was just right.  All the stuff I need.  
acura,mdx,2007,Rich, 05/19/2007,NOTHING ELSE Compares!,pos,"Like BMW, Audi, WRX STI, only judge the MDX after it has a minimun of 8-10K miles.  Improvements in power, suspension performance, quietness, door seals/wind-noise occur. Fast, smooth, 300 HP. Experience 17-22.5 MPG. Computerized SHAWD/Delphi-Magneto-Rheological Shocks and Michelins, corner like on rails with no tire noise/squeal. Suspension allows powering through steep/fast turns like no other car. Comfort Switch allows MDX Sport a Lexus-Ride (leveling tar-strips!) or in Sport Mode, MDX will exceed any other SUV's handling capability. Min. hydroplaning and goes through snow like tank."
acura,mdx,2007,DisappointedOwner, 06/10/2007,Test Drive It Carefully... Major Regrets!,pos,"I have owned two other MDXs and loved them.  This one is a major disappointment.  The steering is tough.  The steering wheel is impossible to find a place to grip it comfortably.  The joystick navigation is annoying and distracting to use.  No touch screen navigation.  The rear/side blind spots are overwhelmingly dangerous.  You simply can not see out the rear/sides. The front seat feels crowded and I have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the car. The rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 of the vision of the front window.  Overall, a very uncomfortable driving situation.  Test drive it for a day before you buy it.  A ride around the block won't reveal the problems. "
acura,mdx,2007,Telee, 08/20/2007,Some Major Issues with the New MDX,neu,"Rear view is extremely limited. Very small side view mirrors and late to upload rear camera do not help. Back up lights are almost useless. The seats become very uncomfortable if you are slender. A seam cuts across your rear, otherwise they would be great. Our 2001 Lexus nav system was better that the one they pack in the MDX. The auto window lock-out locks the driver out as well as the passengers. Our dog continually lowers the windows with his paws, and turns on the heated seats both front and rear. The tail gate is slick, but the rear hatch opening is too small to fit furniture that, otherwise, should fit. The key fob is not intuitive. Take a long look before you buy."
acura,mdx,2007,Seattle MDX Driver, 09/17/2007,Great experience so far,pos,"Four months and counting in this new SUV We wanted a fun to drive, dependable SUV cut out for city and commuter driving with two kids in the back seat and with the ability to handle snow when needed.  I think we got it.  Only a couple of downsides so far. The front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in fairness I'm tall but not that tall.  Adjusting the seat to unusal configs helps when the legs start to hurt.   And the rear view camera has been useless to us so far, very hard to see in most daylight situations, at least for us.  I wish I had the rear sensors instead.    "
acura,mdx,2007,Gret SUV, 11/12/2006,SUV To Consider FOR SURE!!,pos,"This is a great SUV. I had done my research against Lexus, Audi, Toyota and Honda. This SUV offers a lot in standard features compared to other manufacturers which are all options. This SUV also has the horsepower of V8 competitors all in Acura's new 3.7L V6. This is definitely a light SUV you should consider and put on the list. I love being the only one on the road. The looks I get etc. We got the rare color Steel Blue."
acura,mdx,2007,Gary Luce, 12/08/2006,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"This is my first Acura and it sure is a pleasure to drive. Handling, braking are superb and rival my wife's Audi A6. The tech package has just about every bell and whistle you can imagine. "
acura,mdx,2007,sean, 04/20/2007,Don't be fooled,neg,"This is be our third Acura MDX and they have messed up a great vehicle.  From what used to be smooth revving motor we now have the refinement of a mid 80's buick 3.8v6 and I am being generous. Yes the car can handle but at a price of crappy ride quality, the comfort level on the sport suspension is like driving a pogo stick and the sport setting is ok as long as the road is smooth.  Interior fit and finish looks to be GM level, the exterior fit of various bits is not up to current detroit levels.  The steeering wheel is asinine with lumpy bits here and there to grab and the bottom of the triangle means there is nowhere to hold when turning a corner. If I could return it I would."
acura,mdx,2007,ralph frank, 12/03/2006,Disappointment,neg,"After purchasing I realized this vehicle is very overpriced for the quality you receive. Options such as rain sensitive wipers which were on my 06 MDX are no longer available. Very poor fit and finish, not to mention orange peel paint which the dealer assures me is normal. The vehicle is tight and confining. I think I will trade it in before I lose too much in depreciation. I would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is a very big disappointment."
acura,mdx,2007,RJ, 12/12/2006,Love my new MDX,pos,"Just purchased an '07 MDX with Tech package.   The more I drive it, the more I love it.  Takes some time to get used to all the buttons, features, voice commands, and the GPS system, but the car rides awesome, nice pick-up, and everyone just loves the look of the car.  AWESOME!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Cale Jones, 01/08/2007,Out handle an S2000 with 3 kids,pos,My MDX elite in sport suspension mode will out handle my S2000. The way that the Super Handling AWD works with the magnetic suspension it is like you are on rails. 
acura,mdx,2007,Love it, 01/28/2010,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"After a long exhaustive search for a luxury SUV which was not too big and not too small, we found the MDX. We purchased our 2007 MDX used but in like new condition. Could not be happier with the performance, style and overall handling of this vehicle. This performance vehicle is quick, agile, easy to drive and stylish all in one package."
acura,mdx,2007,John Arran, 01/10/2007,Awesome vehicle,pos,Amazing on gas for size & 300hp! Ride is exceptional and the gadgets inside are very enjoyable. Love this vehicle! Ride is best in category!
acura,mdx,2007,Pat, 10/27/2006,Incredible SUV!!!!,pos,"The prelim reviews were great, and I anxiously awaited its arrival at dealerships.  I purchased one the 1st day they were available and have no regrets!!!  It's incredibly powerful.  After driving a suburban for 6 years, I'm loving this SUV!  I've driven some great performance vehicles in the past, and this is definitely at the top."
acura,mdx,2007,daf, 10/29/2006,Best of the Best,pos,From its luxurious ride to its fit and finish - this is truly a luxury SUV.
acura,mdx,2007,Acuraman3, 04/07/2007,No Wonder it's the 2007 SUV of the year,pos,"Having owned two Toyota 4Runners, a Lexus RX 300 and a 330, and having test driven the 2007 Lexus GX 470 and the BMW X5, I can say without a doubt that the 2007 Acura MDX - my very first Acura - is the best SUV I've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.The SH-AWD system alone is worth the price of ownership. The first big snow will make you smile because you'll feel safe and secure, knowing you'll get wherever you want to go.  Actually, the SUV handles beautifully any time of year and Acura reliability means it won't be in the shop every month. The interior is classy and elegant. Comfortable and intuitive, it's the best SUV I've ever driven. "
acura,mdx,2007,Lewis Lake, 09/24/2007,Vibrates Like Crazy,neu,"This vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 MPH and has noise issues with rear windows down. Although the performance is great, it corners well, and acts like a big 4X4, it's no fun when the vibration pushes you off the highway. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem and Acura said they have company cars the act the same way. ""Live with it!"""
acura,mdx,2007,EricExcaliber, 06/02/2007,"$5000 More, Get an Audi Q7",neg,"I real let down by Acura across the board. I have always bought acuras, but this is one is a let down. It eats gas like a V8, it is very umcomfortable if you are over 5ft. It is very bumoy and the engine struggles. 300hp feels like 220hp. The center console will have you feeling you about to blast off into space. And the pencil thin steerling wheel feels like a 1980s Car. The third row cannot even fit teenagers at all. It does fell like an suv, it is more like a wagon. And for this price tag you can get an Audi Q7 fully loaded,or even a BMW X5  So i did , A Audi Q7 4.2 premium."
acura,mdx,2007,Dollar & Sense SUV, 04/25/2008,An SUV with Dollar & Sense,pos,"I bought the car on January, 2007, have test driven X5, FX45, and Lexus; however, this MDX has out performed all these others by the quality, luxury, and value. Beautiful car, consistent build quality, powerful performance."
acura,mdx,2007,Marco5, 10/23/2006,By far one of the best SUVs to date!,pos,"I love my new MDX, it drives like a true luxury vehicle, very well built, very low wind noise. I absolutely love the engine, pulls like some V8s with better gas mpg. I was a little bit skeptical about trading my 05 for it, but I'm glad I did. Price tag a little higher than expected, but I believe the car will live up to its price several times over, as many of my other honda vehicles."
acura,mdx,2007,D Taylor, 06/19/2008,Great car - horrible gas mileage,neu,"Overall this is a great car.  I've strictly driven Lexus for the past few years due to the quality and comfort of their cars/SUVs.  This is my first foray with Acura.  The MDX is a nice car that is easy to drive, although had I known I would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town, I probably would have purchased something else.  Oh, and the back-up camera does not work well if too much light is shining on the back of the car.  "
acura,mdx,2007,vc, 07/17/2008,luv my mdx,pos,"This is my second MDX after surviving a roll over in my 2003. That car saved my life. For comfort, dependability, class and affordability, this is the car for me!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Alex, 08/08/2008,Ups and downs,pos,First thing I want to say is that this SUV handles better than a vehicle this large and high should.  Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids.   The interior space is very nice.  This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips.  I am disappointed in the gas mileage.  In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg.   On the highway I get about 19.  Nowhere near the numbers advertised.  I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood.  I have had panel gap issues.  
acura,mdx,2007,Kate, 08/28/2008,my truck drives better,neg,"Between Sept 2007 and April 2008 I had 3 sets of front tires, 2 sets of back tires and it drives worse than my Tacoma!  I jumps from side to side over bumps. It's unpredictable on stopping. Honda Corp only tell me they can try and ""have it fixed""  It's been in 7 times in 8 months!  I stopped driving it in June.  Selling something to you that is broken then just ""fixing it"" is unethical.  I would suggest that NO ONE ever buy this car!!"
acura,mdx,2007,bowie, 09/11/2008,Not so good,neu,"Bought my 2007 MDX with/Tech pack in August 2007. Do not like it. The acceleration is sluggish, and the engine is noisy. The tech gadgets function well, but you have to take 20 hours to read the manual to learn how to use them. The navigation system comes with a very old map and POI database. You cannot find any place built after 2004. The navigation system also does not take latitude/longitude. The $3000 navigation system is not better than a $150 portable."
acura,mdx,2007,SteelerMan, 09/26/2008,Love At First Sight,pos,"I purchased my 2007 MDX just two days ago and LOVE it!  It rides like a luxury SUV but with the kick and sporty attitude of a TL or TSX.  The Technology Package blows my mind and I consider myself a ""techy guy""!  I am thrilled to have this vehicle!   "
acura,mdx,2007,Max, 11/14/2008,Great,pos,"This is by far the best SUV I have owned. Power on demand, luxury interior, gas mileage is all right. It is top quality vehicle, can't beat it."
acura,mdx,2007,Dr. T, 12/04/2008,MDX - Best SUV on the Market,pos,"I now have over 18,000 trouble free miles on my MDX.  It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  Very comfortable on long trips.  Performance is even better with a K&N low resistance air filter."
acura,mdx,2007,kellycrewmom, 12/14/2008,Amazing!!! Love this car!!,pos,"I'm a realtor in Colorado and went up to Whale Rock Road in Bellvue to list a home.  The owner said I would need chains to get up and down the hills.  I took a chance and drove up the hill without any issues, used the manual transmission to drive down the switch backs and snowy, icey hills to ""civilization"" and the car basically drove me down.  When I would've shifted it was already where I wanted it.  I generally do not drive off-road and was amazed at the handling capability. This car is quiet, comfortable and stylish with plenty of room. (Love the storage and 3rd row seat when needed). I'm thrilled I have the MDX!  Thank you Acura you have a fan, who is living to talk about it!  "
acura,mdx,2007,mnozek, 04/06/2009,Drives like a dream,pos,This is the first Japanese SUV we have had in a while. Last SUV's were Yukon XL and Envoy XL. This beats them out by far. Performs almost as well as our Mercedes e class but has the utility of our Envoy. We always take this on trips and it is very comfortable. The third row is great for smaller children but not so much for adults. Best SUV so far. No problems within our almost 2 years ownership.
acura,mdx,2007,JLopez, 01/04/2008,Drives Like A Car!,pos,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX. The ride was not as luxurious as the Lexus, but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drives like a car! Drove it down to Disney from NJ; enjoyed driving too much that I didn't even bother stopping (except for gas) on the way back. The kids love the DVD so much that they did not even use with their game system. MPG wasn't that bad either (averaging 19/21). Overall, I think the build and ride is not equal to that of the Lexus, but they are still within very excellent standards. I enjoy using the manual mode for better acceleration on the highways. Regularly gets looks from people -  hopefully because of its handsome styling."
acura,mdx,2007,CLopez, 01/08/2008,What a fun-to-drive vehicle!,pos,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX, and what a difference. The ride is not as comfortable/quiet as the Lexus but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drove down to FL from NJ, and was so comfortable driving that I drove straight on the way back. The kids loved the Entertainment System that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in the truck too. Averaged around 20-21 MPG on our trip, and was very pleased with the good acceleration on the highways. Constantly getting looks hopefully due to its handsome styling. My only complain is that the voice recognition falters. I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car)."
acura,mdx,2007,Pleased, 06/23/2009,Best vehicle we've ever owned,pos,"I'm two years into a three year lease and I love this car.  The only thing I would change would be the shape of the grill...THAT'S IT.  Everything else is perfect.  Great performance, plenty of power and AWD when skiing, plenty of room for baggage, great MPG for an SUV, navi system is far superior to GM's Suburban (don't have to put in park to change your destination, etc).   Zero problems...just gas and oil changes.  One beautiful car...except for the sho-gun shield looking grill."
acura,mdx,2007,cvillemdx, 07/30/2009,no regrets,pos,"After months of careful research and test drives at BMW, Lexus, Volvo, etc. I settled on the MDX without a doubt in mind. I love the way the car handles, no stiffness or resistance in the steering or acceleration.  The interior design is a little Star Trek for me, but once I figured everything out, it is a pleasure to have all the extras (XM radio, navigation, Bluetooth, backup camera, etc.)"
acura,mdx,2007,FlewByU, 08/01/2009,I keep going back to Acura,pos,"I just moved to Germany two months ago and bought an 07 MDX from another military member.  It has everything I could want.  We just returned from a week driving through the Alps and this SUV is simply amazing.  Granted, I get to drive it much faster than I could in the states, but even at 120 MPH, it was rock solid. We need the AWD for the snow and the kids stay entertained with the AV system. Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV for family touring, with cool tech toys to play with, MDX can't be beat. "
acura,mdx,2007,Don, 12/18/2009,07 MDX / Tech pkg.,pos,"I bought a new MDX in 02 and was very happy with it. The few things I didn't like were resolved in the 07 redesign. For a sport ute I'm happy with the ride quality, reduced road noise, seat comfort, power and handling. At 38 K miles the AC quit but was repaired under warranty. The 1st of 4 Acuras to ever go in the shop for a repair. I don't like the vertical spoke at the bottom of the steering wheel where my hands want to rest on long drives. I think it's a bargain relative to the price of the BMW or Porsche. "
acura,mdx,2007,Tim, 01/18/2010,"Great SUV, love it",pos,"This was our first luxury vehicle purchase. We bought the 07 Sport/Ent with 18K miles from an Acura dealership (Certified). We compare it to X5, ML, and the RX and the Acura had many more features, and more value than the competitors. Sporty feel, good power once the rpms climb, nice interior. Wish the interior was more quiet at highway speed and the LED for the sport button and the trunk release button died but luckily replaced under warranty."
acura,mdx,2007,Cat, 04/08/2010,Great trip car,pos,"Love the MDX, it is very comfortable on the highway.  We are averaging around 21 mpg in mixed driving. We bought ours used and have had a problem with the driver's side mirror rotating down in reverse, then not coming back up to the correct position. Also, after driving a Lexus RX300 the steering in this SUV makes the SUV feel heavy, not as nimble as the RX300."
acura,mdx,2007,dsjunk, 02/02/2008,Review after 8 months,pos,"This is a great vehicle but... in the 8 months I have owned it Acura had to replace the windshield (flaw causing distortion), adjust 2 of the door handles (installed wrong), replace the muffler (broken interior baffle), replace a rear strut (failed), replaced the battery (dead cell), fix the dash and trim (installed incorrectly) and other minor items.  Mine has had horrible build quality, although my dealer is fantastic. I bought Acura because we have had great cars from Honda, but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's Odyssey. But, no SUV out there drives this well. If you are considering, buy the SPORT, it's worth the money."
acura,mdx,2007,Rick From Crofton, 02/07/2008,Best vehicle in its class,pos,"We picked up our MDX in June 2007.  What a purchase! We compared all of the vehicles in the class and selecting this vehicle over all of the others from our perspective was a no- brainer.  Here we are with over 10K miles and we just love this SUV. It is so fun to drive. We got everything on the vehicle.  The technology pkg, the performance is unmatched. This vehicle has a powerful engine that truly delivers.  We did the head to head test drives with the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and other top brand crossovers so the buying decision was very easy thereafter. It outperformed everything.  Having had several Acuras in the past, the build quality is simply awesome. One test drive will sell this SUV."
acura,mdx,2007,bob, 02/10/2008,Great Car,pos,"Love this car!! I have had no problem in the first 4000 miles and am very satisfied with the overall experience with this vehicle. The ride is so smooth and the power is there when you need it.  The luxury, performance, and overall looks are worth the higher purchase price."
acura,mdx,2007,Anthony R., 02/15/2008,Top Notch!,pos,"I replaced this vehicle for a 1999 4Runner.  I also considered the Lexus GX470, BMW X5, and Audi Q7.  Extremely comfortable to drive, love the interior and all of the tech features.  First class!"
acura,mdx,2007,Rick, 10/25/2006,Just drove it from Canada to Florida,pos,"Bought it a week ago in Ottawa, Canada and drove it to Florida for the winter. 1400 miles over 3 days and it worked better than my 03 MDX but with close to the same gas mileage. Larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and finish is the greatest part. Feels like a true cockpit and the Nav System was great. Far superior to the last model. Really enjoyed the XM radio and the sound system is fabulous. The new trip computer not quite as good as elapsed time resets with each stop rather than driver resetting it. Most features were easy to operate, very intuitive. Seats with lumbar support can't be beat and I tried them all. Thanks Acura."
acura,mdx,2007,Kat, 10/23/2006,Should be the 2007 SUV of the Year!,pos,"This is the SUV to own if you want an outstanding technologically advanced, fuel efficient car with all the bells and whistles plus some you didn't even think of.  In my opinion, the Acura MDX is the best value, best performer and offers the option of 7 passengers where many only offer 5.  This is a completely new model with zip and zest that will leave any man or woman feeling lucky to own.  I'm glad I waited and didn't order something else more expensive; it was worth the wait.  We'll just spend the money we just saved on a family trip to Australia next summer!"
acura,mdx,2007,Bill, 10/31/2006,Best SUV In Price Class,pos,"SUV handling is exceptional, lives up to marketing hype. Technology is easy to use, however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of manual and voice commands. Third row seating area is of margional use (small children). Excellent power at mid and upper ranges. No early build or mechanical problems noted."
acura,mdx,2007,rg, 11/07/2006,'07 MDX,pos,"Unbelievable value, the whole nine yards.  Build quality, performance, tech features galore.  ULEV to boot.  I can picture driving this SUV for ten years, it will probably seem state of the art for the first five."
acura,mdx,2007,First new car 12yrs, 12/18/2006,First new car in 12 years,pos,"The car is just beautiful.  I got the black cherry pearl sport, fully loaded.  It's like being strapped into a rocket, what power and handling.  The fuel consumption is higher than I expected but I was told that it would take several months before the true fuel consumption is realized, I hope that's true.  I love XM and if you love music like I do, I would highly recommend getting the navigation just for this option.  I haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use much in the future.  I got the sport just because of the upgrade in leather.  The parchment interior looked too yellow, put with upgrade to sport, the leather looks much softer and not so yellow."
acura,mdx,2007,Sun, 02/01/2007,Overall a great car for its class,pos,"I looked into BMW X5, Benz M350, and Volvo XC90.   I lastly checked out the new MDX and fell in love with all the features the car has and its new look.  Definitely the most bang for the buck in every aspects compared to other vehicles in its class.  "
acura,mdx,2007,mesalum, 02/02/2007,Great 2nd Gen MDX,pos,"I purchased the 2001 MDX Touring when it was first available.  Kept it for a couple years and traded it on a Nissan Titan.  Now I am back with the 2007 MDX.  Wow is all I can say.  It's more refined than I remember the 2001.  I bought the Tech Package and I love all the gadgets.  The leather seems to be better quality.  This one seems quieter than the 1st gen.  I cannot wait for a long trip, we are planning a trip to Tahoe but there is no snow up there (Feb 1)."
acura,mdx,2007,murphys mike, 01/24/2007,Need a sports car and an SUV??,pos,"I just traded my beloved Infiniti FX for this MDX Sport. I drove the Acura just to prove to myself that my FX was still unrivaled in the world of upscale crossover vehicles. You gotta understand I loved my FX, but I loved my childhood sweetheart too and then I started meeting real women. Yikes!!!  The MDX Sport handles better than top of the line Porsche of my 70s youth. While not the briskest off the line, from 4000 rpm and above this beast will compare favorably with almost anything not in the ""super car"" category.   The blend of technology (too much to tell you about), comfort, utility, fit and finish is unrivaled.  Drive one, hear one, and make one go around a corner... then decide."
acura,mdx,2007,Corry, 02/03/2007,Best Midsize SUV,pos,"Compared with Mercedes ML350, Lexus 350, BMW X5  3.0, Volvo XC90.  Better than the ones compared to. With Mercedes and BMW everything is an option. I had a MB S430. I spent too much time repairing the vehicle. MDX comes fully loaded with all options. The audio system is excellent. It plays MP3s of DVDs. It can hold 6+1 DVDs loaded with MP3. 7 * 8.4 GB (dual layer) = approx 60GB of songs... AMAZING !! Quality of audio is also excellent.  Navigation rocks. MB navigation is like Mickey Mouse compared to this.  I never thought of being so happy of a Honda over the MB."
acura,mdx,2007,Tops No Doubt, 02/10/2007,Tops No Doubt,pos,Resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was pretty much her decision.  And her decision was just that.  Lets go buy the MDX.  Now I am a convinced owner of all the quality and comfort  Acura has to offer (which if you let my wife tell the story she already knew).  It is by far the most superior vehicle we have owned.  
acura,mdx,2007,TNCPA, 02/10/2007,Top-of-the-Heap SUV!!,pos,"With the exception of gas mileage, the new MDX exceeds my expectations - handling on par with best sport sedans, very quiet, rides better than most luxury cars.  Build quality very good. Improved overall from an excellent 2001 MDX.  Trip computer very inaccurate - overstates mpg by at least 10%.  MPG an actual 20.5 for 2000 mile trip, primarily interstate at 70-75 mph.  Surround sound system is excellent, perhaps better than my '04 Acura TL.   "
acura,mdx,2007,AcuraReview, 02/11/2007,Great job Acura!,pos,"Excellent ride and lot's of bells and whistles for the price.  Safe vehicle great for our growing family.  My wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months.  We purchased this car so she could have a safe, reliable vehicle that could also be great for kids and have some class/luxury to it as well!  Very happy with our MDX purchase!  The class leader in our opinion!!    "
acura,mdx,2007,Joe, 02/15/2007,Best SUV,pos,"This is a very fun and smooth SUV. I have owned it about three weeks, and have the best time driving it. The gas mileage is not the best but I can live with it. Do wish that the roof rails, side running boards, and side body moldings did not have to be extras, but they make the car look so much better."
acura,mdx,2007,MDX Dad, 02/23/2007,2007 SUV of the year!,pos,"I was looking for a vehicle for my wife and daughter.  I am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months and months before making a decision.  After comparing the MDX with just about every luxury suv (ie, X5, XC90) on the market, the decision became easy.  The MDX has a luxurious feel but still has a lot of function to the design.  The technology is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav, blue tooth, rear view camera, etc.).  Very safe vehicle.  After all the research I am convinced this is the SUV of the year, when luxury, quality, performance, and Acura's reliability are all thrown together.  Best vehicle we have ever owned!!"
acura,mdx,2007,Incredible by MBA, 02/28/2007,Fabulous Luxury SUV,pos,I drove the X5 BMW and the Mercedes ML class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 MDX.This vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a light jet. The technology is superb. We've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and I can't wait to drive it again
acura,mdx,2007,lsb, 02/23/2007,New MDX,pos,"Great style, power, pickup, handling, comfort.  Surprised how crips it handles for size of car.  Drives smaller than it is.  Priced better than competition for same features."
acura,mdx,2007,KC, 02/25/2007,Best New SUV Under $50K,pos,"As expected, Acura's attention to detail, outstanding quality and impeccable ergonomics live on.  The overall interior quality is terrific.  Love the handling prowess.  Takes curves like a sports sedan - well, almost.  Very good power once over 30 mph.  Very smooth suspension compliance but so much that wallowing and pitch/rolls dominate; spot on blend of comfort and handling.  Additionally, the navigation system is terrific and easy to use.  The upgraded stereo system is awesome, and the rear view camera is great.  Leather, sunroof and all the bells and whistles I could want.  Comparably equipped X5 was $14K higher - no budging.  Bottom line - best SUV available under $50K! "
acura,mdx,2007,Andy, 03/21/2007,Unhappy,pos,"This vehicle is very expensive, needs a lot to improve, power steering is very hard, wind noise, low fuel mileage, noise in front suspension."
acura,mdx,2007,rperret, 03/05/2007,Disappointed with steering,neu,"I just traded in my 2002 MDX for the New 2007 MDX and am about to trade again! The new car is significantly smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving a truck 3 times heavier. The whole driving experience is that of a much larger car then the old one, but when I get out and look at it, it looks much smaller then the replaced MDX. My wife actually has a hard time parking in small parking lots because of the steering. This is a big negative.  The build quality is superb and there are lots of improvements, but be warned the driving experience is anything but nimble."
acura,mdx,2007,Cliff Kang, 03/05/2007,MDX is excellent so far!,pos,"Excellent vehicle.  Took it on a cross country trip from CA to NY with absolutely no problems.  With highway driving, I get close to 23 mpg, but when driving around town, I usually get about 15 (I drive pretty aggressively I guess).  Build quality and design is superb, and the options you get for the price compared to cars in its class is considerable.  Only thing that I'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats, for better cargo storage.  But otherwise, excellent :D! I love my car.  I've gotten about 5500 miles on it so far in 2 months."
acura,mdx,2007,The wonder wheel, 03/11/2007,The wonder wheel,pos,I recently picked up my 2007 tech and entertainment MDX on 2-23-07. It has been truly a great purchase. I traded in a 2006 Mercedez-Benz that had multiple problems to an upgraded dream. All of the technology is great. I offer to drive my friends around just so I can feel the comfort of the seats. I am a stay home mom with 2 kids. This car has plenty of room for everyone. I highly recommend it.
acura,mdx,2007,Dr.A, 03/21/2007,Best SUV in its class!,pos,"In love with this car!  Gorgeous interior, heavy tech features without the heavy price!  Did a 7 hour road trip with family.  Wife was in back seat reclined back enjoying a movie with our son while I was listening to ESPN XM radio up front.  We had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and I was feeling good around 72 degrees since I am always warm... very nice!!  Excellent acceleration and handling.  Previous review said they had heavy steering.  I do not have this problem at all.  This vehicle has surpassed our expectations and I would be very suprised if it doesn't win a lot of awards!!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Dax, 03/10/2007,"Great, but only time will tell.",pos,"I have had my 07 MDX for about 2 months now, I love the thing from its fun to drive to its looks. Only problem was a loose rear suspension bolt that made noise over some bumps. Dealer took care of that and now its as solid as anything out there. Fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very good. Its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be if any. But so far with 2000 miles on it its great."
acura,mdx,2007,Christine R, 03/10/2007,LOVE IT!,pos,"Just got the MDX.  Love it.  It is such a great car for me.  I have owned two Hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another Honda but wanted more luxury than the Pilot.  So the Acura was the answer.  It's a great ride, everything I need.  I'm a 5'1 female and I love it.  I have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did, little guy can get in easier by himself and I use it to buckle him in without stretching."
acura,mdx,2007,Vitaliy, 03/21/2007,Unique!,pos,"This car is quite comfortable, with a 300 hp engine. A unique design inside and out. I love driving this car."
acura,mdx,2007,slysy11, 03/31/2007,Awesome,pos,"I picked up the car in Feb and after 1 month of driving I still absolutely love the car.  It drives very smooth, I have the dvd player and navi, and both are very user friendly.  I am constantly getting compliments on it and I would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! I used to drive a mercedes c240 2005, but this is much much better!"
acura,mdx,2007,Narsi, 04/18/2007,A really good decision,pos,"Bought the vehicle in February, nimbus grey with taupe interior. We were in the market for a SUV with a third row that doesn't feel heavy to drive and we have the near perfect combination in our X. We have put close to 3000 miles in it. Loving it so far. Being a tech geek, it has kept me grinning everytime I take it out of the driveway. Can't wait to take it out on a long trip. I have become a shameless show off after this purchase.  Our son loves the entertainment system, I love the ELS stereo though I still haven't figured out the speciality of DVD-A. My wife loves the navigation and everyone is happy. "
acura,mdx,2007,JohnnyT, 05/01/2007,Wow!!!,pos,"I can't believe I am saying this, but I love this vehicle! This coming from a man who wouldn't even consider an Acura product. My allegiance has always been with my Bavarian brothers but this time I wanted to be different, and besides the Wifey got the new X-5. Surprisingly enough my sled holds its own with the X-5 and its horsepower advantage. Especially using my Sports package's features gets me through the Malibu hills quite spiritedly. Enough oomph to pass on the freeways of LA and enough panache to park at your trendy diners around town. It just blends in rather than the opulent massive bohemoths like Caddies and Rovers crowding our beloved city. Overall, the SUV is a fine vehicle."
acura,mdx,2007,Fred, 03/28/2007,At 1000 mi,pos,"Review at 3 weeks and 1000 miles:  Overall, this vehicle is a home run, not even a stand up triple.  It has been challenged on mountain passes,with snow and dry pavement, the handling is like no SUV or car I have driven.  The control, especially in sport mode, removes almost all insecurity and white knuckles.  MPG: overall 21.6 at 1000 with a mix of 60% hwy and 40% city.  Snow performance 8/10. Marginal tread design of the Michelin all-seasons is the reason.  Light off road duty is very good.  Nav system is slightly superior to Toyota.  We have both.  A bit difficult to negotiate in a tight parking lot.  Flip side is plenty of room for kids and cargo."
acura,mdx,2007,nick@night, 04/01/2007,2007 Acura MDX Tech/Ent,pos,Car drives very nice and is quiet compared to other Honda vehicles using the same platform. Features (tech and entertainment pkg) are well thought-out and appeal to those who can appreciate new technology. I only have 1k miles on the clock so it's still too early to tell how the MDX will hold up. Michelin tires are very quiet and handle well. 
acura,mdx,2007,JWEISS, 04/08/2007,This is the best car I've ever owned,pos,"This is a full sport utility vehicle and a luxury car combined!!   It rides like (even better than) my Lexus ES 330 and it still does the job for skiing, surfing, and road trips!!  This car fits 6 adults in real comfort.  You could easily do 4 adults, 2 kids and a dog on a long road trip and nobody feels cramped.  This vehicle is awesome.  Took a 600 mile road trip and several coastal drives so far.  Do get the cooler to keep your beverages and food cold so you don't have to stop and buy food (helps offset the cost of the gasoline) .  I know it's not eco-conscious, but it is the most fun you can have for the money and still feel like a star pulling up to Spago."
acura,mdx,2007,consultauto, 04/19/2007,Great drivers SUV,pos,"Traded in our '06 honda Pilot for an '07 MDX, the difference between the two was obvious from the moment you drive off.  The MDX feels planted on the road with minimal roll, good acceleration.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and feel that it was a definitive upgrade from the Honda Pilot."
acura,mdx,2007,jighead55, 04/19/2007,FUN to own,pos,Bought my MDX a few weeks ago. S far I'm having a blast with it. The technology is awesome and driving is fun.
acura,mdx,2007,chennaivasi, 05/16/2007,Just love having it :-),pos,"What a fantastic one. This is our first SUV, and first luxury car.  So much difference to driving comfort compared to my earlier Camry. Just feels stuck to road, DVD is awesome, crazy voice commands and GPS is too good to be true, accurate.  Too bad I have just one so my wife drives it and I get it only on weekends... something I look forward to the whole week :-)"
acura,mdx,2007,Drew, 05/03/2007,What an SUV,pos,"Just purchased our 2007 MDX with tech package... what an amazing car.  This car has every feature you can think of.  The DVD surround stereo is amazing.  This car is actually fun to drive, and the handling is like no SUV I have ever driven (Dodge, Chevy, Toyota, BMW).  The  turning radius is amazing, take a corner and push the gas and just smile.  I have three kids ages 14, 12 and 9 and we have plenty of room.  The ease of use with the voice activation system for GPS, stereo, climate is second to none. Acura knows how to build a car!  "
acura,mdx,2007,kg, 05/15/2007,MDX,pos,"Just purchased and have not found many flaws with this vehicle at all.  Great features, fun to drive, plenty of space, and it looks great."
acura,mdx,2007,Dennis , 05/17/2007,All that and more,pos,Bought the sport with ent package in Feb and have already taken 2 trips over 300 miles.  Gotten 22 MPG ave about 70-75 on the hwy.  In town getting about 16-17.   The handling is a dream and plenty of power to spare.  Kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen to their music while we listen to ours.  Kids also love being able to bring the game cube or ps2 and I just love being able to plug it in.  Best SUV for the money.
acura,mdx,2007,fly, 03/02/2008,Best in comfort and power,pos,This suv has everyting from heads up display to nav. I love the mdx. I have taken the mdx on long trips and found the comfort level is 2nd to none. My wife will not fly so all our trips are on the highway.  Highway miles per gallon 22-23 mpg @74mph  city 17-18 mpg  The only problem I find is the gas tank door sticks when cold.  
acura,mdx,2007,ToddB, 06/19/2007,Very Nice SUV,pos,"Recently traded in my Lexus RX 350 for the 2007 MDX.  Living in the mountains of Utah I need something comparable to a dog sled.  Also needed reliability.  Not as smooth as my Lexus, but plenty of power for the steep roads (manual comes in handy).  Love the styling. It's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = ugly!  Takes a while to learn the tech stuff.  19 MPG mixed driving, mostly city. Overall, very pleased. "
acura,mdx,2007,pete, 06/20/2007,Unbelievable,pos,"Just bought this vehicle and it is best I've ever owned. 'm getting 18.5 MPG. For 300 hp, no complaints there. I got the base and added roofrack, crossbars, sport rails and daynight mirror and still came in literally 15k less than BMW, 7k less than Lexus (RX 350). Great ride, great warranty, great afterownership services through Acura. Safest SUV on road, Make this your last test drive and you will buy it; no other automaker can justify the price difference."
acura,mdx,2007,rdhaddock, 06/26/2007,Great Road Car,pos,"I've put 27,000 miles on this car in less than 6 months and I love it. It gets 22 to 24 mpg on average with mostly road miles. Handling, acceleration, and everything is great. My only complaint would be that the seats are not as comfortable as I would like for such long road trips. "
acura,mdx,2007,Tom, 07/09/2007,Nice SUV,pos,"Compared with Lexus 350, BMW X5 3.0,  Better than the ones compared to. You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!! "
acura,mdx,2007,HockeyFox, 07/25/2007,Acura Does It Right,pos,"After owning a Honda Pilot and an Acura CL type S, I am a Honda fan.  My confidence is being tested with tranny issues on the CL, but we absolutely loved our Pilot.  The MDX is a step up at every level.  The navigation system, initially appearing complex, is easy to use and very informative once you get the hang of it.  The build quality is very good with a few minor issues (one being a ding in the quarter panel when we went to pick up the car).  Power is just fine for a vehicle this size, and the interior is wonderful.  If we experience the same reliability as we did on our 2003 Pilot, we will be very happy campers."
acura,mdx,2007,ssundy, 07/27/2007,"Wow, what a ride!",pos,"I've had my MDX for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the way around. Fantastic styling, very fun to drive and pretty good on gas mileage for it's power and size. All my family and friends want one now lol!"
acura,mdx,2007,Facha, 07/31/2007,"Perfect harmony of luxury, tech, and sport",pos,"I bought this SUV early July, and am loving every bit of the vehicle. My family members including myself are owners of 5 Lexus vehicles (2 ES, 2 GS, 1 SC) and I introduced the '07 MDX to the bunch. I have no complaints so far and I love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that I would not be able to get from the RX. I test drove several SUVs (Audi Q7, RX 350, BMW X5, Buick Enclave, Chevy Tahoe, looked at the LR3, GMC Acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury that MDX offered. Navigation and voice commands for nav, climate and radio are by far the best."
acura,mdx,2007,Jake and Katie, 07/29/2007,Great family car,pos,"We absolutely love this vehicle.  It fits both of our kids (with car seats), our dog, and several adults comfortably.  The memory seats are great, being that my husband and I have almost a foot difference in height.  Does not drive quite as well as our Saab 9-3, but definitely more like a sedan than expected.  Also like that insurance barely increased (and prior vehicle was 99 Passat)."
acura,mdx,2007,try2follow, 09/09/2007,What a powerful beauty,pos,"I was driving a 2005 MDX and was offered a company car. The choice included BMW X5, Mercedes ML350, Audi Q7 and Lexus RX 350. Given my excellent experience with Acura for the last 2 years I opted for the new MDX. Acura did a great job (interior and exterior).  I love the new sporty look. The seats are very comfortable and provide good support. The 300 hp engine does a great job, sound and performance are impressive. I prefer the new navigation system over the old one. The 10-speaker sound system beats my stereo at home! My children love the larger DVD screen (9 inch now). The blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just extra careful when changing lanes."
acura,mdx,2007,Ryan, 10/06/2007,Road Tripper,pos,"We bought our MDX in May 2007 and immediately took it on a 4 month, 12,500+ mile road trip through the USA and Canada. Mountains, deserts, bad roads and good - we really put this car through its paces and have been very satisfied. The MDX drives like a car on twisty roads even without the sport suspension and the manumatic was very useful in the mountains. Interior space is excellent - we traveled with a baby & all associated gear. The nav system is accurate and easy to use. Highway gas mileage is better than rated (about 25 mpg), but city is worse (about 17). Only mechanical prob is a ""clicking"" noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to see."
acura,mdx,2007,BIgd..., 10/04/2007,Very Happy Wife,pos,"So far just getting used to all the gadgets has been a challenge. I really like the feature when you unlock it but forget something and have to go back. You can program it to lock in 30, 60 or 90 seconds after you may have inadvertently unlocked it and forgot. Great security feature. I have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy with the cruise control especially on steep hill climbs like I have in BC,Canada. I have set it at 80 MPH and climbed a 12%-18% hill grade and maintained it for the 2km hill climb. Awesome!! I actually like the navi control knob that some people seem to hate.   "
acura,mdx,2007,louieo, 05/18/2007,Super MDX for '07,pos,"Traded in '04 MDX for this year's upgrade and both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this new vehicle.  Somewhat disappointed in the rear view mirror, low quality for the type of vehicle. Great 18"" Michelin tires and the superb stereo system is a joy to listen to.  Roomy and very comfortable. Just a joy to drive!"
acura,mdx,2007,adam, 05/20/2007,I'd Rather Have a BMW,neu,"Good car, handles nicely, I expected a little more kick. The car has the technology I need but it may be a little too technologically advanced. My only complaint is that it is the ugliest car on the road."
acura,mdx,2007,Tony, 06/14/2007,"After 5,000 miles still best SUV for $$",pos,"I had written a previous post about the MDX but wanted to reserve judgement until I had more miles on it.  We just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the MDX is still the best SUV on the market today IMHO.  MPG=20.3, great reliability, comfortable and stylish interior.  Plenty of room for kids.  A lot of fun for road trips.   I have heard people say that the car is too advanced, and I don't really understand that as a negative.  The car is very intuitive.  I am no computer geek but I have had no problems learning the tech features.  If you pay this much for a vehicle, I want all these features!!  Get a lot of positive comments about the car.  Really breaks the mold!!"
acura,mdx,2007,annlee, 06/21/2007,Sweet Ride!!,pos,Exceeds every SUV I compared to. It either has it better or less expensive. This car has every feature you can think of. The DVD surround stereo is amazing (front and rear can be operated separately by driver). I am having so much fun driving it. My husband is always trying to find a reason to drive it. We traded a '99 Landcruiser and the insurance only increased $100 over the 6mos... WOW!! This car has excellent safety ratings along with an alarm system that cuts off the fuel supply.  
acura,mdx,2007,Don, 06/25/2007,One-Month Review,pos,"Like the styling and comfort, but there are things that I missed completely with the test drive. 1) The bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater as the sharp and hard stitching sits above the leather, 2) the navigation system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2D maps and ugly text for street names, 3) the AUX input requires an iPod at full volume, 4) the voice recognition is worthless and unusable, it's wrong at least 75% of the time, 5) when you drive in an ""unverified"" area (my home of 50 years) there are annoying warnings that don't go away without a lot of attention, and the worst, 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to turn a corner."
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 08/02/2007,Exceeds my expectations every day,pos,"The 2007 MDX a superb vehicle. It's truly hard to express how great this vehicle is. The navigation system is intuitive and simple to use. The voice recognition is excellent. The ride is extremely comfortable and the vehicle handles the road extremely well. I can't imagine how well the Sports Package performs. Overall, easily the best vehicle I've owned (compared to Explorer, Jeep, BMW). Highly recommended. "
acura,mdx,2007,Srid, 07/31/2007,All in one Champ,pos,"Undoubtedly this is the best of its class vehicle with outstanding bang for the buck.   I am into 3rd week of ownership, so my experience with it is minimal, but all for now I can observe and suggest that Acura improve the ride with more comfort or sportier.  Either be more like comfy Lexus or sportier like BMW.  Regardless, my experience is still minimal and as it stands I own an outstanding car."
acura,mdx,2007,Davispandk, 09/14/2007,"Awesome car, some suggested improvements",pos,"First the positive - this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. It is an awesome vehicle for sure. The technology is like a science fiction movie, at least for someone like me who has never owned a luxury car before. Everything is easy to use if you take the time to read the manual and practice. There are so many minor details that Acura does right to make this car so much more than just a car. I do have some complaints, though, and they mostly relate to practicality: 3rd row legroom could be better based on experience in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles are poorly spaced for booster seats; 2nd row climate control vents do not adequately reach the 3rd row."
acura,mdx,2007,jadladrad, 10/11/2007,traded for a Audi Q7,neg,First and probably my last Acura. Big Honda fan so had high expectations that were not met. I liked the styling and it was fun to drive but overall the build quality and use of cheap materials got tiresome.
acura,mdx,2007,Baymate Diego, 10/12/2007,Great family SUV can be improved,pos,We bought a 2007 Acura MDX tech package more than a month ago. Great handling. Overall excellent interior and exterior. Both navigation and backup camera are great additions. Vehicle is wilder than comparable vehicles so think about parking in crowded garages before purchase. We bought this over competitions because of excellent value and the 7 seat capacity. Third row seats practical only for kids. There is sometimes wind noise coming from the right side when driving on freeway. Have not figured that one out yet.
acura,mdx,2007,George, 05/27/2007,Now I have TWO MDXs,pos,"I purchased an MDX Tech with the Entertainment pack for my wife last year when it debuted.  I love it. I was driving it so often that my wife said get your own and I did 4 days ago!  I looked at the mercedes g450 but $70,000 with the options was $20,000 more than mine.  I test drove Audi G7, Lexus GX470, Volvo x90, BMW X5, Cadillac Escalade and SR ALL more expensive cannot compare to the MDX.  I purchased the Sport/entertainment Black.  Quality and reliability 10, it drives like a dream.  Great passing acceleration.  Best Nav I have seen.  The drive is smooth and comfortable. Bluetooth works well with my Verizon Treo700."
acura,mdx,2007,Paul, 06/01/2007,What a nice car,pos,I love this car. Driving is so fun with powerful engine and active damper control. I don't regret any penny I spent on this car. Well designed amenities are very user friendly. Improved voice recognition functions are so useful in inserting address on the navigation system. 
acura,mdx,2007,Malyel, 06/27/2007,An SUV for Driving Enthusiasts,pos,"After 3,000 miles I am in love with my MDX Sport. The MDX handles like a sports car. The brakes are amazing. It stops on a dime. Gas mileage is better than expected (17c/21h). Best of all, the MDX moves! The MDX has more features than any other SUV in its class. The MDX won out in our comparison with the GL450, X5, GX470 and Q7. The MDX actually drives like a sports sedan and not an SUV. The same can't be said about the other SUVs we tested."
acura,mdx,2007,Ryan, 06/30/2007,"Great car, even better sound system",pos,"I've owned my MDX since October 06, have about 8,000 on her.  Really a top notch SUV.  Ride and handling are smooth and accurate.  The interior design of the car is absolutely stunning.  Seats are very comfortable and although some controls not in the most convenient of places, where else would you put them?  There are a lot of features in this car.  The navigation and voice recognition are excellent as is the handsfree phone operation.  The most impressive feature is by far the DVD audio stereo system.  The sound that comes out of this thing is beyond description, especially if you have a DVD audio disk.  Overall, clearly one of the best SUVs out there today.    "
acura,mdx,2007,lola9, 07/15/2007,"Great, fun, quality car",pos,"After 15 years of loyal Lexus ownership, I decided to give Acura a try - so far, this seems to be a very wise decision.  MDX is a fun drive, fast, sporty, comfortable, and family friendly.  "
acura,mdx,2007,ken68, 07/27/2007,Great Ride,pos,"For an SUV I love the way this truck performs, rides and drives.  I traded my 2005 TL, which was riddled with fit and finish issues, for the MDX and am very glad I did."
acura,mdx,2007,inguinal hernia, 08/03/2007,Satisfied in Chicago,pos,"I've owned a new 07 MDX for a month now, and have driven it close to 2000 miles in city and suburb.  Comparing it to my past ownership of a Honda Accord and my spouse's BMW 5 series sedan, I think this is an excellent AWD SUV and I would, with no doubt, buy it again.  The audio system quality and navi. are noticeably superior to the bmw's.  Easy to drive around family and friends in comfort.  Easy to haul luggage and purchases from the local hardware store.  Rear view camera is indispensable (IMHO, this should be standard on all SUVs for safety).  Minor quibbles:  ""live"" traffic update is not so helpful, I prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials for commands rather than voice."
acura,mdx,2007,jaystuff, 08/18/2007,Headrest issue,pos,"About 4000 miles now. Never has been to Acura for a single problem. For the money, you get a lot of stuff. Voice recognition is for the birds. Main problem that I didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect, at a good angle for your posture, the head rest pushes your neck down !!! Most uncomfortable headrest in the industry. Acura claims that it is a safety feature, but it only works if you angle the seat back about 15 degrees!!! Mileage is okay for a heavy SUV. Get the sport package - handling is out-of-sight."
acura,mdx,2007,MDX02Then07, 09/03/2007,Finally traded old MDX and love new one!,pos,"I finally traded in my '02 MDX after nearly 6 years of hauling countless kids.  I was reluctant to let it go, because it was a great car.  When I first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big and I didn't like the grille.  I am so happy with that I let that go  The ride is fantastic, it's easy to park around the city, the back up camera, bluetooth, and navigation are fantastic.  The power lift gate is a great convenience.  The driver seat is so comfortable.  My kids are in heaven with the rear entertainment system, and I can still listen to my sounds up front.  How great is that?"
acura,mdx,2007,shl1108, 09/08/2007,Love my Car!,pos,"I love this car. I drive considerably on the freeways and side streets for my job every day. I wanted navigation, 3rd row for the kids, midsize luxury SUV. The style is great, so fun to drive and it is the perfect size for my family (3 kids). When I say fun to drive, I really mean I love to drive this car. To soccer games/practices, choir practices, school and preschool drop and pick up. It makes the necessary work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what I was looking for in this car. The upside: smooth pick up (especially at 50 mph+, like a galloping horse), real time traffic on the navi has saved me plenty of time already. My kids love the heated rear seats and DVD."
acura,mdx,2007,JC, 10/18/2007,Excellent choice,pos,"I love this car! It feels secure & solid; the handling is smooth & the acceleration is strong. The leather seats are comfortable & the sound system is fantastic; great sound quality & easy to use. The nav system has proven to be a real asset. The rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on, but gives a good view of whats directly behind the car. The climate control system has been flawless. The power tailgate opens slowly, but works great. I haven't used the bluetooth. The headlights work great too, giving a wide area of coverage. Don't know about other drivers, but I love them! Blind spot on the right rear side, but comfortable w/it now. MPG is decent; 20/22 combined driving. "
acura,mdx,2007,Scott McCandless, 10/24/2007,11 month review,pos,"I came out of an Expedition to buy this SUV and was pleasantly surprised by how much more comfortable the vehicle is than a truck based SUV.  The horsepower and performance are up from my previous truck/SUV vehicles, and so is the mileage.  Those giving the MDX poor grades for mileage are not comparing it to other SUV choices.  I regularly get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph on the highway. I chose this SUV for a couple specific reasons: I needed a vehicle that could tow my 23' boat and its trailer, but I wanted a comfortable, economical everyday ride, too.  The BMW and Lexus didn't have the tow power, or enough room. The truck based SUV choices didn't have ride & economy."
acura,mdx,2007,nvdesertrat, 10/25/2007,Second MDX,pos,"I tested the BMW X5 3.0 (too small, slow), the X5 4.8 (fast, too expensive!), the Lexus RX (nice, not sporty enough). This vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power, better handling (doesn't feel a bit like a mini-van anymore), more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel economy. Driver's seat is very comfortable for my 5'-11"" frame.  The SH-AWD system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as you accelerate. Nav. syst. has good display and gives clear and adjustable directions (from almost constant advice to concise directions). Hands Free Link hooks up to B/tooth c-phone on startup, sound system automatically switches to phone when called."
acura,mdx,2007,Dave R, 11/03/2007,Very happy with purchase,pos,"I love the comfortable ride and performance. The 10 way power driver's seat combined with the telescoping steering wheel makes it easy to find a comfortable position.  My wife and I both drive the vehicle so the custom seat, mirror, radio, and phone book settings linked to each key are great. The exterior styling is a real head turner, much better than the 2006 models. Visibility from the cockpit at night is great.  Love the interior styling and dash appearance. Third row seating comes in handy on occasion. The navigation system is easy to use and convenient. Practically every feature comes standard. Back-up camera is a nice plus. "
acura,mdx,2007,un, 11/16/2007,The vehicle that has it all,pos,"Very powerful for its size and drives like a car with the SH-AWD making it feel like one, on the most demanding curves. Brakes are stellar with the brake assist feature and with the stability assist control thrown in, your driving is completely technology assisted. We currently get about 18/23 city/hwy on premium gas. Interior is quite comfortable except for the third row which is best for kids under 4'. Navigation/sound system/backup camera/heated seats and dvd make it a nice long trip vehicle. The center console is a huge bin without any coin holders/small compartments. Road noise is prevalant at times. Tire noise is minimal. Lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for a while."
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 11/21/2007,"6 months 10,000 miles and still love it!",pos,"Bought my MDX in June '07 after testing all comparable w/3rd row seats (X5, Q7, GX 470). For the value, it won hands down. For the same items and options in others would have cost an additional 10-20K.  Have 10K miles of city/highway driving, and love every minute of driving it! It's more like a sport sedan than SUV. Ride and acceleration are excellent; seating comfort great in front & back seats. Yes, 3rd row is for kids and small adults, but if you want a full-time 3rd row, get a full-size SUV. They work great when heading out with a few extra friends. No question this is a great combination of value, fun, and luxury in SUV skin. Wife has TL-S - loves driving the X!"
acura,mdx,2007,Dan McMahon, 11/26/2007,Second and last MDX,neu,"Nothing but problems with all of the new electronics. Nav works when it wants to and always when it is at the dealer. Air bags misfunction... messages pop up dealer tells me to just ignore it. Rear camera works MOST of the time. Entertainment system not working for 5 months. Dealer wants to fix it but doesn't have a clue. I guess service personel will eventually be trained on the new model. I owned and still have a 2005, I didn't test drive before purchasing... what a mistake!"
acura,mdx,2007,jrt, 11/27/2007,Excellent Upgrade,pos,"I upgraded from an original 2001 MDX to this one and am very impressed by the quality and features they've added to the car.  Makes my old one feel very bare bones.   We did a 1,400 mile road trip over Thanksgiving with the new MDX and loved every moment.  Powerful engine, feels wide and stable on the road, tracks well through corners, good sight lines.  Very nice. The seats are very comfortable. The front seating areas are a little confining by design. Navi and entertainment systems are both very well done. Cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer MPG.  So it's not a bad balance as is.  Overall I'm very pleased with this SUV."
acura,mdx,2007,Hondafan, 05/01/2008,Best Honda Ever,pos,"I've owned over a dozen Hondas and Acuras through the years. I must confess this is probably the best vehicle Honda has ever made, right up there with such ground breakers as the NSX and s2000. Honda has simply built an SUV version of the Acura RL. I should know since I also have an RL. In all but the most aggressive of handling maneuvers the MDX matches the RL. It's very quiet with a nice engine growl when revved. Acceleration is good for such a heavy vehicle. Rear comfort for 2 is excellent. The other 3 spots are for children. Cargo space is ample with the rear seat stowed, towing performance is excellent. Competitors may be better in one category or another, but overall none is even clo"
acura,mdx,2007,CCS414, 11/11/2020,2007 MDX W/Tech Package,neu,"Bought used with around 110k miles on it. I was hoping for Honda reliability in a luxury package. That was not the case!! AC compressor went out shortly after purchase (around 115k) and ruined the entire system. $1700 fix. The AC replacement I can live with but the electrical drain/gremlin was infuriating. No mechanic could figure it out. I tried youtube and apparently electrical drains are common on this vehicle. We tried everything but it still would not start after sitting for only 3 or 4 days. Also, CD player kept making a weird clicking noise when the car was turn off. We finally just had to get rid of it.

The major upside of this SUV is the power and handling. It really does feel like a luxury touring sedan in an SUV packages. If you're willing to live with the headaches then this might be a good vehicle for you but if you want something trouble free then look elsewhere. 
"
acura,mdx,2008,Brake Problems, 10/03/2008,Brake Rotor Problems,neu,"My MDX is mostly a pleasant SUV to drive and own. However, I was surprised when I had problems with the brake rotors at a low mileage and Acura told me that I ""brake too hard"" and I would ""burn"" the rotors because of my driving style. Well, I am a rather slow driver and 70 % of my driving is highway driving. I have had 4 Toyota SUVs prior to this one and never had a brake issue. Could there be a quality issue with the rotors on the 2008 MDX? Compared with my previous Toyotas I feel the MDX seats too hard and uncomfortable on longer rides."
acura,mdx,2008,marko221, 03/02/2011,SH-AWD Will Make Everything Better,pos,"During the recent snowstorm we received at Lake Tahoe, our MDX simply blew past everyone installing chains and kept up with the 4x4 rigs with the huge mud/snow tires and lift kits. Even on icy surfaces, we held our traction. The OEM Bridgestones have 5/32"" tread left but the power distribution to the fronts, rears, or left or right was incredible! It can be monitored on the computer within the dash.
My confidence kept building during our 3-hour commute up the mountain.
A hazard warning blipped on and off when I intentionally tried to ""drift"" the vehicle on an icy patch at the gas station.
Note to all: the commercials regarding the SH-AWD are fact!"
acura,mdx,2008,raindude, 01/02/2012,Back to lexus,neu,"So i bought my mdx with 80k miles on it dec 2009.
The technology, room, power, etc were great.
I thought that this was finally e vehicle that i could run to 300k.
Not. Turns out the torque converter was going bad at 95k miles.
The dealership said that these things happen.
I brought car to a local transmission place for a better price. They said their are many many problems with the mdx and pilot transmissions.
They recommended a full trans rebuild since it would need one eventually anyhow.
Not sure why acura and honda havent corrected this but the problem has been going on for 10 years.
Bye bye acura.
Bought my lexus instead...."
acura,mdx,2008,acura08, 08/18/2010,2008 MDX tech,pos,Everything was great. Until I hit 60k miles (warranty expires) the wiper sensors and engine oil sensors got messed up. The wipers turn on and off by themselves and also the engine oil sensor. It was awesome how the engine oil sensor bugged out and I was on the highway during rush hour. The last row seats are a nice add but not for long trips. Honda/Acura is notorious for their window problem on the driver side. Driving the MDX is fun the handling is awesome I can whip turns better then a lot of sedans. Even the Lexus cant beat it not sure about the X5.
acura,mdx,2008,Chrissy, 08/28/2010,60K and still loving it!,pos,"3 years and 60 k and I still love this car.  It has been the most reliable car I've owned.  Before my MDX I was averaging a new car every year.  Two Infiniti SUVs and one Escalade later I bought this.  I LOVE IT!  It has all the luxuries for a fair price with a beautiful fit and finish.  It's definitely a keeper!  It's comfortable, fun, safe, and easy to drive.   I put a lot of miles on my cars and this one has been the best of them all.  No problems whatsoever.  Before buying my MDX I test drove every Luxury SUV on the market.  This one was the best driving, one of the best interiors, great technology, and most affordable of them all."
acura,mdx,2008,babake, 05/04/2010,Poor Acura Quality,neg,"Been having problems with our MDX since the day we bought it. After 5 attempts, the windows still squeak, the wheels vibrate, the radio loses its memory, the seats power setting has problems. Amazing that consumer report keeps on reporting Acura MDX as a top SUV pick. We moved to the Acura from a lexus RX to get a little more sporty feel and have been regretting our decision since. The dealer service people are also very confrontational - do not recommend Hopkins Acura of Redwood City CA. We are going to go trade our MDX for a Lexus."
acura,mdx,2008,chcaviar, 05/28/2018,Can't beat it,pos,"This is our 2nd MDX.  Poor mileage is because it has been mostly city driving.  Absolutely no real problems with the car.  Buying the new 2019 RDX.
"
acura,mdx,2008,G, 06/01/2008,A fun SUV with a few bugs,neu,"Bought this car after comparing with the Q7 and X3.  Very happy with the engine and chassis, not so with transmission.  Fav part is the electronic damping control - when it works.  The system went down a few times with scary warning sign on gauge - and car rides like a boat when EDC is down.  Dealership tried but was not able to fix it properly.  Will try again."
acura,mdx,2008,longtime honda owner, 01/27/2010,Great sporty SUV,pos,"I bought this to replace my 1998 5.9L Durango. The MDX tows my 4500lb boat + trailer better than the big Dodge! Yes, I was surprised as well. :-) We drive this over a 4100ft mountain pass to our cabin roughly 25 times a year. It's safe and stable in any condition. Nearing 30k miles with no faults and I like the vehicle as much now as when I drove it off the lot. There's plenty of room for my family of 4, lab and all our gear. A rooftop box makes I've added lets me take all the stuff I should have left at home to begin with. Seriously, if you are looking for a reliable, sporty SUV you can't go wrong with an MDX."
acura,mdx,2008,the man, 10/21/2007,A great car,pos,This car is so smooth. I also have a pilot and this car rides and handles much better. Has a real luxury feel to it.
acura,mdx,2008,Skillet, 05/12/2008,My $40k Gas Hog,pos,"I've had this car for almost a year now so some of the emotional thrill of the purchase has worn off. I really like the car in general. It performs well, nice acceleration, handles well and it looks good.  My biggest issue is gas performance. I'm getting 13 mpg in the city. It's not much better than an H1 or a Winnebago. I didn't buy the car for it's fuel economy but this is far below what I expected. I should get more than 250 miles out of tank of gas."
acura,mdx,2008,rfcn2, 12/01/2012,Best Handling SUV I Have Ever Driven,pos,"We bought this car the first day of 2008.
We owned at that time a 2003 MDX that we sold privately to the first person that came to see it.
We now have 45,000 miles on the 2008 MDX.


We drove most of the better SUVs that were available in 2008.
IMHO this was the best one regardless of price.
The only other one that drove about as well as the MDX and felt luxurious was the Buick Enclave.
My wife mostly wanted a 3 row vehicle so Lexus was not really considered.
The other finalist was the smaller Caddy.


To me the MDX is a great handling SUV.
It is really fun to drive.
Not a Vette, but for a big car this is the cat's meow.
Repairs have been needed but better than average."
acura,mdx,2008,mac, 09/06/2010,Rear end thump/squeak noise,pos,I love the handling of this SUV. I had my rear end noise fixed as per TSB 09-002. Problem came back after few months went to the dealer to fixed it again. I hope the parts replaced the second time will last.
acura,mdx,2008,De, 07/28/2009,Great car,pos,"I researched this car for over a year.  My work paid off. The dealership is great and the automobile is fantastic.  The only negative is I feel the paint is a little thin.  It nicks very easily.  I love the drive, the reliability, and handling. Is it fun to drive???  Really, it is an SUV not a Porsche! "
acura,mdx,2008,houston, 07/14/2008,Don't Buy It!,neg,"I purchased this car in March. I previously owned a Honda with well over 100,000 miles and loved it. So you think you are getting high quality for the money? Wrong! I have had problems since the beginning. There was extreme wind noise which they attributed to a bent windshield. The car started making clicking and grinding noises. That was the defective bushings. I have driven it exactly 16 days and the bushings have evidently gone bad again (bulletin on these). The entire dash is squeaking and they said they will have to tear out the dash to figure it out. There is some metal fluttering and continued noise like the door is open also. Buy anything else on the market and you will be happier."
acura,mdx,2008,Mary Ann, 09/02/2018,I would buy the Acura MDX again!,pos,"The car does require premium gas, but that's absolutely the only thing I don't like about it, even after 10 years.  Very minimal repairs and still looks stylish.  I love it!
UPDATE:   And now after almost 12 years, I still love it and don't want to get rid of it!  If I had to buy a new car tomorrow, it would be another Acura - maybe an RDX because I don't really need the space anymore, but definitely an Acura SUV!  LOVE IT!
"
acura,mdx,2008,UNHAPPY CAMPER, 06/05/2008,Worst new car experience I've ever had!,neu,"Bought car 2/29/08. Nightmare begins. 3/17- A/C blows hot - dealer replaces incorrectly installed refrigerant line; steering wheel shimmys during braking - dealer turns rotors; radio won't hold presets -  dealer reprograms key fobs 4/7- steering wheel still shimmys under braking - dealer replaces rotors and pads; radio still not working - dealer states ""it works now"" 4/15 - radio presets disappear again - dealer replaces radio tuner 5/22 -  radio still won't hold presets; Acura regional rep states ""there's no remedy""; problem is under investigation by Acura engineering; 6/4 - Acura customer svc rep states they know about the problem but there's no known date when problem will be resolved"
acura,mdx,2008,charles, 11/06/2008,Touch choice,pos,"This is a good car. Good power, great ride, it has a sporty suspension that can take jumping a curb or ramming through uneven pavement going 60 mph. So that's a plus.  The interior is nice, good heated seats useful, excellent rear view camera.  One problem: the gear shift, wiper controls and light controls are less than easy to use.  First the wiper and light controls should be lit at night: they are not.  The biggest issue I have with them is that they lack the European feedback that BMW offers, i.e., I like to not have to look down to see what gear I'm in, what level wiper I am on, or what light is on.  If it would work by just feel alone, Acura would do well."
acura,mdx,2008,Owen, 09/16/2016,Great car,pos,"Only con is that it's a gas guzzler.  Otherwise I love this car
"
acura,mdx,2008,David Johnson, 07/14/2016,Good choice for a used vehicle,pos,"This car has a lot of nice features that are not normally considered when looking for a new vehicle:  handle grips for getting in and out, sunglasses holder above the mirror, hidden storage area inside the shifter console.  I bought mine used, have had it for four years, and am  very pleased with its comfort and performance.  Dealership maintenance can be expensive but a good local shop can keep it running at an affordable cost.  Head turning quotient is excellent.
"
acura,mdx,2008,update after 9 month, 05/29/2009,Update after 9 months,neg,"MDX performs well and is a safe vehicle if you can start the vehicle!  I have had mine in the shop for 20 days and Acura customer service is horrible!  I have asked to speak to managers (who were worthless), called client services, and even wrote a letter to headquarters with no resolution.  The Acura dealership gives me the run around with what exactly is wrong with the vehicle.  First it was the battery (and tried blaming me for leaving lights on when they turn off themselves!), then the entertainment system, and now it's the power tail gate!  Don't spend good money on a company that doesn't care about satisfying a customer once the sale is made!"
acura,mdx,2008,wj, 06/25/2008,Shamefull quality of Acura,neg,"Bought the ""best"" end of MDX and end up with worst nightmare. The quality of the car is a shame. Been back to the dealer 9 or 10 times for repairs and repairs. Defective mirror, roof molding, gas door assembly, steering wheel, front suspension defects. Customer services are horrible both with the dealer and especially the Acura reps. Their attitudes are that you bought the car and you have the problem. Gas mileage is terrible, remember that with current gas price."
acura,mdx,2008,Disappointed, 06/22/2008,Should've bought the CX-9,pos,"Was shopping for a replacement vehicle for my Honda Pilot late last year and was looking at the Mazda Cx-9, Toyota Highlander and the Acura MDX. Narrowed it down between the Cx-9 and the MDX and chose the MDX based upon the Acura reliability history.  Now looking back I wish I would have selected the CX-9 as my MDX has numerous issues that should not accompany an Acura.  My radio randomly resets all the preset settings.  No one can understand anyone in the car using the Bluetooth.  When the moonroof is open you cannot read anything displayed on the radio. Rattle coming from back cargo area, etc. At this pricepoint, you get much more with the Cx-9."
acura,mdx,2008,John Vaughn, 07/06/2008,Horrid Reliability,neg,"Just too many issues to list here.  The main ones are the suspension defects for both front and rear of vehicle.  The front lower control arms busted twice on mine just from every day normal city/high-way driving - no offroad use at all! No aggressive driving either.  The rear suspension sounds as something is going to break off - Also ""repaired"" twice... so they say. Problems still exist.  This vehicle has a lot of problems and Acura refuses to work with the customer."
acura,mdx,2008,Bill, 01/07/2009,Not worth the money,neu,"Problems galore - AWD problems 2 times - Wouldn't start due to AWD problems - replaced DVD player 3 times - side dash panels replaced 2 times - seats losing color after 20k miles - replaced batter after 12k miles - front rotors warped after 10k miles.  I was a lover of Acura, they have really changed in quality for the price."
acura,mdx,2008,of, 07/15/2008,Great SUV,pos,"Bought this vehicle after extensive research.  After narrowing down to X5, MDX and Highlander Hybrid, MDX was the clear winner.  Owned CL and TL-Type S and liked the included standard features as compared to other luxury vehicles.  Main complaint is the required premium gas and gas mileage.  I also have had the thump, thump after starting and accelerating to 20 MPH.  Took to the dealer and they identified it as a ""bushing issue"" which there was a service bulletin for.  They made the repair, but still have the thump.  Will have that checked out again at next oil change. Overall, very comfortable and great handling."
acura,mdx,2008,oscarkat3, 10/22/2008,Update after 10 months,pos,I still love driving this vehicle but the quality is a bit of a let down.  There are a few rattles including a loud one from the passenger seat.  The radio settings malfunction sporadically. The A/C makes whistling noises that sound like brakes squealing.  The dealer finally acknowledged some of the problems but they never adequately addressed all the problems either.  These are minor problems but a disappointment because I had a higher expectation of reliability.  I still love all the positives about the MDX.  I plan on keeping it for a while but I don't know if I will buy an Acura again?
acura,mdx,2008,Wanna be luxury, 10/01/2007,Luxury?,neg,"This vechicle is adequate and has a smooth ride. However, the interior has too much plastic and is uncomfortable for a ""luxury"" SUV.  I feel I was pressured into buying the MDX and would caution others to look at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus before buying.  Even the Murano is competition and is 12k cheaper!  I feel like ripping out the corning looking dash.  The voice recognition is distracting and Acura should scrap it.  The steering wheel grip reminds me of my father's 1966 Chevy.  It is way too thin.  Also, the seats are way too firm.  I have to send them out for foam to be added.  The DVD player cost is a ripoff but it's the only way to get the automatic tailgate."
acura,mdx,2008,PBenjung, 09/23/2007,Great Handling Plus Super Navigation System,pos,"Bought last week and am enjoying the ride.  Excellent acceleration, transmission shifts very smoothly, handles great around corners.  Interior fit and finish is good.  Still figuring out nav system but its mostly intuitive and a great asset.  "
acura,mdx,2008,Randall Hazzard, 11/12/2007,Mildly Disappointed,neu,"Performance and fun to drive. Love to hear it rev. My gas mileage is poor at 16.2 MPG. That is a mix of 60% highway and 40% city. Reliability and quality is less then expected. Slow leak in tire that dealer wanted to charge me $380.00 dollars to replace because they cant find the link but acknowledge the leak is there.  Needed to jump start 3 times. Twice because little dome light was left on by kids. Once because of a draw off battery that has been difficult to trace.  Mirrors don't adjust with change of driver in preprogram settings. Dealer says this is normal but if you can change my XM stations with different drivers, you can certainly adjust mirrors."
acura,mdx,2008,pdx family, 11/14/2007,Exceeds Expectations,pos,"We have had the 2008 Acura MDX for a month now and couldn't be more delighted.  It is replacing a Chrysler T&C.  My ratings are based on what my expectations are in this class of vehicle.  The size is perfect for us, it seats 5 easily and the +2 rear seating is quite acceptable though the access is difficult.  The ride is comfortable, firm and responsive. Sport upgrade is worth it. The navigation system is outstanding and can be operated while moving.  You must read the manuals to understand all the features. The gas mileage we have gotten is significantly better than EPA ratings. We got 25 mpg on a 200 mile x-mountain trip and see about 19 mpg in mixed town driving. "
acura,mdx,2008,josephd05, 05/21/2008,Great CUV overall,pos,"I am 6'4"" and find the seating comfort to be superb.  The Sport suspension is fantastic.  In comfort mode, it soaks up all the bumps.  In Sport mode, I feel like I'm driving a sports sedan.  This is a fantastic vehicle, but not without faults. 1. AM radio sounds terrible, very muffled. 2. Telescopic steering wheel should extend out a couple of more inches. 3. Bluetooth is okay, but does not automatically activate if I make the call from my blackberry.  You have to make the call from the car itself, very annoying. Thats about it.  Overall I am very pleased."
acura,mdx,2008,JP, 05/27/2008,Super Handling AWD,pos,"One of the best handling vehicles I've ever owned.  Feels much more like a sedan than an SUV (once it gets rolling).  Averaging about 20 MPG, feels like less since the tank is relatively small.   Stereo is very good. Oil changes are expensive since it requires synthetic oil. "
acura,mdx,2008,C Turner, 08/26/2018,Best car ever!,pos,This was the best car I’ve ever owned.  The reliability and comfort were outstanding.
acura,mdx,2008,pink panther, 07/30/2008,Not a luxury SUV,neg,"Even after a few days there were problems with this SUV.  Nothing really big but things detaching, safety belt  not working (twice).  This SUV is characterized by poor quality built and an overall blunt drive.  The cargo space is quite big and the third row sat functional for kids.  Burt for the price tag you should get better drive quality and certainly better build quality. The bluetooth function is very poor and does not synchronize with most phones.  The dvd system does have some problems too.  Poor fuel economy.  Acura compares itself to BMW but they have a long, long way to go"
acura,mdx,2008,namdxowner, 09/09/2008,Excellent Value for the money,pos,"The 2008 MDX is a great luxury family SUV. The MDX rides like a car and makes my wife feel safe on the road.  The last row seat is only useful for kids under 10. However, two features should have been standard with this car."
acura,mdx,2008,I'm Dissappointed, 10/19/2010,Acura doesn't stand by product,neu,"Nice driver, poor quality.  When I hit around 30,000 miles I noticed my lower paint chipping badly and starting to get rust on bottom of my mdx.  Went to my acura dealer to see if they would remedy the problem.  They will not stand by their design or workmanship.  On new mdx's they added a plastic strip and plastic flare guard on door. So they know the design was bad but will not fix the problem.  My 2nd mdx, also have an rdx, will never buy another Honda product.  There are many other nice suv's out there."
acura,mdx,2008,gamerchick, 06/14/2010,Won't buy it again,pos,"After almost 3 months of owning it, I got a leak from the edge of sunglasses holder. I brought it over to the dealer ship, they didn't find anything wrong with it. Soon after, My memory seats are not working at all. It takes lots of pushes to get the seat moved to the right position. I brought it to the dealership again. when they tested it, the button worked fine. so they said they couldn't do anything till it acted up. And of course after I got home, the memory seat didn't work. Long story short, this issue is still not getting fixed yet.  I would not buy Acura again."
acura,mdx,2008,SXY, 07/05/2008,"Lives up to ""Sports Sedan of SUVs"" label",pos,"Bought the MDX for utility, but drive it for fun now.  I have an older Audi A4 quattro sedan, and was looking for a larger vehicle with more reliability for my weekend golf and ski trips.  Didn't think I would prefer driving this full time.  It corners as well as the A4!  I can also load lots of gear in the back, and rear seat passengers sit in comfort.  I compared this to the BMW X3, X5, 328xi wagon, Infiniti EX35, FX35, and the smaller sibling RDX.  The MDX has an unbeatable combination of performance, utility, luxury, and price!  Yes, price!  While gas prices are high, you can get this vehicle for under invoice prices!  "
acura,mdx,2008,Salil, 09/30/2007,2008 MDX with Tech Package,pos,"Just purchased the 2008 MDX with Tech Package. It's a great solid SUV with AWD std. This SUV is very good compared to other luxury SUV (the lexus RX350 is too small inside, the BMW 5 series is too expensive, the Cadillac SRX is too much of a station wagon, and the Escalade is too big). We love the backup camera and the navigation, worth every penny. I would say Acura has done a wonderful job outside and inside, although there are some cost cutting methods implemented like the door handles. I really wish the tech package had the automatic trunk (hatch) release where is opens up completely. You have to buy the Ent. Pack to get that. Overall it's a great SUV at this price point."
acura,mdx,2008,Nick D, 03/19/2018,Love this car,pos,"Solid, great ride, excellent pick up. Other than the gas mileage, excellent car!  Strong performance is worth the extra gas cost. Strongly recommend it.
"
acura,mdx,2008,OC MDX, 06/02/2008,Best For Four,pos,"If you are moving 4 adults, this is the best vehicle in the segment.  Lots of others have uncomfortable second row seats.  It is as fun to drive as something this size can be.  Great power to weight ratio once you are rolling.  Great highway cruiser, effortless and it does not wear you out in transit.  We have not gotten to really use the 4WD yet.  We have had it for 7 months.  "
acura,mdx,2008,CDouty, 06/06/2008,The jury is still out,pos,"I've had my MDX for three weeks and can't say that I love it. Chose it over RX350 because I wanted something different - around here if you drive an RX you see yourself coming and going. Had 3 MB MLs, very happy with them, especially the last one, but didn't like the new ones. The MDX feels very solid and safe, and my daughters think the interior is huge. It is no longer than our ML, but it is wider. Acceleration kind of sluggish, mileage so far not as good as my MLs. The interior looks cheaper than my 2005 ML, but in fairness, so did the standard interior of the new MLs. Too much gadgetry for my taste, but my husband drove it to work one day and loved it. Hope it grows on me."
acura,mdx,2008,Edmund, 06/10/2008,Love this car but...,pos,"This is my 2nd vehicle from Honda first being an Odyssey, which was great except for the run flat tire issues.  I sold my '07 X5 3.0 & leased this car and saving a lot of money on the monthly payment. Compared to the X5, the MDX is roomier, more high tech, better acceleration & breaking and priced well below the X5. However, there is no comparison when it comes to build quality and attention to details as the X5 wins hands down."
acura,mdx,2008,HI MDX, 06/14/2008,A Good All Around SUV,pos,"Had this SUV for 2 months now.  I had more problems with customer service from the dealship than the vehicle.  I did have the b-pillar plastic trims replace because they were bowing outward and the plastic trim on the side of the passenger side dash.  The adjustable rate shocks are worthless.  Comfort and Sport modes feel the same, very spongy."
acura,mdx,2008,B'ham Alabama, 06/15/2008,SUV version of the TL,pos,"I've owned two Acura TLs previous to purchasing the 2008 MDX. The MDX feels like and handles like the TL. I'm very pleased so far. The MDX doesn't have the spunk that the TL did, but I appreciate the compromise because it gets fair gas mileage for a mid-sized SUV. My wife and kids love the MDX."
acura,mdx,2008,Jason, 06/15/2008,Great total package,pos,"My wife and I wanted a vehicle that could fit a growing family, carry a lot of stuff, and have AWD. We looked at the MDX, Highlander, Acadia, 08/09 Pilots, and CX-9. Final decision came down to MDX, CX-9, and Highlander. I've always liked the MDX since 2001, and with the dealer incentive, it made it easier to justify the price jump. The MDX drives very smoothly with ample power. Handling and comfort is very nice for a vehicle this size. The interior is nicer than the competitors although the GT CX-9 is pretty good, too. The exterior looks rugged yet has enough curves to avoid being boxy. Have not owned it long, but I expect typical Honda/Acura reliability."
acura,mdx,2008,twosweetbabes, 06/30/2008,Pleasure for All,pos,"As a busy mom of 6 year old twins, I needed the size of an SUV, but didn't like the size of my Expedition.  My kids love the ease of this vehicle and I love all the bells and whistles.  The navigation is by far the easier I have ever used, the voice recognition is very useful, can command even climate control!  All controls are easy to use and the dashboard is just beautiful.  Very smooth ride and an absolute pleasure to own.  Fuel economy is not as good as I had hoped, but to be expected in this size vehicle/motor.  I would recommend the MDX to anyone w/ children, my kids can open/close the doors w/ ease and the back seat is very comfortable.  The safety features are top-notch as well."
acura,mdx,2008,cb, 07/11/2008,Solid ride,pos,"So far a great purchase.  Gas mileage has been better than expected.  Ride is smooth, shifts quietly, handles very well, lots of power, brakes are very responsive.  Plenty of leg room.  Base model is very well-equipped with everything we wanted."
acura,mdx,2008,MeBuyToo, 07/14/2008,MDX Tech w/ PTG - Steel Blue,pos,"Great ride; words cant express how much I love this car. The car is nothing but classy inside and out.  It stands out on the road and it's always the best looking vehicle in the parking lot.  Kudos to Acura for coming up with technology ideas that leads us in the 21st century.  Nav is working great; traffic incidents works.  Hands free link works.  Climate control is really good; super handling, plenty of go power; stereo sounds great. The voice commands works well for me, even with the windows down.  With all its features it's best to get to know the voice commands. Thank goodness they work.  Considered Lexus RX350, BMW X5, Volvo C90.  MDX design and Technology value outstanding.   "
acura,mdx,2008,jp82765, 07/18/2008,Great SUV for family,pos,"I looked at many luxury SUVs and loved the MDX. It is extremely spacious, comfortable, fun to drive, navigation is great, sound system is great, and handles very well. The only thing it lacks is it could use a smoother ride. The ride is not as smooth as the Lexus or EMrcadise, but it is also much less. Great for 2 kids and 2 small dogs. I have yet to experience any problems with the truck and the fuel eco. is average for an SUV. "
acura,mdx,2008,MeBuyToo, 07/22/2008,Great Car,pos,"I love this car. It gives you a lot of confidence on the road.  It has good pick up, it's quiet, pretty smooth, it feels safe, the music sounds good, love the navi, especially getting the traffic incidents in the morning; I havent had any problems to report.  I researched this car pretty much in depth before buying it, so its pretty much what I expected it to be. I considered a RX-350 test drove it twice; test drove the MDX twice.  I felt the MDX had much more going for it in terms of style, technology and the MDX was packaged much better."
acura,mdx,2008,David, 07/26/2008,"Love this car! Sold my ipod, though.",pos,"We absolutely have loved owning and driving the MDX.  We traded in a Tahoe Z71 and thought we wouldn't have enough room (two toddlers, stroller, large dog), but we think we have much more usable room with the lower doors and fold-away third row seat.  The rear-seat DVD controls are all in the center console - fabulous for parents of toddlers; they also have a remote control that older kids can use.  The navigation system is easy to use and loaded with restaurant and hotel info.  The acceleration is brisk and driving is very enjoyable.  I hate saying it, but it does drive like a (powerful) car.    "
acura,mdx,2008,bruno, 07/25/2008,Great luxury SUV,pos,"I bought this car after researching many. It has the best of everything. Most room, most comfortable, great sound, and very spacious. The Lexus and Mercedes were too small, the BMW too rough of a ride, and the Porsche too expensive. Perfect for the price. The only thing I can complain about is a slight tire noise it has, but so did all the other SUVs"
acura,mdx,2008,Boris Milev, 07/28/2008,This is exactly what I was hoping for!!!,pos,"Acura has done a great job. I was originally looking at VW Touareg which I still love but since Acura arrived to China I fell in love with this car.  The interior quality is slightly inferior to Touareg but otherwise it is a great car. Industry-leading SH-AWD (Honda is one more time riding the waves of innovation) and superb GPS system are just awesome. Feels and drives like a luxury sedan. Offers plenty of space (I am 6'3"" tall). Sound system, air-con are just great."
acura,mdx,2008,Tim, 08/02/2008,Great SUV,pos,"I'm in the market for a new vehicle to replace my other car and since I have been relying so heavily on consumer reviews from this website, thought I would write one for the MDX.  It's a great car - very reliable, no problems whatsoever.  Quiet, luxurious interior, tremendous AWD handling, smooth transition, nice power, flexible interior.  Fuel economy is not great - I get around 23 MPG on the highway at 73 MPH with cruise set, but around 17 in town.  The car is just awesome and now that I am looking for new cars again to replace our other one, I am focused on the Acura brand for its quality.  If you are in market for upscale SUV, this is the one to get."
acura,mdx,2008,MSW, 08/08/2008,"So Far, So Good",pos,"The car is very comfortable even for a 6'6"" guy like myself.  The ""sit test"" eliminated many other models. I've only had it for 2 weeks, but so far, no major complaints.  I got 17.3 MPG on the first tank in mostly rush hour traffic which was surprising.    "
acura,mdx,2008,wtliao, 12/18/2007,Best Luxury SUV in the class,pos,"This is my first SUV after driving sedan for 15 years. MDX drives like a sports car! Love SHAWD handling and ride quality is comfy and quiet. The 5-speed auto transmission works flawlessly. I should've bought the sport package for sportier ride and sexy sport rims but we figure save additional 2K for my kids education funds. Navigation system is easy to use with voice recognition system. I think it's the best luxury SUV in this class for a 45K value! Complaints: Bluetooth phonebook import only works for very limited cell phone models. Gas mileage isn't great, only 17 city/21 highway, but it's a trade off for 300HP & SHAWD, I will never regret."
acura,mdx,2008,Tyler, 08/19/2008,Sporty,pos,"This is a great SUV with superior handling, comfort, and overall appearance. Fuel economy is edging toward the v8 area, but considering the size of the mdx, it gets pretty good mileage. Ride is very smooth and the 300 hp gets it up and going quickly. Recommend the mdx to anyone looking into an SUV with the performance and luxury you get with Acura, and the reliability you can expect from Honda."
acura,mdx,2008,Todd, 08/24/2008,Great quality car,pos,Second MDX we have owned.  First generation was good but unexciting.  New MDX quality matches all of the German competition with Honda reliability.  Very solid feel and intuitive electronics.  Nav and bluetooth are great.  ELS sound system is excellent - especially when surround is turned on.  
acura,mdx,2008,BH, 09/03/2008,Great SUV that's Fun to Drive,pos,"Compared to Highlander, X5, 09 Pilot, and GM SUVs.  MDX was best compromise.  Owned a 2002 model that was very reliable.   "
acura,mdx,2008,DG, 09/03/2008,"Love it, Love it, Love it",pos,"Looked at everything out there and the MDX won hands down.  Ride is excellent, handling is great, sound system is incredible.  Voice activation for almost everything you want to either control or get information on. A little temperamental with recognition of commands but if you're clear then it's OK.  Blue tooth is great.  Added chrome side steps, body molding and luggage rack.  Black on black combination turns alot of heads.  Acura doing great financing and going way low on pricing.  First time I ever owned an Acura, will definitely consider Acura for other vehicle purchases.  Lots of power in engine although premium should probably be used most of time."
acura,mdx,2008,DisplayName, 09/05/2008,Acura worth every penny,pos,"Purchased an 08 MDX a month ago.  Researched with great detail to determine which mid-sized SUV I would be the best choice.  I looked at BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Mercedes ML, Audi Q7, even Chevy Tahoe LTZ and concluded that the Acura was the best choice for the money.  Hondas/Acuras are legendary for thier reliability and resale value.  All things considered Acura is #1. Overall the MDX is a fabulous vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,Karigirl, 09/06/2008,Awesome Vehicle!,pos,"I leased my new Acura MDX almost a year ago and still love it every time I get in it.  My previous car was a 2004 Acura TL and I thought I couldn't find a vehicle I loved more than that until I got the MDX.  The handling, the transmission, the power, the comfort, the styling, just about everything!  I wish the gas mileage was better but I am lead-footed and I am averaging 17 mpg.  When I drive mostly highway, I get closer to 22.  We recently bought a second car, an '02 Maxima, and I couldn't wait to get back into the Acura. I forever will be an Acura fan!  Best cars on the road, in my opinion (well, at least in my price range-LOL!). Oh, and did I mention, I have the BASE model!"
acura,mdx,2008,Cindy, 10/05/2008,Better mpg than advertised,pos,"Shortly after buying our MDX, we went a 2,000 mile trip, mostly freeway miles with lots of mountains, averaged 22.9 mpg. That was a relief as I was fearful it might be even worse. The more we drove it, the more we liked it. Great combination of fun, comfort, and utility. Better visibility than originally thought. Never met a hill we couldn't keep accelerating up. I am almost 6'2"", my husband is 6'3"", we both have plenty of room up front and in the rear outboard seats, but the center second row seat is not for full- sized adults. This is basically a 4 person vehicle.  My previous car was a 2006 TL, which sat too low for me, the MDX has a good step out height and is easy to get into and out of."
acura,mdx,2008,nic, 10/16/2008,best suv on the road,pos,"Great ride for the buck, we love car like ride. Great performance inside and out, Acura did a great job building this luxury suv, anyone who likes to drive an suv this one is definitely the pick"
acura,mdx,2008,nemavezee, 10/31/2008,Another great Acura,pos,"Traded in 04 Pilot which was an extremely great vehicle - but this is sooooo much better.  This handles like a sports car, when in sport mode.  There is no wind or road noise. No rattles.  OK fuel economy, considering it's an suv. SH-AWD is truly amazing combined with Dynamic Ride Control in sport mode.  My other car is an 04TL 6MT/nav - no issues, love the car. Looked at Audi Q7 before MDX and I liked it, but MDX felt better during test drive, and handling is better on MDX. Acceleration seems smoother with MDX, and feels more powerful at any speed. Transmission (too bad only 5 speed) is very smooth;  This is my 4th Acura so far - and so far very pleased with all of them. "
acura,mdx,2008,Addy, 11/22/2008,Reminds me of my BMW 540i. Very elegant.,pos,"Traded in a 2006 Toyota Sienna LE for the '08 MDX Sport with black on black. Unlike many other autos, this SUV is truly unisex. I got this for this for my wife but would love driving to work ;-)  It really reminds me of the BMW 540i Sport I used to drive some time back. Do not expect a Lexus RX style smooth ride with the Sport package. It's a road hugging SUV, with tighter steering and superb pick-up. The 300 HP engine is pretty responsive "
acura,mdx,2008,Gurm, 11/27/2008,Excellent SUV... way to go!,pos,"I bought this 2008 Acura MDX sports new here in state of WA 3 weeks back... drives like dream. I chose it over Lincoln MKX, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5 and Lexus RX 400. MDX is very sporty both in looks & driving with option of comfort mode just by pressing a switch (but you'll be tempted to keep it in sports mode). I drive Audi S4 too & still respect Acura's sporty drive for an SUV. The Acura navigation is very easy to use, bluetooth & handsfree link are nice additions too. Suggested improvements below."
acura,mdx,2008,Gunn, 12/13/2008,A nice car from Acura,pos,"Before to buy this car, I have looked at Lexus 350, ML350 and CX9 finally choose this one because of its price, equipment and 7 passengers capacity.  I have owned this car for three months. It works great with no problems at all. Just enjoy the fun when drive it. This is my first Acura, some of my opinions are: Gas mileage is quite low (13 mpg) in local roads. When slowing down speed, transmission gear shift is noticeable. Comparing to X5 3.0 (my other car) acceleration and handling is inferior even MDX has more powerful engine.  Cabin noise level can be lower."
acura,mdx,2008,JamesT, 12/12/2008,Happy Buyer,pos,I purchase my MDX with the tech pkg a week before a taking a long thanksgiving trip out of town.  I must say that this vehicle is truly amazing. I traded in my BMW for this vehicle and this vehicle is every bit as good. I drove the BMW X5 and Infiniti FX series and the MDX proved to be the better value and overall better vehicle. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.
acura,mdx,2008,qwik_footed, 12/27/2008,The Verdict after 1 Year of Driving it..,pos,"Had the car 1+ years now and can now give objective feedback without the bias of ""new car purchase"" emotions.  My wife's been the primary driver to haul around our daughter (now 16 mo. old) and she loves it.  Bold exterior style & big interior compared to other vehicles (RX330, FX35) was a big reason for buying.  We went with the Entertainment system as it was the only way to get the power tailgate at the time, but it's been great for entertaining the baby on trips. The car has been perfect EXCEPT for a constant, infuriating rattle around passenger door area (even at low speed) that shouldn't exist on a $40k car (dealer couldn't fix). Overall, love it, but it's really a 2nd tier luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2008,JERRY, 12/30/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"I bought this car about a year ago and have about 13500 miles on the car. This is a really great SUV. Remembering that this is an SUV the mileage is not too bad. I get about 17-18 mpg mixed (more freeway) and about 21-22 mpg freeway at an average speed of 75-80 mph. The back seats are comfortable. They can recline a little but not all the way flat. The third row seats are only meant for kids. Have had 2 problems so far. The air vent on the top of the dashboard pop out and was fixed by the dealer on the third try. I told them glue it down. The CD player jammed and was replaced by the dealer at no cost. All in all, I am very satisfied with this car and have already recommended it to friends."
acura,mdx,2008,Farid, 01/10/2009,Really Satisfied!,pos,"I'm a car enthusiast and then for buying this car I searched and test drove many cars during a 3 months period. Between all SUVs that I tested - such as BMW X5, BMW X3, Mercedes ML 350 & 500, Lexus RX, Mazda SUVs and many others - I am 100% certain that you can not find such a combination of handling, comfort, space, reliability and design with a very competitive price in another car. Also I love the technology package and I think that it has one of the best navigation systems. I have driven the car for near 15 months and 18000 miles and I've never had any problem with it. I think the seats are very comfortable with a good design. Handling is awesome and driver's position and view is perfect."
acura,mdx,2008,comet123, 01/22/2009,Nice SUV,pos,"Have driven 4,500 miles. Overall, great vehicle. In the snow is great. Solid like a tank. "
acura,mdx,2008,mchina, 02/05/2009,"Always fun, Never bored!",pos,"I test drove some of the other luxury SUVs out there, but none compare with the ride and the handling I get from my MDX. For the price you really get almost more than you can ever ask for. Fully loaded with options, some I didn't even know I wanted, its a great ride around town, out on a twisty back road, or cruising down the interstate. The sound system is exceptional. And the DVD keeps my son very happy with movies and games. And on cold winter days, my back seat passengers loved the heated seats. Navigation and bluetooth are great, especially with the voice activation. The SH-AWD makes me feel secure in any kind of driving environment. Just want to drive fast and push it to the limit!"
acura,mdx,2008,Judith Temple, 03/31/2009,Best SUV Bang for your buck!,pos,"After having owned the BMW X3, the MDX is a pleasure to drive.  Reliability is great for 25,000 miles. Only things wrong are Bluetooth; rings and cannot hear whose on the other end and many viable addresses do not show up on Navigation system. Dealer service excellent.  A few miss-steps in design; no lights for A/C controls at night; rear view pic doesn't come on in reverse for 10 seconds, some wind noise, transmission can be rough and erratic.  No ipod plug which I didn't realize until after I purchased. Front end design could be improved, very masculine. Sounds like a lot but I do really like this car.  Also test drove BMW X5 and Lexus 400."
acura,mdx,2008,Eric Dise, 05/02/2009,Excellent Replacement,pos,"I owned a 2004 MDX Touring and traded for the new edition. I am very satisfied with my decision. The pep this has over my old MDX is undeniable. The comfort is much improved too. This 2008 is equipped exactly as my 2004 was but thanks to the poor economy, I paid nearly $3K less than the 04 as a model closeout! The MDX is fun to drive and nearly feels like a car. (Nearly...) I am very pleased with the decision to purchase this vehicle and look to have it for many years!"
acura,mdx,2008,Former Cayenne Owner, 01/03/2008,Great sport SUV,pos,"Traded a Cayenne and could not be happier.  The 300 HP provides great power, especially when downshifted.  Base model has all any true driver would need.  Really, how often does anyone need to use a GPS or call a restaurant while on the road or, for that matter, not know what is behind their vehicle.  This is a vehicle which can complete with the top SUVs on the market and retain its value.  Third seat is not for adults.  SH-AWD is  truly for those who want to ""push"" the vehicle while maintaining control in all conditions.  I have found the seating position for the driver to be very comfortable.  Sound system with the subwoffer can blow your teenager out of the vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,paulv, 01/09/2008,Must Have,pos,I have had the car for a month now. I must admit this is more of a great crossover SUV than I expected. The base model has all the things you need for your life. I got 17.4 miles per gallon in city drive. Not bad at all.
acura,mdx,2008,jb, 01/14/2008,exhilarating,pos,fun to drive! great looks! high tech features! ample horsepower compared to its direct competitors with the same engine displacement! better fuel consumption for its horsepower!
acura,mdx,2008,bob, 01/20/2008,Best vehicle ever!,pos,"I traded in a Lexus for this car.  It is way better than the Lexus.  It handles better, is more comfortable, looks better, and gets much better fuel economy.  And the overall quality is the best I've seen in some cars.  Overall, I can say that this is a great car that everyone should buy."
acura,mdx,2008,oscarkat3, 01/23/2008,Great Vehicle,pos,"This is a great all around vehicle. It is roomy but nimble.  The ride and handling combo are refined and strike a perfect balance.  There are no tippy sensations driving this car.   The seat comfort and driving position are perfect, just absolutely perfect. People of very different sizes can all find enough room and the right position.  The memory settings are fantastic for multi driver households.  The cargo room is good."
acura,mdx,2008,Richpat95, 06/14/2009,Handles like a dream,pos,Nothing on the road can compare to this vehicle.  I have driven every one and this is the crossover.  Handles like a dream and technology is so seamless and easy to use.  Sound system is simply remarkable.
acura,mdx,2008,JnJ, 07/08/2009,Great Car-like SUV... still miss my car,neu,"My experience with the Acura MDX 2008 has been nice. I came from driving a 2005 Nissan Max and needed something bigger and better with safety for me at the time (10 mth old son). The MDX does get up and go, but not initially. I have had it less than a year with just 11,000 hwy miles on it and have never had a problem until now. Took a trip to NC and came back with a loud humming noise. Turned out it was bad wheel bearings. Hopefully once fixed, will not happen again. Other than that all has been well and I am happy with the customer service I have received."
acura,mdx,2008,john, 08/27/2009,Very nice rig,pos,"I now have over 30k miles and have had a good experience with this SUV. I've had a Lexus GX, ML 500 and this vehicle compares very well. Not as powerful but gets the job done very well. It handles awesome and once the rpm's are up there it rips. A bit anemic off idle though. I tow a snowmobile trailer and the dealer tells me I need new shocks which are covered under warranty thankfully. I'd recommend this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,Buck, 11/12/2009,Love my MDX!,pos,"Best car I have ever driven.  I came from a mini van and wanted something more sporty.  Handling is great.  Easy to parallel park.  Turns on a dime.  I love how it looks.  Few things they should improve on: paint chips easily, bluetooth poor quality, navigation system needs much more updates, coin tray cover broke, running board separated, needs a right arm rest or higher console, a lot of wind noise unless you remove the roof rack, need a place to put my purse. When getting in the car I wish the seat would not advance right away; this makes it hard to get in. Had roaring noise in drivers front.  We already had to replace the bearings!!  Even with all this I still love the car."
acura,mdx,2008,Norcal221, 11/15/2009,20K Miles - Little Flaws,pos,"After 20K miles and 24 mos of owning the base model, still a blast to drive on dry, wet or snowy roads. SH-AWD outperforms my 4wd 08 Tahoe. Had electrical glitches that the dealer had to fix: CD player failed, exterior temp. thermometer failed, sunroof failed. 2nd stage clearcoat not premium-needs to be detailed every 6 mos or so to restore the like-new luster. Forget the 3rd row seating unless you have little kids; no legroom. 2nd row fits 3 adults comfortably. No other problems! Currently averaging 18 mpg & tires starting to fade due to aggressive driving. Worth every penny!"
acura,mdx,2008,Satisfied, 11/19/2009,Loved it...,pos,"3 yr lease just expired...I'd buy again.  I absolutely loved this car.   I prefer Honda or Toyota, Acura is my favorite.  By the time I had equipped comparable vehicles (BMW, Lexus, actually), there was no comparison in price.  Don't get me wrong, BMW and Lexus were fantastic, but about $8K more when comparably equipped.   Leasing fit me...I drive 12,000/yr.  Gas mileage was just as advertised...sometimes a mile or two better.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was the giant shield design on the front...which is now apparently on all Acura vehicles."
acura,mdx,2008,Rich, 04/12/2010,Very Good Mid Size SUV,pos,"Just turned 40,000 miles and still love my vehicle except for poor gas mileage and weak exterior paint that nicks/chips easily. Car rides very smoothly with lots of passing power. Quality and Reliability up to my current mileage have been excellent.  "
acura,mdx,2008,Tony V., 02/04/2008,I bought another one,pos,Had an '06 MDX Touring that was totalled by a drunk driver. Looked around for something different but always came back to the MDX. Bought Sport model with navi and ent. Love it so far. Runs great (400 miles into it). Many compliments on style and looks. Very happy with purchase.
acura,mdx,2008,E-Bohm, 02/11/2008,AWESOME,pos,"Fantastic drive, makes my 130 mile daily commute both fun and comfortable. "
acura,mdx,2008,Rhubbard, 02/14/2008,Who could ask for anything more?,pos,"Acura hit the nail on the head with the 08 MDX. The ride is smooth, the engine is powerful, and the features are top notch. To get a comparable vehicle (BMW X5, Audi, Lexus), the price skyrockets. Acura bundles it all together without compromising on quality."
acura,mdx,2008,wen, 02/16/2008,Poor build quality,neu,"Bought this car two months ago, sport model with ent-package and other bells and whistles. Supposed to enjoy this luxury vehicle, but having nothing but troubles. Been back to the dealer repair shop multiple times to repair multiple defects. Distorted mirror, defect gas door, leather peeling off the steering wheel and roof molding loosening. Last weekend, the roof rack cap flew away while driving the car on highway. It is very poor detail work on this car. It will be seventh trip to fix gas door and roof rack next next week."
acura,mdx,2008,wingshooter, 02/16/2008,Best value in a midsize luxury SUV,pos,"Replaced a 2006 Murano with this vehicle and could not be happier with my choice. Test drove the ML350, X5, Lexus GX470, and XC90. The MDX beats them all for THOUSANDS less. The SH-AWD is a technological wonder.  Handling is agile and the ride soaks up the bumps well. With 300hp on tap, it move when you want it to.  This is my first Honda product and I'm really impressed with the fit and finish and build quality Seats are very comfy.  All said this SUV has as much Sport as it does Utility, wrapped in Honda reliability."
acura,mdx,2008,Bigbelt, 02/26/2008,You get what you pay for,pos,"This car is like driving a sports car in an SUV.  We were downsizing from a Chevy Avalanche, and this was a great find.  The fuel economy is the only real drawback that we can say at this point in time about the vehicle.  You really should test drive this vehicle if you are considering anything in this class.  Much more responsive than the Lexus and a lot more room.  Looks like Acura did a great job of redesigning the whole vehicle.  This is a true pleasure to be behind the wheel.  Acceleration is very smooth, shifting is as well.  Braking and handling is next to none."
acura,mdx,2008,SanAntonioSweety, 03/01/2008,I LOVE MY '08 MDX!,pos,"My truck is great & I play hard, it seems as though it's built to last! Just came back from a trip to D.C. made it to D.C. in 28 hours from San Antonio! Took the scenic route thru ATL on the way home & made a few other stops. The MDX provided entertainment for my son via dvd & the nav was on point for me! Would have been lost up a creek w/o that!"
acura,mdx,2008,RV, 10/08/2007,Satisfied,pos,"Hello, Have had this car for three weeks, bought the tech/entertainment package (blk/blk). Car is beautiful inside and out. Navigation is easy to use, if you've had navigation before.  HandsFree Link with our blue tooth phones is awesome.  Car accelerates and handles excellently.  We own an integra before this so we knew it was going to be a quality vehicle and are not disappointed.  10 speaker stereo is amazing. Kids can listen/watch DVDs in back while we listen to radio in front.  Can't complaining about gas mileage, car is full sized SUV not a Honda civic!! Our MDX gets same gas mileage as our Pathfinder, if you want excellent gas mileage buy something smaller. Awesome car!!"
acura,mdx,2008,fort99, 10/01/2007,Excellent SUV,pos,We bought ours a week ago. So far so good. Excellent handling especially compared to 4Runner. It would be perfect with less tire noise. 
acura,mdx,2008,V V, 10/02/2007,2008 MDX-Tech,pos,"I just bought this about a month now. Driving is so fun, comfortable, easy to use the navigation. At night the interior looks just like a cockpit (I heard this word from my friends who saw my SUV). Most of the essential features are standard, so there are no additional expenses for a luxury SUV. The handling of this SUV is very nice, any sharp turn, neither passinger nor driver feels much body sway as like other car or SUVs. I rate this SUV 8-9/10 for most of the features."
acura,mdx,2008,Lee, 10/30/2007,Great Value,pos,I have always driven BMWs and the last car was the GX 470 Lexus.  The new 2008 Acura is an excellent value for the money.  It is about 12K less than the X5 for the same amenities.  Very happy with the purchase.  I have not had it serviced yet so cannot give an opinion on that yet.
acura,mdx,2008,Mr. Wang, 10/31/2007,Acura is Awesome!,pos,"I just purchased my new 2008 Acura MDX Sport and I love it. My trade was a 2004 Acura TL. The MDX is very quick, has great handling, smooth ride, and the fit and finish is excellent. The interior design is very intuitive and the navigation system is easy to use. There is plenty of passenger and storage room. I love the exterior design. Must have accessories are the sport running boards, side body molding, roof rails/cross bars, and the front and rear silver garnish. This is definitely a high performance SUV with lots of luxury!"
acura,mdx,2008,Tchello, 11/13/2007,Outstanding SUV !,pos,"After thorough research that included major brands (BMW, MB, Volvo & Audi) the MDX came on top. The standard model comes with leather, moonroof and 3rd row seat. Got the Sport package with technology and it's a bargain compared with the other, more fancy, brands. At least $10K less for a very similar, and in many cases, superior product. If you don't need the status of a BMW or Mercedes, this is the way to go. I traded my Audi A4, and I'm very happy I did so. Overall, very solid and handles great. Smooth."
acura,mdx,2008,gaawb, 11/18/2007,Outstanding vehicle,pos,"For the money, this is the finest vehicle on the road.  The nav system is unequaled and incredibly impressive.  I test drove the X5, FX45, MKX, Q7, and Enclave. It was a tough decision between the X5 and MDX but I will never look back. I've driven 2000 miles and it is an absolute pleasure in every way.  The 300hp engine actually puts a smile on my face when I punch it.  If you are looking for a crossover, this is a no-brainer."
acura,mdx,2008,Ali Samara, 11/29/2007,Awesome,pos,"This is a great car. I've had it for about three weeks and it is just so fun to drive.  I added the 19"" chrome wheels and it just looks great.  The 300 hp engine is powerful and the nav system is the best on the market. Don't know how I ever lived without it.  Best cross over suv on the market."
acura,mdx,2008,Mike, 11/19/2007,Great Car!,pos,"I just purchased a new 2008 Acura MDX.  We have 2 kids and were looking for an SUV with a 3rd row of seats.  Test drove the X5, Buick Enclave and Mazda, Lexus, Volvo and Chevy. This car was by far more superior for the room, price and comfort."
acura,mdx,2008,BobinSFCA, 03/05/2008,Well Built at a Bargain Price,pos,"This vehicle replaced a 2005 Honda Pilot EXL.  I had such good luck with my other Hondas I decided to stay with the brand. The price of the MDX compared to what it offers is a ""no brainer.""  It drives like a combination of my old Pilot and an S2000 I use to have. I often forget it is an SUV. The build quality is spectacular; first new car I have had that has no rattles or defects. "
acura,mdx,2008,seamas, 03/08/2008,Performance with Style,pos,The experience in driving the MDX is in a category altogether different to any other SUV I have driven. The handling is superb and when coupled with the comfort and styling of the interior makes it an exhilarating and luxurious experience which was unexpected.  
acura,mdx,2008,leennp, 12/03/2007,Love this vehicle,pos,"Purchased this vehicle to replace Suburban and its string of problems and have been nothing but pleased with the MDX.  Even like the nav system which I only got so I could get the DVD and rear lift gate.  Highly recommend this vehicle, gas mileage has been better than stated."
acura,mdx,2008,Big Fan!, 03/30/2008,Wouldn't want anything else,pos,"Previously owned (and loved) an '01 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Looked at another JGC and found out that mine was superior to the current JGCs.  I shopped BMW, Infiniti, Lexjus, BMW X5.  MDX is easiest and most comfortable car or SUV I have ever owned, very quiet and smooth.  Navi took practice, but now is easy to operate.  I won't own another car that doesn't have it.  AWD is like you're on rails.  Stereo is second to none & iPod adapter is simple.  I don't use XM or real-time traffic, but I would b/c they were great during the free trial period."
acura,mdx,2008,Better than the lex, 04/10/2008,Very Pleased,pos,"Coming from an 05 Lexus RX, this is a significant improvement.  The MDX feels solid on the road.  Handles firm but comfortable on the highway.  Havent had a chance to check it out in the snow but looking forward to it.  Gas mileage could be better but its got 300 horses, cant have everything.  Nav system is a big plus.  Easy to use and comes with bluetooth and a very good sound system in the package.  "
acura,mdx,2008,tammyd, 04/13/2008,Love this car!,pos,"I love this car.  I owned an MDX before purchasing the 2008 with the new body style and roomier interior.  I opted for the loaded version.  I think the joystick navigation is wonderful and so much easier to use.  I also love the new body style.  The inside is roomier than the older version.  With trying to stay in the midsize SUV and having a 3rd row seat, this can't be beat.  The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row.  Also, with the position of the handles now being in the middle instead of the top of the seats, it is much easier to pull the seats up when using the 3rd row.  One simple tug and ""presto"" - extra seating.  Great buy!  You'll love it!"
acura,mdx,2008,v10Acura, 04/15/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"The only other car I was considering with it were the X5 and ML. The handling of SH-AWD simply blew us away. In my opinion it had significatnly less body roll then even the others. The ride is very confidence-inspiring in rain, sun and snow. The sound system is absolutely incredible. Furthermore, I for one also really like the knob instead of touchscreen navigation. I find that the engine power is good from a standstill, but could use more power for passing. Certain speeds dont allow you to shift down to reach high revs required for optimal torque. As such sometimes you dont get sufficient acceleration. i also really like the styling. "
acura,mdx,2008,rt, 04/21/2008,Luv my '08 MDX,pos,"Replaced a Honda CRV with this but not before test driving the Mercedes ML350 and ML320, BMW X3 and X5 and the Lexus RX. This vehicle was by far smoother, more comfortable, more powerful and somehow more economical! "
acura,mdx,2008,Mike, 04/23/2008,Great SUV,pos,"This is my first SUV and I couldn't be happier.  Choice was between an 08 Highlander and 08 MDX and for a few thousand more you get a much more impressive interior, better handling & steering feedback, a more agile ride, and HID headlamps.  Fuel economy has been much more impressive than expected - ~24 highway, ~19 city, 22 avg with 65/35 highway/city driving (1,300 mi on odo).  Only major gripes are you can't read the stereo display screen with sun glare from sunroof (even on max brightness) & no compass is present."
acura,mdx,2008,Lexy, 04/26/2008,Good Value,pos,Dealer painted the silver shield on grille the car color giving a sharper look. Traded a 2003 MDX which was a great vehicle. The new car longer wheelbase and more weight gives a smooth ride. Chose the MDX over the Lexus RX. Bigger inside and out with later technology.
acura,mdx,2008,shaba, 04/29/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"Love this vehicle. I was actually considering the Buick Enclave before I test drove the MDX. The MDX feels much more solid, has smooth acceleration, lots of power, corners great!! You feel much more stable in the MDX than the other vehicles in this class. The interior is classy ! You really feel safe in this cage!!"
acura,mdx,2008,Albert, 05/03/2008,Right Choice,pos,"Test drove Lexus RX 350, Volvo XC90, Pilot, and 2009 Murano before selecting the MDX. It's the best in class.  Great SUV. It runs much better after the initial 500 miles or so. GPM got better too.  Some of the accessories should have been made standard (roof rail, side molding). The plastic door handle and the same color plastic on the steering wheel make the interior look cheap. Acura should have made them better and add a few hundred dollars to the based. This is sold by Honda/Acura as a luxury SUV. "
acura,mdx,2008,Ryki, 05/01/2008,My 3rd MDX,pos,"This is my 3rd MDX, I have had a 2001, a 2005 and now a 2008. This is the Best Bang for the Buck SUV on the road. Looks great inside and out. Good performance, good handling, decent feul economy (16 mpg on mixed driving) for a 300 horsepower engine and all these vehicles have proved very reliable.   "
acura,mdx,2008,CLEW, 05/05/2008,Acura MDX = Amazing Sport SUV,pos,"We just purchased an 08 MDX with Tech and Entertainment with the power rear door.  I drove X5 (3.0 and 4.8), Caddy SRX, and Mazda CX9 and hands down the Acura was the choice to make.  It handles like (or better really) than the BMW with so many more options for the price.  If you want a great, luxury SUV and want the best quality and value go with the MDX.  The handling is so impressive, and the power from the 3.7 litre V6 will shock you.  Navi is so easy to use and the whole sound system is unreal!"
acura,mdx,2008,Billboy, 05/07/2008,Excellent value by comparison,pos,"We traded our 2005 BMW X5 for this 2008 Acura MDX.  The BMW was good, but the Acura is surprisingly better in many ways.  Actually handles better, has a quieter ride and more power than the BMW.  The interior is well-designed and matches up with our previous best in class, an Audi we owned a few years ago.  The cost of ownership will be only slightly higher ($39 for an oil change where the BMW was covered while under warranty), but the eventual cost should be lower.  The styling is what really caught my eye.  More muscular stance and presence, but more interior space."
acura,mdx,2008,gtfranklin, 05/08/2008,Can't believe it's 4600 lbs.,pos,"My previous 4 cars were 3 BMWs and a G35, and I finally found a crossover that didn't disappoint in the handling dept. This is actually fun to drive! My G35 and previous M3 were quicker, but didn't handle significantly better in most driving situations. Solid, comfortable, tons of space, and WAY less expensive that comp. X-5, Audi, etc. Mileage 19.4 in 1st 2000 miles."
acura,mdx,2008,Bradley, 05/13/2008,Outstanding Value,pos,"I researched and test drove everything else in this style of vehicle (Acadia, Buick, Nissan, Mazda, Honda).  For the money, this is the best by far.  The ride is excellent, the nav is great and the graphics are much better than GM.  I love the cockpit feel of the cabin and the comfort of the seating.  The exterior got my attention and the interior keeps it.  I have three children ages 10, 8 and 8 and we are in a carpool with two other kids for a total of 6 people in the vehicle.  We can easily fit one more.  We have 16.6 MPG with mixed driving (mostly driving in the local neighborhoods).  Got over 23 MPG when on the highway for a short period of time.  We look for reasons to drive places!"
acura,mdx,2008,Bert Viloria, 05/12/2008,Great SUV,pos,"I just bought my 2008 MDX a couple of weeks ago and I have been thoroughly impressed with its superb handling, amazing interior with all its electronic gadgetry, and beautiful exterior, which has not always pleased everyone.  The ride is smooth, aggressive, but not dull and lifeless.  The standard electronics available, even for my basic MDX is a long list and should easily please everyone!"
acura,mdx,2008,rndymn16, 05/17/2008,It's just okay,pos,"MDX rides nice but everything inside is basically ""cheap"". Voice recognition is not quite there. Also surprised that it's the only SUV that didn't come standard with roof rails."
acura,mdx,2008,richard mcmullen, 05/28/2008,Disappointed,neu,"I have owned 3 Hondas and 2 Acuras before. I had an 05 MDX and a 02 TL-S. I am very disappointed in the rigid ride of this vehicle. I have the base model. My 05 was softer and a more comfortable ride. I feel every bump in the road. I am suprised that Acura would not leave the base model as a more comfortable ride and give the stiffer ride to the sport package. There is a soft thump thump when I first start the car and reach 20 mph. I don't know if it is transmission, engine or suspension knock. There is a rattle on the pass door somewhere. The shifter is on the left of the center console and gets in the way of my right knee/leg. Info center is too small and in wrong place. No compass."
acura,mdx,2008,martin Harris, 12/17/2016,Drives itself,pos,"Only weakness large blind spots sold 2016.

acura,mdx,2008,SpecL Ed, 01/21/2020,Still going strong,pos,"Bought mine in 2009 w 18K miles.  Just turned 100K. Interior and exterior still look like new. Runs perfect. Still pulls strong 19MPG in city 25 highway. I'd like something newer but hard pressed to give it up.

acura,mdx,2008,Lorraine, 07/19/2020,MDX met da expectations!,pos,"Great car. Quiet, smooth ride
"
acura,mdx,2009,Aaron, 09/27/2016,The Golden Retriever of Luxury SUV's,pos,"This is our first ACURA after previously coming from a Honda Odyssey.  The Reliability has been very good. No Major failures, and never left us on the road. Only one repair done under warranty, a right front wheel bearing.  All else has been standard service work.  Not the cheapest to maintain but not BMW outrageous either.   Gas mileage has been below expected at just about 16.5mpg for mostly city use, but the handling and power make it kinda hard not to goose it a bit! Speaking of handling, the SH-AWD is awesome, you can tell when the torque vectoring is taking place, but it's not obtrusive, in fact it's kinda of addicting to engage it.  Fun, fun, fun to drive especially on any winding road.  Plenty of interior room for our family of 4 and large dog for multiple 1000 mile + trips.  Overall excellent ownership experience and most likely will be a repeat MDX buyer.
"
acura,mdx,2009,brod77381, 05/28/2010,Favorite vehicle I've ever had!,pos,I love my MDX - it's my most favorite vehicle I've ever had!  I bought a pre-owned 2009 MDX w/Technology package in black with black interior.  I knew I wanted an SUV mid-size and looked at several.  The MDX gives you the most bang for your buck.
acura,mdx,2009,Gerald Kershner, 04/05/2016,You won't be disappointed! Great handling SUV!,pos,"Best SUV I've ever driven and owned. Take a test drive and see for yourself. Bought it used with noisy directional tread tires, replaced them with Acura OEM tires ... wow, what a difference.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Jessie P, 07/03/2009,Huge mistake!,neu,"Generally I buy cars based on my trust in a company. I've owned a total of 6 Honda products (including Acura - TL), and all of them have been outstanding. This vehicle is a big disappointment!!! Where do I begin? I buy Honda products (and Japanese vehicles in general) for their bulletproof reliability, but I've had numerous problems with this MDX - been to dealer 6 times! Electrical issues, and a Transmission issue, and some others....and the power/acceleration is very mediocre (300hp?? Yeah, right!), and the ENGINE is VERY NOISY and unrefined when accelerating!!! Shocking for a luxury vehicle. Terrible leather! Sound system, Nav and handling are the only good attributes of this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2009,Carl R, 11/16/2009,Great SUV,pos,"I just came out of an Audi A-8 yet needed a SUV.  I normally would not even consider a MDX however my wife bought an Acura RL in April and loved the car; the quality and ride was excellent so I elected to look at the MDX.  The ride is excellent and the finish is terrific. I felt the interior was nicer than the Q7.  The sound system in the vehicle (with the Tech package) is exceptional and better then in my previous Audi, Jaguar and Lexus. I love driving it!"
acura,mdx,2009,Shandu, 08/23/2015,"235,000 miles",neu,"There is a common electrical issue.  From the first 3000 miles there was a short in the radio meaning, when it get hot the sound would skip like a turn table skipping.  The XM radio, CD player, AM/FM and DVD player sound would skip.  Took it to several dealership from Long Island, Manhattan, and Westchester Acura.  No one could find the reason, each saying to return the car at the time that the sound is skipping.  Replace the first battery within one year.  Twice the battery was dead within six months.  Second time, dealer replace under warranty.  Third time, the discharge of the battery even though the vehicle was off cause my a/c compressor to blow.  The dealer said that the unit was drawing power even though it was off.  The pressure build to the point where it cause the unit to blow.  Dealer replace the battery and the A/C relay.  Also the constant drain on the battery which maybe linked to the HLF/blue tooth system.  I had to disconnect the HLF/blue took system.  Gas mileage is very weak.  Average about  15 miles per gallon on high way, due to heavy foot.  Keep in mind I travel at least 160 miles per day.  Yes, gas prices are high but I love my MDX.  It corners like a dream at 65-70 mph on a curvy two lane country road.   I am 6'1"" and sit very well In my captain seat.  The second row is hard to move forward for rear entry into the third row.  Michelin Tires are the best so far in terms of gas saving and road noise.  Have changed the following, tire road, oil plan, a/c relay switch, 3 battery on my fourth.   Wanted to be the owner who reaches over 500,000 miles but it will be expensive.
"
acura,mdx,2009,mend, 03/18/2009,Disappointed,neu,Vehicle is daily driver for my wife and she seems to like the car but this is the roughest riding vehicle I have ever driven. All small bumps and holes in the road are felt in the steering and suspension. Make sure that you drive the vehicle on a long test drive on all conditions of pavement as this was the mistake that I made. Have tried running the vehicle with the bare min. air pressure in the tires but not much helps. Hopefully the suspension will loosen up with time as I try not to ride in or drive this car which is quite a let down.
acura,mdx,2009,Enjay, 12/11/2009,Timing belt issues with a 2009 MDX,neu,"My 2009 MDX with 3500+ miles has been taken to dealer 3 times in the last month. Once I had to get it towed to dealership. First time I was told that they was issue with poor quality Timing belt pulley. So timing belt got shredded. They had to replace them both. They took almost week to replace it. Within a day, 2009 MDX developed issue. This time there was an issue with Catalytic converter. They took another week to replace. Again within two days, ""Check emission system"" came up again. This time I was told they would have to replace another catalytic converter and also sub converters. This is putting a big question mark on Acura products. Quality?"
acura,mdx,2009,Stanley Eilers, 02/27/2015,Worst SUV/auto I have owned,neg,"My experience with a 2009 ACURA MDX with 71,000 miles driven
1.  AC Unit had to be replaced
2.  Struts had to be replaced
3.  AC Control module had to be replaced (illumination led lights on control board did not work)
4.  Control module overhead had to be replaced (illumination lights on control board did not work)
5.  Front wheel bearings had to be replaced
My best advice to anyone buying an ACURA MDX is to buy their platinum extended warranty.  If you have the experiences I have had with this vehicle it will set you back a pretty penny.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Sid Keeny, 06/25/2019,Work horse,pos,"Buy a used one so you don't take the huge hit from massive depreciation.  Does almost everything very well. No car does everything perfect but this one is on par with my Toyota Highlander. I had to move up one big notch so I could tow a boat. My High Lander towed the boat but I feared it was just abusive to continue. The MDX has proven to be reliable and does everything we asked of it. Parts and repairs can be a bit high but the quality is obviously there. I joke and tell people I had to pay 15K just to have one comfortable chair in my life. The acceleration of this SUV is amazing. When you put the petal to the floor it just flies and I have had it well over 100MPH and it never got scary.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Sri, 11/26/2009,Questionable reliability,neu,2009 MDX with less than 4000 miles developed an issue with timing belt and timing belt pulleys. Got it towed to dealer. Dealer told us the front part of engine also got damaged. So they are trying to repair. Filed a complaint with Acura.So far as there was no action from their side as well. I did not pay 46K to get such trouble prone vehicle. People buy acura vehicles because their reliability. It looks like Reliability is getting questionable now.  
acura,mdx,2009,Kristina W., 10/17/2018,Great SUV but some tech issues!!,pos,"Had this suv almost 3 months now. Bought it used with 113,000 miles on it. Luv the car but now seems to be having some technical issues. When driving it sounds like someone is hitting the unlock button for the doors. Got in it this morning and my windows wouldn’t roll down and the sunroof wouldn’t work. After a few mins everything started working again, but same problem when I got back in the car after stopping. Overall a great car for myself having 4 girls.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Jane, 03/10/2019,Best car I've ever owned,pos,"We bought our 2009 MDX base model new and I have enjoyed driving it for the last 9 years! We take it in for regular maintenance, replace the tires when they need to be replaced and generally take good care of it. We have roughly 122,000 miles on it and it's still going strong. We plan to let my daughter drive it once she has her license and we feel great about it's safety on the road. We live in Maine and have lots of snow and ice-- the car handles well in difficult conditions  the standard all weather tires work beautifully. I may well buy another one when I hand over the keys to this one-- or transition to the RDX since I don't have to drive as many kids around anymore! Love this car! Great family vehicle! Very comfortable front seats (I have a back condition and this is very important to me).
"
acura,mdx,2009,acurahappy, 04/08/2010,The Ususal Well Built Honda,pos,"Have owned two Honda's before the MSX, and have been happy with the reliability of both vehicles. Was looking for another SUV, but more upscale from my 94 explorer. All the other stuff out there didn't appeal to me or was too expensive. Since I have had the mdx (sept. 09) I am completely happy with my purchase. The ride is very comfortable and quiet. Has been a pleasure to drive in the city, long trips and in the mountains. The all wheel drive system makes it handle very well on turns of windy roads. My mileage in the city has averaged 18-19 mpg, and up to 25 on the hwy. Impressive for a 300 hp motor. I like the style. Don't mind the ""beak"" in front. It gives it its character. A lot of car for the money.  "
acura,mdx,2009,fishin8tor, 12/01/2009,New and nice,pos,"Only had the car for two weeks, but really like all the features, especially the way this car customizes everything from the drivers seat, ac, and keyless memory system.  Steering is accurate and direct on center, but took some time to get used to as used to drive a Odyssey.  Power is soft at first, but comes on strong when you push it.  Love the transmission and shifter as it is quick on the shifts and doesn't hesitate like other systems.  The SH-AWD is kinda neat, and haven't used it but once in a turn, but it's nice to have and gives great confidence when driving.  Mileage on is 20 on trip to bay area, and city seems around 16.  So far, so good!  I am looking forward to years of driving."
acura,mdx,2009,Myron Yorks, 01/05/2010,What a machine,pos,The MDX is truely a SUV with excellent handling and is fun to drive. I've had the MDX for one month and yet to find anything that requires me to go back to the dealer for. The craftsmanship is something else. I would highly recommend the MDX. I have no regrets with my purchase. My wife and I have driven our new MDX to the coast twice over the past month and it handles so good thru all the twist and turns on highway 1. What a awesome ride. Yet it is still a family SUV. The MDX is the complete package.

acura,mdx,2009,Papa Leo, 10/02/2010,Not what I expected from Acura,neg,"13 months into ownership and I have nothing but a trouble with that car. One week into ownership, Air Bag warning came up. It was found that side B-pillar air bag was lose. Another 2 month, car started to pull to the side badly (car had only 3K miles on it), it was found to be misaligned. Another 2 month, gas door wouldn't keep close (replaced under warranty). Another 6 months into ownership and drive side window wouldn't open (window motor bad). My previous '03 Mitsubishi Montero didn't see repair shop for 6 years I owned it (55K miles), only oil changes, tire replacement, and one new set of brakes before drunk driver plunged into me and totaled it. This is my first and the last Acura. "
acura,mdx,2009,Greg, 04/06/2017,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,neg,"This SUV looks good on the outside, that is about it. I purchased it in September with only 69k miles on it. like 3 months later, I am hearing a whirling noise coming from underneath the vehicle, while driving on the highway. At first, I was thinking it was a wheel bearing. Took it to my mechanic, he said it is not the wheel bearing, could be the Torque Converter. I was thinking perhaps, the propeller shaft and I still think it is the propeller shaft. The engine sounds horrible. My guess are the pulleys. Brand new, this vehicle is 40k, glad I didn't buy brand new. I will be going back to Toyota because Acura (Honda) is very disappointing."
acura,mdx,2009,MG, 10/27/2008,Not that empressive,neu,"All in all I expected much more in the power area and the sound system was a real let down and I have wind noise on driver side and the ride could be nicer I feel all the bumps one the road , right up into the steering wheel. But I have to admit it's beautiful looking. oh ya premium fuel so gas cost are terrible. It does not live up to the reviews it gets (my opinion)."
acura,mdx,2009,tastycakes, 11/30/2009,Best out there in its class [for now],pos,"Buying the MDX felt like an arranged marriage, not true love. For cargo storage, vehicle size, functionality, AWD and price compared to competitors, the MDX is great. But driving...well I don't know who said this is a fun drive.  5-spd tranny feels dated and sluggish to accelerate.  Feel disconnected from the road more so than other CUVs.  Lacks features like keyless entry/ignition, blind spot monitoring.  Leather seems cheap compared to all competitors.  Fuel economy disappointing at 14 mpg (80% highway) after 3 tanks. Lacks small touches in design - example is doors feel light and flimsy when closed.  Chose MDX over CX-9 for the badge but have been feeling regret since purchase."
acura,mdx,2009,Yoshodeep, 02/14/2010,"Overall, a great vehicle",neu,"Having driven the car around town as well as some long trips, I am satisfied with the vehicle. 3rd row seating works fine, albeit not for tall people by any means. Nice pick up. More spacious than I thought from the outside. SH-AWD works great in slick snowy condition. I bought the base pkg, and the sound quality is plenty good. Leather seats are not at par with BMW standards. Bluetooth is somewhat cumbersome (voice recognition only). Can't say enough about the leg and shoulder rooms enough. It is fun to drive, from the SUV perspective. At this price, expected scheduled free maintenance though. Overall one of the best buys in the segment."
acura,mdx,2009,usaheadhunter, 12/20/2009,Acura 2009 MDX Sport AWD,pos,"Purchased after looking at all the rest; BMW, Mercedes, Enclave, Audi, Toyota. Sport package took me over the edge to buy. Handling is fantastic. Seating excellent. Controls easy to use. Cost to own seems relatively strong in Edmunds. We will have to wait and see. After two years, this automobile should have 6 speed transmission. Looks like 2010 will finally have one. When I found out it had build parts in Canada, wanted to turn it back in to the dealer!   "
acura,mdx,2009,Terry Gonsalves, 10/16/2010,Worst I have qwned,neu,Thud/scraping noise from front wheel when driving from cold.Driver side window rattle. Dealer says that these are the characteristics of the vehicle. Acura Canada not responsive.Why is it only a characteristic after you buy the vehicle. Very poor fuel economy. Worst vehicle I have owned. Definitely a do not buy.  
acura,mdx,2009,davidb, 10/23/2008,Buyer's Remorse,neg,"I've bought at least 10 cars over my life and always been 100% satisfied.  For the first time I feel I made a huge mistake.  I've got 1500 miles on a new MDX and I've decided to get rid of the damned thing.  Engine noise reminds me of a 4 cylinder Camry, the transmission is jerky, particularly when downshifting - take your foot off the gas at 60 and the engine immediately starts dragging you down, almost like no overdrive.  The front seats are exhausting if you sit in them over an hour.  And the steering is way too stiff and the indentations on the wheel are spaced too far apart.  I took at least 4 or 5 test drives and for the life of me I don't know how I missed these details."
acura,mdx,2009,Kim, 11/12/2009,JUNKWAGON!,neg,"Well, two transmissions in the first year of ownership should tell you something.  Gas mileage is terrible.  Never got more than 15mpg.  Rattles like it has 100k miles on it.  Dealer stinks and is not very knowledgeable.  First and last Honda product."
acura,mdx,2009,richard, 01/29/2017,Worst car ever purchased!,neg,"We were so disappointed ...... trim pieces broke, sunroof leaked and fried relay circuits, handles for seats broke, leather on drivers seat ripped, and many more.  Certainly others have had these problems because we are gentle folks and maintain the car to a fault.  Where does Acura get these faulty trim pieces?  I forgot to mention rear suspension pieces broke at about 40000 and other front suspension problems.  Never again Acura (or Honda I guess).

Still the worst car ever!

acura,mdx,2009,Richie Rich, 08/29/2008,The MDX is simply the Best Crossover,pos,"Simply the best crossover on the road.  I drove the X5, the Mercedes, Infiniti FX and none could compare the right blend of comfort, fun, performance, handling.  Not sure how anyone could even compare the Mazda CX9 to this vehicle.  You can never go wrong with the MDX"
acura,mdx,2009,Ryki, 04/15/2009,Great Bang for the Buck,pos,"This is my 3rd MDX. Great vehicle, reliable, comfortable, quick and fun to drive. Dollar for dollar there is no better SUV on the market today. I have put about 100,000 miles on the 3 MDX's with few if any problems. My only real gripe is that the few problems I have had, have been dealt with poorly. The service departments of the Acura dealers are well below par, in fact they are poor. This is my 4th Acura in 7 years and as much as I love the vehicles, because of the quality of Acura's service, this will probably be my last. Honda get your act together you ain't no Lexus."
acura,mdx,2009,JSC3605, 03/07/2010,Update afetr 6500 miles,pos,"Love the SUV. Just got back from a trip to Pittsburgh. Got over 24 MPG on the highway. This machine is very quite, fast and has lots of room. Great SUV for the money...:)"
acura,mdx,2009,NHHawk6, 12/07/2008,Brilliant design and execution! A joy!,pos,"Test drove everything over a three month period.  Decided on the MDX because of its styling, handling, and technology.  Nothing else in the segment came close. Now that I own it, I enjoy this vehicle far more than I ever imagined possible.  I knew it was a great SUV, but the package in total, leaves you shaking your head at times. It is a precise vehicle, inside and out.  Fit and finish is exceptional.  Performance receives an A++ for a seven passenger vehicle, and it makes you want to drive the long way home everyday.  The luxury, entertainment, and technology features lead you to believe you are already ""home""!  I recommend the Acura MDX Sports and Entertainment edition w/out hesitation!"
acura,mdx,2009,CarNut, 12/06/2008,Best of the Best,pos,"The sales consultant showed me a competitive comparison of the MDX vs GX470, X5, XC90, etc.  It said the MDX was #1 and I didn't believe it so I went and drove all the competitors and I admit I was wrong.   The MDX is the best out there.  Perfect blend of luxury, power safety and reliability.  No buyers remorse here."
acura,mdx,2009,Sean, 12/16/2008,Great handling SUV,pos,"This is one of the best handling SUVs in the market in my opinion.  I test drove several other usual suspects (Lexus RX, BMW X5 etc), and MDX has a nice combination of power, handling, convenience / luxury features at a very competitive price.  When you think about the balance of power, handling, value, reliability, it is hard to beat this SUV.  In 2006, Car and Driver did a comparison test and MDX came out on top.  Also, if you are thinking about getting an MDX for the third row seat, note that the third row seat is best used for kids or smaller adults on a shorter trip as space is very limited.  "
acura,mdx,2009,kurtkbee, 01/04/2009,My 2009 MDX,pos,"I researched this car for over 1 year before purchasing. While I test drove the BMW X5 (3.0) and the Audi Q7 I  always came back to the MDX (Tech/ent). While the other SUVs offered some minor technologies not found in the MDX, those features would have satisfied less than 1% of my needs but when they were configured with all the features of the Tech/Ent MDX the competitors were $8k-$10k more.  The performance of the car is really great and even when taking a bend at a high speed it seemed to handle the road better than my coupe.  The exterior design is very nice and gives the SUV and aggressive look. My wife and I love the SUV but really miss the efficiency that we once had with a sedan"
acura,mdx,2009,gregs, 01/12/2009,Super fun to drive,pos,"- Mazda CX9 was initially my #1 choice - After test driving CX9, I was disappointed with the driving experience (the ride is very shaky) - I tried the MDX, and was blown away by how it handled in the first 5 mins. The experience was silky smooth, yet at the same time aggressive, assertive and very sporty. - The SH AWD is amazing. During the test drive, the dealer encourage me to take sharp highway on-ramps at 60 mpg - I could feel the outer wheels ""pushing"" the car away from the turn - the feeling was totally exhilarating - I kiteboard - the adrenaline rush from the SH AWD (when used aggressively) is comparable to what I feel when on water - I would have never imagined that to be possible"
acura,mdx,2009,JT, 02/02/2009,09 MDX Tech/Ent Review,pos,"Upon owning my MDX for 2 months now, I am in some areas very impressed and in some areas let down a little.  15/20 is the advertised fuel economy.  I have managed as much as 28 MPG cruising at 58 MPH on the interstate.  I have a combined average of 19.8 since new.  On a 2500 mile trip I got 23.0.  Very impressive.  Downs - black interior trim swirls and scratches like crazy.  Leather seating looks like it's been sat in for 10 years already.  It sags and has permanent indentions.  I use Meguiars Leather cleaner/conditioner and it makes them look clean and shiny, but leather still looks worn beyond actual life.  Car is strong as heck, does what I want it to, but seats and trim are questions.  "
acura,mdx,2009,msam, 02/16/2009,SH SUV,pos,"Even though I loved the features of the MDX, I was originally not planning on getting a premium SUV and my preference was the Mazda CX9.  I got to test drive both the vehicles in the snow on the same day.  I was blown away by the MDX handling in the snow.  Compared to the CX9, it was miles ahead.  I bought it the same day and have not looked back. I love the features that come standard with the MDX.  The SH-AWD system performs great in cornering and I don't have to worry about hitting patches of ice/water.  The MDX slows down a bit more than you would expect when removing your leg off the accelerator, which took me a bit getting used to. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
acura,mdx,2009,JAnn, 02/27/2009,"Nice, but has some flaws",pos,"I love driving my MDX. The base model has everything you really need, it includes a lot of upgrades that you pay for in other cars. The negatives: Low quality leather, it wears bad. The black plastic trim would be better replaced with wood trim, for a $40,000 vehicle that shouldn't even be a question. I notice a lot of road noise in the cabin. Also, I have the worst time getting my hands free link to recognize certain numbers. Sometimes I will have to say the number 4 like 5 times before it will actually dial the correct number. That is VERY frustrating. Also, for a $40,000 vehicle, it should have an automatic liftgate. This car does have excellent road handling, overall I am happy!"
acura,mdx,2009,AcuraMDX09, 03/11/2009,"Fun to drive, joy to own",pos,"I tried to convince myself to buy a German SUV. I test drove the X5 (3.0), Audi Q7, and the ML 350. In my opinion none of the German cars come close to touching the MDX in handling, comfort and space. Material could be a touch better in the MDX (the black fiberglass trim looks cheap for example). But there is no way I could justify 8-10K more for any of the German cars. And don't get me started on the RX350 or the CX9. "
acura,mdx,2009,rams, 04/20/2009,Transmission problem at 400 miles,neg,"Bought my MDX 4 months back. After 2 months transmission fluid started leaking, noticed oil marks on my garage floor. Took to dealer - they had to open the whole transmission and check inside. The problem was a faulty ""O"" ring which was causing the leak. If a $20 part is faulty after 400 miles not sure what to expect from this SUV. The dealer had to remove the whole transmission, unlink it with the engine, opened up everything connected to the engine to get to the faulty O ring. Don't buy this car, for this price there are much better options in the market. I have Lexus SUV as well and it far exceeds Acura from performance and reliability."
acura,mdx,2009,sunsky, 04/28/2009,Best car ever,pos,This is the best car ever. 
acura,mdx,2009,schooldoc, 04/29/2009,Better than expected gas mileage,pos,"I read these review before I buy so that's why I'm doing this. My first SUV, typically German sports cars. 11,000 miles no problems, gas mileage computer at 65 mph freeway 25-26 mpg, if I were to drive at 80 it would drop to 20-21, so I'm happy. Love sport suspension, in an emergency quick manuever suspension tightened up and I avoided an accident, fun too. Sequoia mtns. Snow was fun an safe handling, lots of power, remember im used to BMW's and Porsche's, no longer trust Mercedes. Surprised I enjoy the elec. Tail gate, love the taupe interior, nav screen big, blu tooth wonderful, computer info good, x-lights great cockpit comfort, luv the front grill etc. Looking to buy another in 2 years."
acura,mdx,2009,shooterj, 05/06/2009,Nice ride...,pos,"Switched from RX400H to MDX due to the need for more room to haul rugrats. :) Test drove X5, Fx35/50, and GX470, somehow overall MDX gave me the best combo scores in handling, performance, luxury amenities, and reliability... not to mention the safety rating on this 300 HP beast... "
acura,mdx,2009,amital, 05/08/2009,Disappointing,neu,"Save your money folks -lot better stuff out there for the price. Have owned new MDX for about a year.  Maintenance costs are VERY high. Differential fluid changes every 15,000 miles - not kidding. It's based on the service code.  Dealers are all old school and in terrible condition. Have been to 3 different ones and they're all unprofessional -- and crooks to boot!  Today I took the MDX in and apparently the brakes went out at 25000 miles. Fog/DTL light cover had melted from heat and they told me the exhaust from someone backing up real close must have done it -- unbelievable!  Acura cust svc is just as bad.  I have a Lexus too-the service experience and reliability is in a whole diff. league."
acura,mdx,2009,IN46321, 05/10/2009,Safe and solid performer,pos,"Love my MDX. Solid build quality and fit n finish. Did a apples to apples comparison with the Lexus RX 350. Hands down the MDX is much better value. The smoothness of the ride and the technology package is just incredible. My 2 kids(8 & 6) are having a ball. Bluetooth and phone book downloads are so convenient. The navigation system with lane assist, traffic updates and other advanced features like Zagat rocks! Xm is a nice icing on the cake..Can't stop looking at it and driving it. Plunge in and pamper yourself. You live only once.."
acura,mdx,2009,J. Isman, 06/01/2009,Great 3-row SUV,pos,"For comfort and luxury it can't be beaten....design is sharp, esp. front grill and badge....wish the city gas mileage were a bit better...not bad tho' on the highway..."
acura,mdx,2009,ljndsl , 06/02/2009,So Far So GOOD!,pos,"Picked up this vehicle one month ago and so far logged 3200 miles without any problems. The vehicle runs great and is very comfortable for a guy who is 6'5"" tall and 280lbs. I researched all AWD high end vehicles and went with the MDX. I had the car in for service at the dealership I purchased it and they were fantastic and extremely professional, so maybe Honda has listened and read all the consumer complaints. Last, I own a BMW X3 also... this SUV smokes the X3 in regards to service maintenance. A BMW oil change is 250.00 plus... a Acura oil change is 39.00 with a free car wash! "
acura,mdx,2009,Dave, 06/20/2009,Pretty good,neu,"Nice car. Build quality is excellent. Dealer service has been excellent. Bluetooth cell phone pairing is easy and nice.  Seats are hard for me to set up comfortably though and the headrests are absolutely awful. Very uncomfortable due b/c they tilt too far forward.  Dash has too many buttons. Acura should consolidate the controls to make them easier to use, rather than trying to make you depend on voice input. GPS requires far too many steps.   No iPod integration is disappointing. Needs better, more durable clear coat on the paint.  Rear camera display hangs switching modes (dark to light) backing out of a driveway so often is useless when needed most on a sunny day."
acura,mdx,2009,JW, 06/30/2009,Not too shabby!,pos,Owned it for only a few days and really enjoy driving it. Panel controls are complicated but not impossible. Will see about reliability later...
acura,mdx,2009,Ralph, 07/22/2009,"Nice SUV, Could Be Better",pos,"I am very impressed with the handling and many electronic features of the MDX, but I am somewhat disappointed in some of the interior fit & finish, harshness/loudness of the engine, audio quality, complexity of the navigation system, and the dealer add-ons that should be standard in a $40K+ vehicle."
acura,mdx,2009,Dmitriy, 07/24/2009,Solid SUV,pos,"This is a very well-built SUV. Great interior, audio, engine, transmission. Exterior design will be updated, no doubt. Fuel-economy is a really big down side. Otherwise, better-priced then BMW and Audi. Way better, than Mazda and American-made SUVs."
acura,mdx,2009,Buster, 07/29/2009,Best in class,neu,"Driven my Sport/Ent MDX for 12000 miles now.  The drive-ability of this SUV is impeccable.  As in other reviews, I'm not sure it has 300HP, but it is enough. The smooth and quiet ride is why I bought it.  Stereo is good, but not earth shattering.  Nav is good, but has too many 'warning' prompts.  Can program on the fly, unlike others.  I really like driving at night and the headlights are great.  Have had one problem with compliance bushings, but dealership is very accommodating with loaners.  I don't like the key fob and think this league auto should have keyless options.  Not sure about the transmission, which is designed to help you brake, is all that comfortable, but it is sporty and smooth."
acura,mdx,2009,MDXer, 08/06/2009,Six Weeks,pos,"I've had my Tech Package MDX for about 6 weeks now.  I love it.  This is an amazing vehicle.  Comfort, power, handling, technology and the sound system is amazing.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone shopping in the luxury SUV market."
acura,mdx,2009,Marisol Wesson, 07/29/2009,Disappointment!,neu,"I am a complete Acura fan. I have owned 3 Acura cars (all TLs) and now my great MDX.  I fell in love with the MDX, its performance and reliability.. Feel safe and excited driving the MDX.  However, for some reason, and for the first time, I've had several electrical issues. First, the CD player got stuck and it had to be replaced.  Now, the electronics on the seats do not work, the memory is gone. The Bluetooth for my phone sometimes works but most of the time, I have to take my calls from the cell phone directly as the calls do not get through.  After paying so much money for this MDX, it is disappointing to be having so many problems. Yes, Acura dealer will correct all these problems."
acura,mdx,2009,2009MDXFAN, 08/09/2009,Best SUV in its class,neu,The 2009 MDX is a good mix of luxury and performance.  Interior styling is visually pleasant but Acura should not have skimped on quality of material such as the plastic interior handles and plastic fake wood.  The strengths of the MDX is definitely the handling quality compared to other SUVs.
acura,mdx,2009,1st MDXbuyer, 08/20/2009,Not a bad one,neu,"Got it a month ago after thorough study and many colleagues bought MDX previously. Overall it is a nice SUV and worth with its price. Good handling and smooth drive although steering wheel is too restrained to turn. For exterior I like front design, but tail looks terrible. Power is good, especially like the manumatic shift to satisfy sporty drivers. A typical sport SUV."
acura,mdx,2009,Mibrego, 08/24/2009,A True Luxury SUV,pos,"Now over the initial new- vehicle ""crush,"" I'm still very impressed with what this car is capable of.  Lives up to the designation ""luxury-performance SUV.""  I have subjected this vehicle to all kinds of conditions: towing a 4000 lb camper through 60-mile per hour gusts, plowing through white-outs on snow- covered roads in the Sierras, carrying three kayaks over dirt roads and sandy beaches.  In all these adverse conditions, this vehicle kept its cool and did its job with grace, power, and control.  It kept my family of five comfortable and safe with its arsenal of super-handling features. All of this, for a good $3000 below that of competitors with comparable features.  You do the math."
acura,mdx,2009,zisimom, 08/29/2009,Awesome SUV with good gas mileage,pos,"This is my 3rd Acura and 6th Honda product and I love it. I live in Washington, DC and with almost 100% city driving I am getting 19.5 mpg overall. That is awesome city mileage for a full-size, comfortable 3 row SUV. It is comfortable, easy for the kids and very intuitive. The entertainment system can be ""driven"" 100% by the back seat passenger (in my case a 10 year old) which leaves me free to listen to satellite radio. Holds everything I need it to. One big feature for me, even with the 3rd row up there's enough room in the rear for kids school backpacks, some sports gear or groceries. The SH-AWD satisfies even my BMW loving husband who drives a 2009 535xi. He was pleasantly surprised."
acura,mdx,2009,No1UKnow, 09/29/2009,Great choice for our family,pos,"After 6000 miles this summer, I'm extremely pleased with our MDX.  I really wanted a station wagon with a 3rd row seat and this was our best option.  Great leg room for the kids in the second row and I've ridden in the 3rd row.  Love the NAV.  Easy to use.  Bluetooth actually understands me!  Love how stable and responsive the car is.  Plenty of power when I need it on the highway.  Tons of cargo space.  Even with every seat in use, plenty of room for backpacks behind the 3rd row.  Didn't want a minivan and I feel like we've finally found the perfect family car.  I often take 300 mile+ trips by myself with the kids and I feel very safe in the car.  I occasionally let my husband drive!"
acura,mdx,2009,Will, 10/06/2009,Solid SUV,pos,"We bought our first MDX in Dec 08. 5400 miles later, my wife was T-Boned on the drivers side at a major intersection. The front/side airbags deployed and there was some $20K in damage. I must say I was impressed to the way the vehicle took the direct hit, thus protecting my wife from any serious injury. The other vehicle was totaled. Based on the location, and speed of the vehicle that hit our MDX, this little thing really took it well. We got it fixed and bought another one. They may be pricey, but they sure are safe and dependable."
acura,mdx,2009,bayarea, 10/21/2009,Extremely happy with my purchase,pos,"I've had my car for a week, so I can't really comment on the reliability.  I'll update it later.  I originally went out looking to buy a Toyota Highlander, thinking that was the only SUV that was in my price range, but the deals on the MDX have been crazy so I could easily justify the $5 more I spent on the MDX.  This car has everything I wanted.  The SH-AWD is awesome, the luxurious interior is really comfortable and has a ton of features and tech (I got the tech package).  The voice recognition is way better than my BMW I used to have and it drives much more like a sports car than the RX.   I ordered all my accessories off of bernardi acura for way cheaper."
acura,mdx,2009,jenny , 10/19/2009,Acura MDX Tech. Package w/DVD on Headsets,pos,"Our brand-new MDX was broken into and the window was destroyed and two DVD players on the headrest were cut and stolen after within one hour of purchase. We think the DVD headrest design was inferior, and can not be pulled out at all and no accessory to cover the two DVD sets. We think this is fail design and vulnerable to be stolen."
acura,mdx,2009,BRV, 10/26/2009,2500 hundred miles - so far so good,pos,"I have logged just under 2,500 hundred miles since August.  W/tech pkg I paid 40k + tax & title.  Vehicle handles well on dry and wet roads (no snow in our area yet). It is fairly quiet and very comfortable.  Overall great vehicle and best value in the ""upscale"" SUV class. Beats others in its class for the same money.  EPA 15/20. I'm getting 20 to 21 overall in mostly country driving where I live and commute to work.  Best feature: performance/handling/comfort combination  Worst feature: roof rack wind noise. I removed the cross bars and will just put them back on when needed. Very easy to just unscrew 2 screws per bar. Takes 5 minutes."
acura,mdx,2009,JRS-CSC, 12/04/2009,One of the best SUV's on the market,pos,"I love my MDX!!!! I do not know what SUV the other folks are driving, but my experience has been great. The MDX handles like a dream. The stereo is one of the best I have ever heard and I have had no issues to date. The only bad thing is that I am only getting around 18 miles to the gallon on average, 22 highway. The sport package has some of the best looking wheels and a nice leather upgrade. I love my MDX... "
acura,mdx,2009,cegledi, 12/06/2009,First Time Acura Owner,pos,"I'm excited to finally own an Acura. It's my first glimpse into the luxury world and am not a least bit disappointed. Wish they beefed up the standard features (back-up sensors, power tail, USB cable, etc.). However, I think the overall value and the performance of that sweet V6 makes me not care about much of the other stuff. So far, so good. Life is good."
acura,mdx,2009,MS, 04/26/2010,solid car,pos,"great all-around mid-sise SUV.  Exterior styling wears well, looks striking in black, with the red/brick leather. amazing sound system, has to be heard to be believed. As an enthusiast, amazed at how well the car responds when pushed hard.  Car seems to prefer being pushed hard rather than cruising.  Can at least chase my brother in his STI. Ride is a bit firm on long trips, active damping with a comfort mode needs to be standard.  Needs better quality interior materials and leather.  Simplified button arrangement on dash. Car is very sporty, maybe adding Brembos, and 50bhp would fulfill its potential."
acura,mdx,2009,MDXMAN, 05/01/2010,Great SUV,pos,"I love my MDX.  I have a black MDX w/technology package.  I opted for the roof rails and sport side steps. It is a beautiful SUV.  It has a great ride, ample storage, terrific acceleration and handles like a sports sedan.  I was considering the Audi, but the Audi's handling does not even come close to the Acura.  The BMW handled well but was now where near as luxurious or comfortable.  MPG are quite reasonable considering the performance of the engine.  I've had the vehicle for 9 months now and have had zero maintenance issues.  If you're looking for a fantastic luxury SUV, look no further."

acura,mdx,2010,Karol Kittelson, 07/30/2010,"Third MDX, Best Yet",pos,"This is my third MDX -- had a terrific 2004 and the then-new style 2007.  However this Advance model has the best Navigation on the market as well as the Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot Indicators and the Collision Warning system. Took a 4,000 mile trip recently, got 23 MPG, and enjoyed effortless interstate driving assisted by the Adaptive Cruise control.  In multiple lane Big City traffic, the side radar (Blind Spot Indicators) are priceless from a safety aspect.  (Side Note: In late 2009, I was the victim of a intersection T-Bone accident in my 2007 MDX and was saved from extensive personal injuries by the wonderful safety equipment in my Acura MDX). "
acura,mdx,2010,curious52, 03/30/2012,MDX torque converter failures,neu,"There are many, many MDX owners out there who have experienced torque converter failures over the years from 2002 up to 2010. For newer models there has JUST been a recall, within the last month. New software needs to be installed by the dealer. Be sure to ask if this recall applies to your car. 
My TC was replaced two months ago in my 2010 vehicle. I find it interesting that only now has Acura accepted the fact that a general problem has existed across many years of the MDX production. This damages my long-time positive feelings about Acura automobiles."
acura,mdx,2010,JJ10, 10/06/2010,Good Value and Lots of Gadgets,neu,"Have had the car for a month and overall quite happy with it. It is the best value for the money in this size/category. The tech pkg has tons of features, though some are more gimmicky than useful. Not crazy about the exterior, but interior is roomy and comfortable. Cargo area is smaller than I'd like. Performance is ok. The engine lacks torque and has to rev hard for power (while making a lot of noise). Coming from a European SUV, I feel the suspension is too soft and steering is way too loose. The torque vectoring is a bit unpredictable when cornering. Road noise is surprisingly high. The car had a couple of small issues upon delivery, which is disappointing for a Honda product."
acura,mdx,2010,BMart, 08/18/2015,This Car Eats Oil,neu,"This engine is a oil eater.  I got the car used form the dealer with a fresh oil change - at 4k miles later the check engine light comes on - I check the oil and it does not even register on the dip stick.   I thought OK -it was not a Acura/Honda dealer I got it from (Mercedes) so they put the wrong oil in or something.   I made sure it had synthetic the next time.   Same thing happens.  The other problem is Acura has set the maintenance interval to 7500 miles - way to long for this oil eater.  I recommend 3k miles for sure and check the oil every 1k miles.   The bummer is my old cars have oil that looks fine after 5k miles but this car just chews it up.  I now make sure I have quarts of synthetic available,  and I went and bought a funnel to add oil to this car every 1k miles.  I have to treat it like a vintage automobile.

Other than that it runs fine - it has a solid feel that reminds me of a BMW.

acura,mdx,2010,er405, 02/25/2011,Transmission Cycling will cause performance delays,neg,"I traded my new 2010 MDX after months of working with Acura Client Services and the Dealer. 

The MDX's progressive transmission, in my opinion, is poorly designed. Although, the driver is pressing the gas pedal, the MDX will have long delays during gear cycles. 

This could be dangerous if attempting to make a quck turn in on-coming traffic. You want to go, but the MDX moves very slowly or not at all.

Second, the cabin lets in so much air that during the winter, the heat must be set to keep the cabin warm, especially at the feet.

Last, the MDX looses lots of horsepower as it cycles through the gears. A sluggish ride at best. 

For the money, find something else. "
acura,mdx,2010,tp12string, 07/30/2011,The Best SUV Period!,pos,"After much research and test drives I selected the MDX. I test drove the X5, Q7, and Grand Cherokee as well as the Mazda CX9 and others. The MDX was overall the better choice....and less expensive than many of the others. After owning it for almost a year and 30K miles I can say that it has met and exceeded my expectations. It is very comfortable; the technology is easy to use and intuitive; the navigation is the best I've seen anywhere. If you are considering an SUV, do yourself a big favor and test drive the MDX. Best vehicle I've ever owned, and I've owned many new cars over the years."

This time the ""D"" indicator light starts blinking, no error codes. Dealer says the wiring harness between the engine and tranny needs to be replaced for $2K!!!. No the power train warranty doesn't cover this. Car has just under 75,000 miles on it. Really? The quality is so bad that basic parts can't last 75,000 miles. Putting it on Craigs list
as soon as I get it back.

acura,mdx,2010,CR1970, 10/08/2010,Impressive,pos,"I purchased one of the last 2010 Advance/Entertainment MX's that the dealer had on the lot and couldn't be happier.  We test drove a number of SUV's including the new RX, Highlander, and BMW.  The vehicle handles so much better than the RX and just seems to have a good balance of sport and comfort. I love the selectable ride option as well as the blind spot warning indicators.  The stereo system is AMAZING and light years ahead of my RX.  Voice recognition and navigation system were much better than the BMW we looked at.  The new 6 speed transmission shifts smoothly and pickup is impressive for a vehicle of it's size.  Fit and Finish is also impressive."
acura,mdx,2010,John Ta, 07/10/2016,Transmission failed at 45000 miles,neg,"I am the original owner and bought it in April 2010.  The car was awesome to drive at beginning.  It had pulling issue and grinding noise at low speed when turning the car right after leaving dealer.  Both these issues got TSB from Acura later on.  The grinding noise was not fixed since TSB came after warranty expired.  After 2 years,  the MPG went bad from 1 tank for 300 miles down to 200 miles locally and we need to down shift to passed another car.  At 45000 miles or 5 1/2 years, the transmission failed.  MPG went back to 300 miles for 1 tank of gas but the transmission is shifting so slow now.  I bought it since I love it's performance and handling.  My next SUV will be Lexus RX 350 since I bought lexus gs 350 and it changed me.  I have been honda acura brand fan for 15 years and it is over  now except Formula 1 Honda LoL

acura,mdx,2010,SW, 06/16/2019,Too many issues with my 2010 tech (disappointed),neg,"I bought the car brand new in 2010. Had many issues over the past 9yrs. A year after buying it, I took it to the dealer more than 3 times and complain about exhaust smell coming in the cabin and no one ever fix it. At times they won’t document it. They just call one of their mechanic  and he sprays freshener in my air vents and give me back the car saying that’s normal because the catalytic converter burning rich and it’s normal. I found a body plug fell off next to exhaust inner fender and once I replaced it it’s fine. About 5yrs later the roof seam between the tailgate cracked and water coming in the car when it rains. Dealer told me that’s body shop work and car is out of warranty so they didn’t fix it. I fix myself with silicone. The paint on the 2 front fender next to the hood flaking off on the edge and the lift gate paint flaking off above the Acura emblem about 3 inches diameter. The dealer said again that’s body shop to fix and car out of warranty so I had to fix it myself. My engine making a rattling sound when accelerating and the dealer said my tension pulley needs to be replaced. After paying $300 to replace it, it still rattles. Took it back they told me it’s a fuel. They said I cannot use premium gas from QT, Costco or sams club and I must buy from chevron or shell. What the heck??? After taking the car for a few times for maintenance I told one of the service advisor and he said I need a software update so the charge 1/2 hour labor. The transmission jutters a lot and the dealer say it’s normal. They want me to do a flush every 15k miles. What? The rpm gauge needle moves up and down between 1500 and 2000rpm when driving at 45mpg or 65mpg. Anyway, I did a flush and problem still there. I loose power to my sunroof and windows. Of course I had to fix it myself because it was out of warranty. Was a bad wire harness on the drivers door. All 4 of my shock absorbers went out. I don’t drive my MDX long distance, no bad roads, most of time I park in garage, don’t drive like crazy, etc. My oil level always low when checking it with the dip stick and the dealer says it’s normal. Don’t waste your money on this car. I wish Acura can read this and either buy my car back or cut me a check for the $4000 or so I sent in repairs. I don’t think I will ever invest in another Acura since I am loosing faith in their quality and workmanship. I owned 3 Acuras and my MDX was problematic. Of course I fixed everything except the rpm moving up and down and the transmission still jitters. Avoid getting a 2007 thru 2013. All these years have almost the same problem. Look it up on google or YouTube.

acura,mdx,2010,Pissed Acura Owner, 08/14/2019,Buyer Beware! Oil Burner!,neg,"I have a 2010 MDX base model and have owned since brand new. The MDX now has about 103,000 miles. I purchased this car due to its reputation for reliability, dependability, and longevity. 

In February of 2019 I got a letter in the mail from Acura explaining that there’s an issue with some 3.7L engines burning oil.  

After driving between 4000 and 4500 miles prior to back to back oil changes, the engine was bone dry with no oil on the dipstick. 

Prior to the latter oil change, the oil light came on and I notified the dealer considering the maintenance minder indicated about 30% life on the oil. 

I was advised to check the oil and if need be add oil. I did so adding about 3 quarts and the level still did not show on the dipstick. 

So a few days later I go into the dealer to complain and I begin the oil consumption test. After 1500 miles I was told my engine burned a half a quart and that Acura may not fix the issue since it’s not burning over 1 quart in a 1000 miles. 

I am pissed! Engines aren’t supposed to burn oil! Acura claims this is normal! BS! 

I may be buying a Lexus or 4Runner!

Honda/Acura has gone down in quality and are now on par with American manufacturers!

acura,mdx,2010,Mike, 06/19/2020,Great vehicle for the price,pos,"Hello, I purchased the 2010 MDX in June 2020. So far its a great SUV, lots of room, third row, seats fold flat, lots of tech goodies, sound system is really good. AWD seems to be more of a standard item with SUV's so I am glad the MDX is equipped with it. The middle row seats are surprisingly comfortable, if you haven't sat in them - try it out. We all accept that the third row seats are small - good for kiddos, not too much else. I like that the A/C system is linked in with the Nav so it knows when a passenger has the sun on them and will cool their side down more...neat feature.

Cons - As others have mentioned, not well insulated from highway noise, fuel mileage is so so (but it has decent power for the 3.7 v6). Timing belt will need to be replaced every 100K km's which does not appear to be a major job. The back quarter panel by the rear wheels seem to be somewhat prone to rust, take care of yours if it has avoided corrosion so far. Headlights have the same issues as all plastic headlights nowadays - they oxidize over time (can polish or wet sand out, just remember to use a good sealer after the job). Also, I am 6'1 and notice that it's quite a step out of the vehicle from a seated position, it's not a problem for me, but shorter folks may see this as a bit of an issue. 

All in all the vehicle seems to be well made and relatively easy to maintain. I hope it's a keeper!!

Update - 19 Dec 2020: Still a great vehicle, the only issue was with the spare tire hoist mechanism. When I added a trailer hitch, I discovered the problem, part was about $170 at the dealer, very easy to install. Very pleased with the amount of power the vehicle has, but again the fuel mileage is not superb. Put 10k km on since the last review and have had no other issues.

acura,mdx,2010,steve, 09/24/2010,Not so happy,neu,Have had 4-MDX's. The 10 model is the worse. Second row seats don't fold flat unless the second row headrests are removed. When removed there is no place to store them. More squecks and rattles than other 3 MDX's. Milage is not good for having a 6-speed trans. Recommended is 91 octane fuel. If use less the engine gives a fluttering noise. Dealer says tht is normal. This did not happened in any of my other 3 MDX's. Overall not happy with vehicle. Will look elsewhere when purchasing replacement vehicle.
acura,mdx,2010,jccai1, 08/10/2012,Not Impressed,neu,"Replaced a Volvo XC90 with the MDX in 2010. We were sold mostly on interior space, price (model year end) and perceived reliability. Two years later, I have to say I'm not impressed.

The car is just a chore to drive. The engine has very little low end torque. The ride is busy and floaty at the same time. The steering is loose and vague on center. A lot of road noise makes it into the cabin. And the transmission has slow and sloppy shifts, even after the software upgrade. After reading the horror stories about failed torque converters, now I'm really worried. Since it's the new 6-speed, I had thought Honda had fixed their transmission issues. I guess I was wrong!"
acura,mdx,2010,Vincent, 02/26/2010,So many problems already,neu,"I have owned 5 Acura and Honda products in the past (2 Acuras and 3 Hondas). All of them have been pretty much ""bulletproof"" in quality and reliability. This one has been a terrible disappointment! Where do I start? My MDX has been in the shop 3 times already in just 4700 miles! The transmission jerks erratically. The ELS sound system was fixed under warranty, and the vehicle pulls strongly to the right (Alignment has not fixed the issue)."
acura,mdx,2010,hamish, 03/28/2010,So much better than the 06 MDX,pos,"Have had my 10 base MDX for all of two days now. Biggest difference vs. the 06 MDX is that you actually look forward to driving this one! Reminds me of my 03 TLS, fun to drive, responds well, too fast for the kids to drive on their own!! Handling is very good, sticks to the road like an audi quattro, sporty handling, very little body roll for an SUV. Also very good for tall folk, my 6 ft 4 son, finds it very comfortable as both a passenger and driver. "
acura,mdx,2010,carollyn, 05/28/2012,MDX transmission issues,neu,"My husband and I have a 2010 MDX and it's been in the service dept almost 5 times with serious issues. two of those being transmission problems.

It had to have a torque converter with less than 30K miles.
It recently needed another tranny software update.
Steering and axle issues......Wow.
For 50K purchase, we shouldn't have these problems!!!

I feel like we need to get RID of this car while it still has a decent resale value.
DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT!! BUY ONE OF THESE CARS!
 It's been nothing but a headache for us.
 We are trading it in tomorrow.
 Will never buy an acura or honda AGAIN!!!
 EVER!!!!"
acura,mdx,2010,rajeshn, 02/11/2010,Excellent SUV,pos,"Purchased new, dealership delivered to home. Normal size from outside; excellent finish, pointy front grill; very spacious from inside; love all the advance features; adaptive cruise is really good. Traveled to Florida total 1600 miles no issues with comfort or reliability; unlike the space shuttle. The blind spot indicator is excellent as is the comfort setting of the ride. On returning home 1 foot of snow and the vehicle got stuck in it. Called Acura 800 number was told to call back after 2 hours if condition was same; no immediate help available. A BMW X5 parked adjacent to my acura and I was unable to identify my SUV till I noticed the fuel filler on the wrong side. Heat;sound;nav excel"
acura,mdx,2010,PalmettoSol, 02/05/2010,Lot's of fun,pos,"My first MDX was an '08 Tech/Entertainment, and my wife and I enjoyed it very much. I wanted a Sport/Entertainment at the time, but they were very hard to find. The first '10 MDX my dealer had was an Advance/Ent. and after driving it I had to have it. The '08 was great, but the '10 is even better. It looks more aggressive, the LED lighting is much nicer, and the extra gear is a nice upgrade."
acura,mdx,2010,octavian, 07/22/2010,"Acura Puts the ""Sport"" in an ""S""UV",pos,"I traded in an 2001 MDX for this SUV.  It offer the best price/performance in this category. Punch it, it goes. It is also not a car for the technology-challenged individual. It is packed with so much stuff, including adaptive speed control, blind side sensors, heated and cooled front seats, bluetooth, you name it. I don't get the issue with too many buttons. The dash is well laid out. Awesome suspension. And tight corners it does very well, with sport suspension turned on. I was taking corners like I was in a tl. Ok, not quite as fast, but unbelievable for a 2 ton SUV. "
acura,mdx,2010,kf, 09/23/2010,"one minor hitch, but great now",pos,"5K miles so far and loving it.  Rattling noise after purchase, took 2 visits to discover defective strut that was replaced without hassle.  Great for family trips with 3 little ones (and there are 3 latch connectors 2nd row which is nice).  Highly recommend."

"
acura,mdx,2010,Timothy Hart, 11/07/2018,Acura MDX provides excellent/reliable performance,pos,"I read about how good the MDX was and switched from an Escalade to the MDX.  It has been a completely reliable vehicle without a single visit to the dealer for problems.  My car looks the same as when I first drove it home.  The interior and exterior have held up perfectly.  The car drives the same as when I first purchased it.  It is roomy and when I need to bring a large load home, it does a good job.  The car drives well on ice or snow.  It has always been very comfortable and reliable.  I would strongly recommend this car.
"
acura,mdx,2010,curious52, 11/13/2011,Torque converter issue,pos,"There is some concern about torque converters in older MDX vehicles, but now this goes forward to the 2010 model. At about 35,000 miles, my vehciles began to hesitate and shudder when it was necessary for the transmission to change gears. I read some Twitter reports which gave me reason to take my car to the dealer. They road tested the car and agreed the torque converter needed to be replaced, covered by the warrenty. They also told me they had replaced converters on four other 2010 MDX vehicles. The job takes about two days as the transmission must be lowered to replace the part. There is noticable difference now. My dealer was excellent in how they handled the matter."
acura,mdx,2010,Richie Rich, 05/29/2010,Simply the best SUV,pos,Purchase my 2010 MDX Tech/Ent and without any doubt is the best handling SUV on the market.  The new auto shift is smooth and makes the vehicle that much more responsive. The 2010s are much more quiet and upgrades to the technology is amazing.  The stereo motivates you to drive more and  the seats and active restraints are so much more comfortable.  Stunning SUV.
acura,mdx,2010,brian, 07/18/2010,2010 vs 2009,pos,"Owned 2009 for 14 months and put on 23k was not impressed with overall quality i.e. both front Windows squealed when rolling down and wheel bearings replaced traded in for 2010 and what a difference the new 6 speeds trans is wonderful definitely glad I gave Acura another try base model purchased in libertyville il 39,500+ttl"
acura,mdx,2010,buddyguy, 02/28/2014,My mom drives a sports car,pos,"My mom bought a 2010 MDX used that I drive occasionally. At first I didn't like it, but once I drove it alone and realized how fast this car is, I dig it! The v6 sounds awesome under heavy throttle and the car takes off! The SH-AWD is great in the snow, and the car handles like a dream. Stereo sounds great. Leather seats are very comfortable. Sport mode with the paddle shifters is a lot of fun, almost like a real manual. Now for the not-so-good.. We had to have a new transmission put in at 25k miles. Acura did it for free, but just be warned.after they fixed it we love the car!"
acura,mdx,2010,John McGreevy, 02/28/2016,Love it,pos,"This is definitely a great SUV with superior handling.  The only knock is the poor gas mileage.  8/2018 Update (92K miles)--> one other issue (non critical) I have now is that the car burns oil very quickly.  For example, if I'm 2800 miles post oil change and the oil life reading in the car says 50%, the 'Low Engine Oil' warning indicator comes on.  It's not a faulty sensor either.  The car is actually down 2 quarts of oil after this time.  3/2020 Update (118K miles) -->  Turns out the low engine oil warning and the burning of oil fell under a Honda / Acura recall a year ago.  That was resolved by new pistons replaced free of charge.  I've also had several sensors go bad in the last year (tire pressure and one other).  Overall, the car is still in great shape and drives well.  I'm looking forward to gifting this car to my oldest when she's done with college in 2 years.
"
acura,mdx,2010,Discerning, 01/08/2010,Top of the Line,pos,"Switched from BMW X3 for more cargo room but did not want to give up handling. This one handles like a vehicle much smaller than it is and it has lots more bells and whistles than the BMW. It's hard to beat the way a BMW handles but this one is close, especially for its size. Great comfort and conveniences. Plenty of pep and a smooth ride. Exceptional technology. Perhaps the best luxury SUV value in the market."

acura,mdx,2010,Great Value, 02/03/2010,Great Value,pos,"I had a 2003 MDX and needed a new car. I really did not want another MDX because I had the last one for 7 years and wanted something new. I tried but nothing else compares in this class. This suv drives like a sports car, it the right size and is very luxurious. I put 104,000 miles on the my last mdx and just replaced tires, battery and brakes. It was solid and reliable. I am expecting the same from this. "
acura,mdx,2010,saturnoutlook, 06/01/2011,don't expect to carry anything heavy,pos,"Love this car, but unlike other SUV's I've owned this one is more car than truck.
On several occasions I have hauled cargo that the car should have been able to easily handle, approximately 300 - 400 lbs.
However, that was not the case, both times the car wondered all over the road, behaving like it was overaloded, definately not what I expected. "
acura,mdx,2010,JG, 01/27/2010,Acura MDX- Value over Price,pos,"We switched from a Tahoe and looked at an Enclave, X5, Q7, GX460, GL and the MDX gave the best value for the price compared against the others.  Smooth acceleration, superior navigation system and great sound system and features.  We lost some room but got some gas mileage efficiency and this car has got the goods to keep us happy for some time.  6th gear added this year to transmission which make rider smoother and more gas efficient.   Upgraded HDD, LED interior lights which add additional style touches.  AWD is amazing and truly a safety feature for those that are concerned about driving in bad weather.  Truly this car provides tremendous Value for Price and we are picky folks."
acura,mdx,2010,rhodymdx, 02/05/2010,Sweet ride,pos,"I got this vehicle mainly for comfort. I am a long-distance commuter and needed something more comfortable and luxurious than my Honda CRV, but with equal reliability. I am not disappointed. The seat is so comfortable and roomy; the ride is incredibly smooth and handling is great.  Great on the highway---watch that you don't go too fast---you may never notice before that flashing light is in your mirror!  A great luxury vehicle, especially for 40K..."

So far it is a great SUV, fun to drive, sporty but very comfortable handling,good stability on the road, luxurious and spacious. Got it for 2.9% promotional APR, so a great deal. Absolutely love this car and very happy with professional dealeship. Wish it had a  better MPG."
acura,mdx,2010,Repeat MDX Owner, 02/13/2010,Happy so far!,pos,"Bought 2010 MDX w/Tech Pack 3 weeks ago. Happy so far. Have 2002 MDX that has been good vehicle. Got new one for $41,903 - way below the TMV. Really happy about that. Thats only about $5K more than we paid 8 years ago for the 2002 Base model that can't compare with the new technology. Love the interior and wonderful stereo/NAV/HDD system., but all the buttons & various owner manuals are a little intimidating. The ride is similar to the 2002 in terms of feel and ride quality, so not a real cushy ride, has some road noise, but also a sporty feel like all Acuras. The best blend of space, performance, MPG, maneuverability, luxury and resale value on the market today."
acura,mdx,2010,Richie Rich, 02/17/2010,What an SUV,pos,"I replaced my 08 MDX and what an upgrade. The 2010 MDX is so much more refined, responsive, and quiet. The technological improvements are extremely good.  Love the chrome window trim, less aggressive active  head restraint and the silky smooth 6 speed automatic transmission."
acura,mdx,2010,Sleepysam22, 02/14/2010,Nice looking SUV,pos,I have owned several MDX'S and the 2010 Advance package is by far the best. The 6 speed trans is smooth and responsive. The navigation with hdd is the best I have seen from any manufacture and I have looked at them all as I am a big time nav/tech guy. The seats are more comfortable than the previous MDX that I have owned. The led interior lights are really cool along with the blind spot detection. Collision breaking system and the adaptive cruise control. Very nice car
acura,mdx,2010,stma1, 02/25/2010,My 2010 verse 2007,pos,"I just picked up a 2010 Base Model, it is much improved over my 2007, the new six speed transmission really makes the vehicle responsive, the handling is awesome, improvements over the 2007 include, thicker more comfortable steering wheel , higher quality leather, new "" xenon"" like interior lighting, and yes I do like the front much better, overall a much higher quality feeling vehicle , my 2007 had over 95000 miles when I traded it in, no major issues at all, hoping for the same with my 2010."
acura,mdx,2010,RC, 03/19/2010,Great Family SUV,pos,"I finally gave into Japanese engineering after years of driving only European brands. The last straw was a terrible BMW experience. I have never been so satisfied with a car. The combination of comfort, space, performance, safety and reliability is great. I wasn't willing to compromise on any of those features and the MDX was the only one that met all of my criteria. The safety ratings really sold me due to the fact that I have a teen driver learning on this car and another one coming up in 2 years. Decent fuel economy given the size of the MDX."
acura,mdx,2010,jvette, 03/31/2010,2010 MDX TECH,pos,The MDX has been a wonderful experience and has help up to my expectations. The seats are very comfortable and this thing will flat get up and go. 
acura,mdx,2010,FUN SUV, 03/31/2010,Fun SUV,pos,"I drove the X5 and the MDX.  The MDX won because of the extra's, its quiet, fast and I love the gadgets.  Everything for me is in its right place.  BMW interior mechanics is too complicated and take your attention away from the road to use.  "
acura,mdx,2010,Antonio, 04/04/2010,Excellent Choice,pos,"I upgrade from a Mitsubishi Montero 2001 to the MDX 2010. The MDX handling is great and the interiors are awesome. The sporty looks is the best not a round, bulky look."
acura,mdx,2010,Jay, 04/04/2010,Good Value,pos,"I looked at ML 350, Audi Q7/Q5, and X5.  The MDX seemed to offer the right features for the right price. I am completely satisfied with my choice.  It is a solid car that is fun to drive."
acura,mdx,2010,triceptive, 04/06/2010,Comprehensive Review! Nice SUV for a fam,pos,"Just purchased the MDX Tech Package a week ago and so far I love it. With the addition of our second child we needed a bigger car because our sedans were just not cutting it. I looked at: BMW X5(way overpriced - smaller then MDX) AUDI Q7(Overpriced - did not enjoy the ride) Buick Enclave(GM quality is not so good after years of use and I plan to keep this car for 10 years)  I chose the MDX because the price was right. Another reviewer said that they dealer would not lower the MSRP. HA. I say that person has no negotiation skills. I got mine for $41, 700, a few hundred below invoice and over $4000 off MSRP. ($47,400 out the door). 1.9% APR is great too. Buy at end of the month!  "
acura,mdx,2010,Joe Dimitrius, 04/26/2010,2010 MDX Tech,pos,"Bought the 10 MDX Tech a month ago. Looks great in black. Love the ride. Compared against the Q5 (smaller), Q7( much more expensive), Lexus RX (very girly) and the X5 (more expensive to own). Zeroed in on the MDX. 45 out of the door. Yes, wait till the end of the month."
acura,mdx,2010,Brian, 04/29/2010,Enjoying the MDX Experience,pos,"I have put some miles in the drivers seat and find the MDX is what I was after in comfort, styling, performance and safety. I typically drive distance spending hours at a time on roads in different states. The MDX seems to glide on smooth surfaces with little sound or feel from the road. However on rough roads, I notice wheel noise. I am impressed with little sound from the outside entering in the cab. I forget what other vehicles sound like as they rush by in this car.  I enjoy the sound systems as do my boys with thier IPODs. The cornering and handeling of the MDX gives me confidence that I can quickly manuever when needed especially in rain. "
acura,mdx,2010,Hilbilly 385, 05/03/2010,A solid value,pos,After a month or two  of ownership we are quite pleased with our MDX. Build quality and features are excellent. It has a quiet ride and feels stable at 80mph. The seats are comfortable and the Navi/audio system are excellent. While not a sports car it handles very well and gets up to speed nicely. It has an excellent balance of exterior size and interior capacity. Recommend highly.
acura,mdx,2010,Dr. T., 05/04/2010,2010 MDX even better than the 2007.,pos,This is my third MDX.  It is even better than my beloved 2007 MDX.  Much better sound system and much better backup camera.  This is the SUV for those of us who love the performance of a sports car.
acura,mdx,2010,charlie, 05/07/2010,Very impressed with 2010,pos,"The new 2010 MDX provides a smooth and quiet ride, with excellent body control in the corners (even w/o the Advance pkg).  The restyled front/rear- ends lend a more aggressive look, and together actually makes the car appear bigger than before.  The voice commands are intuitive and easy to operate, and the premium Milano leather seats are incredibly comfortable.  As with the previous gen, the fuel economy is only average for a V6.  With an MPG in the teens, I would've liked to have a bit more low-end torque, although it's a decent performer for that kind of size and heft.  The throttle is responsive and the new 6-speed auto is silky smooth.  It's a very well-rounded SUV and a great value."
acura,mdx,2010,Tom , 05/16/2010,"Great Car, lousy gas mileage",pos,"This is a great car with great comfort.  The interior is awesome and the ride is fantastic.  The advanced tech package and entertainment system is top notch.  My only real complaint is gas mileage, less than the 20 they advertise in the highway and about 15 around town"
acura,mdx,2010,Archie, 05/18/2010,Good car,pos,"This is my first MDX although I was buying Honda\Acura for the last 15 years. SUV drives like sedan, quiet in comparison with average Honda..Nice interior. "
acura,mdx,2010,Bob, 05/25/2010,Love this Vehicle,pos,"We just bought this vehicle. I got a very good price on this vehicle ($47,500 out the door). I also got some great accessories included in this price. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. We took a trip to Oregon (from Washington) and the ride was exceptionally smooth and handles great. I've owned several SUV's before, but never like this.  The cool gadgets is what I love about the MDX. NAV Voice recognition, automatic tailgate, keyless remote starting system, DVD entertainment system to name a few. I told myself ""one day I will get a luxury vehicle"" and now I finally got one! If you are shopping for a luxury SUV, I recommend the MDX.  You will be very pleasantly surprised.       "
acura,mdx,2010,Beantown 7, 05/27/2010,A very well thought out vehicle,pos,"Have owned many SUVs over the last decade, last 2 cars were a Cadillac Escalade and a Porsche Cayenne.  This vehicle has all the amenities you need in a well thought out package.  Excellent stereo in the ENT package, very useful blind spot indicator, great Nav, even the 3rd row is ok for kids. Excellent seats and ride is comfortable.  Forget the BMW and Mercedes, pricey and not nearly as comfortable inside."
acura,mdx,2010,CGDSAIL, 06/08/2010,Handles like a car,pos,This vehicle is a real pleasure to drive. The mileage is not great but I am getting 16 in the city and 18 for mixed driving and the car is not broken in yet.  I expected the mileage to be much worse during the break-in period.  The NAV system and other Tech features are great but all the buttons can be confusing. The bluetooth hands free phone feature and NAV voice commands are easy to use. The sound system sounds fantastic and the IPOD link works easily.  The back-up camera with a choice of three different views is a very nice feature.     
acura,mdx,2010,Denise, 06/10/2010,Love it! Love it! Love it!,pos,"I picked this car up 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it!  While it's still early in the ownership experience for me, I have had no problems at all yet.  I have read some comments about the dashboard being cluttered with buttons, but this has not been an issue for me and I find everything easy to operate and understand. I purchased the Advance package with White Pearl exterior and Umber interior and it's beautiful!  It's so much fun to drive and the acceleration is swift and exhilarating!  I'm looking forward to many happy years with my new baby!"
acura,mdx,2010,CAMDX, 06/18/2010,Best luxury SUV on the market,pos,"The mdx is my first Honda/Acura, and after almost a month of ownership I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality, workmanship, and technology features of the mdx. It has plenty of room for a family of 4 . The handling and acceleration are top notch for an SUV of this size and weight, you feel confident driving it. Love the navigation, voice activation, and bluetooth connectivity. Dvd entertainment system works great. Awesome sound system. Well thought-out interior. Aggressive exterior design. Definitely a better buy for the $$ compared to other luxury SUVs from BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo. Highly recommend to others!"
acura,mdx,2010,luvCARZ, 07/05/2010,Best in class but,pos,"We bought it b/c MB gl450 lease ends in 4 months and my wife doesn't want to keep paying 2 car loans (leasing MB amg e63). Before gl, had 07 ml, 05 rx, and 01 mdx. Test drive all usual suspects. Mdx has best quality (as good as MB) and tech for price range. But I have 3 complaints. 1. Feel under power for 300 hp feel less power than 07 ml (263 hp) and hwy wind noise. 2. Questionable fuel economy. 19 mpg combined in mdx. 18 mpg for my gl450 only 1 mile diff. Hmm? 3. Quality of back-up camera is worst than my Prius. What's up with that ! "
acura,mdx,2010,Todd, 07/09/2010,Trip need more DVD Audio,pos,"I just took a 4600 mile trip from San Diego to KC down to Nashville and stopping off at Memphis. The ride of the car superb, seating is the most comfortable, I am 6'1"" and 270 lbs and never have been in a vehicle so comfortable. The AC unit did exceptional while driving through the desert in Arizona and New Mexico it was like instant cool when turning the car on after stopping for gas or food. "
acura,mdx,2010,jrdonta, 08/12/2010,Perfect 7 seats SUV except some issues,pos,"The SUV is perfect so far except the following issues 
1. Car pulled the the right (dealer fixed and said it is steering not wheel alignment) 
2. After dealer claimed fixing pulling to the right issue, the car still pulls to to right or left depends on different roads. 
3. When I reset trip A mileage average, the trip B mileage average is reset also. 
4. Accidentally, I turn of VSA then the car does not pull right or left any more (  VSA system issue? ) 
5. The plastic bolt holding cooling pad under the hood are losing after 1 week. "
acura,mdx,2010,db5644, 08/24/2010,A good blend of everything,pos,"Good upgrade from our trouble-free 2004 MDX. Honda/Acura continues to give the U.S. market what it wants in a SUV i.e. the right size, the right features, dependability, safety, resale, style (except not so much in the MDX front ends)and a choice between good value in the Honda and Luxury in the Acura. After a lot of study and considering Consumer Reports opinion, keep coming back to the MDX for the best package in a luxury SUV. "
acura,mdx,2010,Happy Owner, 08/31/2010,Very Happy,pos,"Just bought my MDX last week.  So far I am VERY impressed.  Bought it for my wife, she had owned an '03 and loved it.  I finally talked her into buying the new one so I would enjoy driving it around with the kids and her on the weekend.  I have an '05 TL and this car is just as fun, if not MORE fun, as my TL.  Handles great, lots of tricks and toys and looks fantastic.  My only gripe is the gas mileage."
acura,mdx,2010,Tien, 09/04/2010,Good Value for the money,pos,"Owned 2003 MDX and was very pleased with the reliability.  Did not want another MDX but ended up getting this one instead of the RX350 due to Value for the money.  RX350 is actually more expensive than the MDX and does not offer 3rd row seat.   Vehicle drives great so far. A couple of things.  a)  It required premium fuel.  Wife did not know and put in plus instead.  This caused the vehicle to jerk when transitioned from first to second gear.  One premium fuel is used, problem went away.  b) Leather seat is fairly easy to get dirty.   Interior is compatible with RX350.  Lexus used to has much better interior in the past but 2010 RX350 has similar leather grade as MDX 2010."
acura,mdx,2010,danny1878, 09/04/2010,Best Handling & Very Roomy,pos,"Acura electronics, SH-AWD, ACC and body roll is the best (feel like driving a sedan). Wish it has better MPG than 19.7. Roomiest seats among competitor such as RX, BMW, etc."
acura,mdx,2010,Bruced4, 09/12/2010,Gotta love this one!,pos,"Fast, nimble, comfortable, killer stereo. This is an amazing vehicle. It drives more like a sports car than an SUV. Incredible in the corners. Great power throughout the RPM band with smooth delivery from the 6 speed tranny. I have heard some complaints about gas mileage but I get 18 all around - quite good for this size vehicle. I think this is probably the best value in a luxury SUV out there, so make sure it is on your test drive short list.   "
acura,mdx,2010,Newowner, 09/09/2010,A well rounded SUV,pos,"I cant believe its almost better than a sedan, the way MDX controls its body roll, sudden stop with almost no head bobbing. Very quiet compared to my TL'04 and a ton of gadgets. I've always said that I'm not really into SUV (not fast enuf, heavy bodyroll, poor handling and sipping gas like crazy). Those impressions I got after i test drove X5 n RX but MDX adv has both world. With Adv model's price, I cud go with X5 premium or diesel, but reliability is my main concern. 7 seat is also a plus, bigger than X5 and it seems MDX sells better. After watching a youtube's video how MDX was compared with audi/RX in 20-30 degreed steep climbing an icy/snowy ramp, I knew my choice."
acura,mdx,2010,Brent, 10/10/2010,Disappoited,neu,"The audio system is both good and horrible. The AM radio is the worst I have ever heard on any vehicle, regardless of price. There is no mid-range at all, making it sound as though it is being played through a megaphone. Interestingly enough, when playing the hard drive, or CD, it sound much better. "
acura,mdx,2010,JR, 10/31/2010,Awesome SUV,pos,"The powertrain (engine and transmission) are unbelievable smooth.  The six speed transmission is a significant improvement over the previous 5 speed one.  Seat comfort is a perfect 10 as is the interior design. Handling is agile, especially for a vehicle this size.  Outward visibility is excellent, the ELS stereo sounds fantastic along with its USB/IPOD integration and the ability to rip CDs right to the hard drive.  The leather is soft and supple and the ride is extremely composed at all speeds.  A sporty yet comfortable suspension is the way to go and this vehicle nails it.  Gas mileage is as expected given this vehicles size & weight if no better than others for its size."
acura,mdx,2010,SJ, 11/14/2010,The Sports Sedan of mid-size SUVs,pos,"Traded in a 2005 Honda Pilot. The Pilot's acceleration, cornering, and braking can't compare to the MDX. I have it out on the twisty roads of the Sierra Nevada. It feels like a decent sports sedan, not an SUV. The interior ambience if the MDX is way more luxurious than the Pilot. Another huge difference is road noise.  There is very little road noise in the MDX.  Gas mileage is disappointing.  At 8,000 miles on the odometer, I am still not hitting the EPA highway mileage on longer trips.  So far it is has not had a single reliability issue. If is is as reliable as my previous 3 Acuras, it will be a 10. "
acura,mdx,2010,yar7, 01/24/2011,Overall satisfied but plenty of room for improvement !!!,pos,"After having a bad experience with the dealer who insisted & put a different remote starter because of supposedly Acura's is not reliable and dealing with Acura headquarters who were not responsive to our complaints, I am now content with my 2010 MDX ,7,500 miles on it. There is room for improvement in terms of gas mileage, noise reduction and quality of interior materials."
acura,mdx,2010,mark3840, 01/02/2011,A little disappointed,neu,"This is my wife's car although I drive it often. I'm not a huge fan of the MDX. It suited our needs and was a good value compared to other luxury CUV's. Way too many buttons and very confusing to navigate the controls and nav system. Voice commands are useless - even difficult to make a simple phone call.
(In the Genesis you just push 1 button and say, ""dial home,"" for example.) Nav & stereo, although rated high, doesn't even belong in the same league as the Genesis. Seams are not tight. Quite a bit of noise for a lux CUV. Good power and ride as well as fairly comfortable. I like it overall but I hope Hyundai comes out with a luxury CUV soon, because it will blow away Acura."
acura,mdx,2010,Pedro Rivera, 01/04/2017,Kick ass sports sedan with SUV cargo space.,pos,"I was looking for an SH-AWD TL, but after a long story with a dealer ended up with this MDX; and LOVE IT!!! It is a fast SUV, with sports sedan like feel. Loving the dealers screw up!!!
"
acura,mdx,2010,maryalyce, 05/15/2018,Love this MDX Technology Model,pos,"This was my first Acura. I switch from a Volvo because the technology was lacking in the Volvo. I have been very pleased with this car. I do take it to the dealership for service. I have no complaints with this car, except the voice command can't understand my commands sometimes!!!:)
"
acura,mdx,2011,kris2, 09/02/2011,Best value,pos,"Needed a sooner than expected replacement after my 2005 X5 3.0 got totalled. After looking at 2012 X5, 2011 Q7 and 2011 MDX I ended up purchasing the MDX and I am not disappointed.

In terms of performance I did not feel it a lot different than the X5. Torque felt low but there is enough power when you need and the brakes feel good. 

Been getting 17 mpg in mixed driving with 60-70% city using premium. 

Kids like the third row though the access is difficult like all third row SUVs. Seats are comfortable and provide support. You will get used to the power tailgate and backup camera in no time. 

Got the roof rails (should have been standard) so it looks like an SUV and I like the look."
acura,mdx,2011,becca00, 05/11/2011,WOW!!!,pos,"This is my second Acura (first was a 2010 TL Tech).
I fell in love with Acura after my first one, this one is even better.
I came out of a 2007 Suburban into the TL.
Great for me but my kids (boys, 16 & 12) didn't have as much room as they would have liked in the back seat.
So.. traded it for the MDX.
This is, by far, the BEST SUV in it's class.
I wake up everyday and cannot WAIT to drive it!
Somewhere, anywhere, I don't care as long as I'm driving.
I live on a curvy, hilly road and this car handles like a sports car (I have a MINI S too, so I know).
Handling, braking, steering, interior, exterior- all perfect.
Only one thing... just a LITTLE too much road noise.
Still the best!!!"
acura,mdx,2011,ploftis, 08/02/2011,Best 7 Seater Luxury SUV,pos,"We've had the MDX for about 2000 miles now and absolutely love it.
It's extremely comfortable and has a very smooth ride which is balanced with excellent handling for something so large.
Power is always there, but shines with highway passing which is exceptional
Looks beautiful inside and out and has the most comforable interior I've even been in.
The controls take some getting used to but once you do that, the technology is excellent."
acura,mdx,2011,el_pic, 01/25/2011,2011 MDX Advance,pos,"MDX = Multi Dimensional LuXover. It's not a rugged 4x4 SUV and its not a sports car but it is AWD and a luxury performance way to 5+2. Compared to 2011 others in its class (and be certain to compare the same class) ... Ten:
Infinity FX - Nine: Grand Cherokee Overland - Eight: Land Rover LR4 HSE - Seventh: Volkswagen Touareg V-6 - Sixth: Volvo XC90 Sport - Fifth: Lexus GX470 - Fourth: Mercedes-Benz ML350 - Third: BMW X5 3.0si - Second: Cadillac SRX AWD V-8 - First: Acura MDX.
Better price, handling, dependability, fit, finish. Enuff said !

Pros: Luxury Performance Value Dependability ! 
Cons: Single engine drivetrain choice - no Turbo, diesel, hybrid. "
acura,mdx,2011,janetrich, 09/28/2011,Heated Seats,pos,"I purchased the 2011 MDX in August and simply love the SUV.
I have always owned a Honda and wanted to own the luxury line of Acura.
I love the car but since I drove it out of the dealership I have had problems with the drivers side heated seat (back rest).
It feels like it is always on.
I have taken it back to the dealers and they ran tests on it but insist that it is fine. But my back always sweats.
They will not do anything about it but have told me that other people have brought in their MDX saying the same thing, that the back of the seat feels like it is always heated.
Does anyone else have this problem?
Maybe if enough people complain they will issue a recall."
acura,mdx,2011,swedenva, 04/08/2011,MDX with Tech Package,pos,"I purchased 2011 MDX from Pohanka Acura, largest dealer in U.S.
Got the best deal from all dealers in DC area.
Others not even close.
Pro:
Fit and finish; ride and tech package;


Con:
gas mileage, third row seats for adults cramped; visors cheap; premium gasoline; not enough cup holders;


Overall, very satisfied and expect to keep 5+ years. Still a much better value then the BMW X5; Mercedes GL/M Class; Infiniti QX56; Cadillac Escalade and Lexus GX460."
acura,mdx,2011,gdh12, 03/03/2012,"Aggressive styling, great value & a blast to drive",pos,"Unlike any other vehicle we have owned, after 16 months and 30k miles, I still get excited at every opportunity to drive our MDX.
I love the unique, aggressive styling and, after driving large SUVs for many years, the sports car feel and performance of the MDX makes it a blast to drive.
The interior is roomy, high quality and very comfortable.
Second row seats are comparable to front seats - very comfortable for adults or children.
The technology and entertainment packages are outstanding - best nav and DVD systems I have seen.
Voice activation features work great.
We average about 16 mpg in mostly city driving, but get 20-21 on freeway trips, better at lower highway speeds.

 "
acura,mdx,2011,mmr183, 10/03/2011,Great choice for nexus of features / function / value,pos,"Delighted with driving performance and comfort in our MDX. Owner profile can help, so share we are 55-plus couple and retired. Key factors for us in vehicle purchase are safety, comfort, cargo space, driving ease and reliability.


Considered Volvo XC90. Lexus Rx & GX, BMW x3 & x5.
Nutshell version is we didnt think any measured up against MDX for nexus of features / function / value.

Small snafu in our MDX has been the voice recognition system doesn't always translate some female voice commands correctly. 

We like the seemingly controversial grille / front end design. Looks sleek to us. Beauty in the eye of the beholder we guess. Love the look of the Bronze / Parchment combo."
acura,mdx,2011,svofan1, 09/26/2010,2011 MDX BASE..GREAT !!!!!,pos,"Just purchased the MDX base model this past Saturday, and so far I am very impress with the quality of build, features (bluetooth is great ) and in general very please with the purchased. I know is too soon but so far I am not regreting getting the base model over the TEch....afetrall $4k difference to me is a lot for nav and a few other features that I will not ahve a great use for"
acura,mdx,2011,tolson37, 05/04/2011,Simply Awesome,pos,"Very nice package - I've had about 30 different new cars and trucks over the years and this is a package that has sport, utility, technology, comfort, reliability, and safety all wrapped into a single package.
I have 2500 miles on my 2011 Tech with Entertainment system.
Not one thing has gone wrong.
Enjoy every ride / trip in it.
Plenty of power and nice powerband with 6 speed transmission."
acura,mdx,2011,kbgcpa, 11/03/2010,Acura MDX 2011,pos,Picked up 2011 Acura MDX on Saturday after trying to get a good deal on a   2010 but dealership made me a good offer. Had a Lexus RX 330 and then 350 for the last six years. Glad I switched needed more room but still wanted luxury. Drive is very powerful and I actual like the front grill which I could not stand at first. The buttons are very easy to get used to just use the tutorial online.
acura,mdx,2011,suitespot, 01/16/2011,"My first, but definitely not my last Acura!",pos,"A most impressive vehicle.
Mechanically superior to any other comparable tested.
Great ride, terrific fit and finish.
Traction -- starting and stopping -- with Michelin's in Michigan winter is great.
That tuning of the suspension at Nurburgring made a great AWD even better.
And, it's made in North America!

Can see why Motor Trend and Car and Driver have rated at top of class!"
acura,mdx,2011,tornadog, 11/11/2011,A nice upgrade from the Pilot,pos,"The MDX is a perfect marriage of a sturdy, well designed SUV witht e comforts and handling of a car. The interior is very nicely designed, the tech gadgets in the car is a treat to use. The rid eis super comfortable and while the mileage is a hog, it is still better than my 2010 Pilot."
acura,mdx,2011,maxbailey, 12/28/2011,Disappointed about my dream car!,neu,"I have been waiting nearly 7 years to buy an MDX.
I purchased my vehicle just over 6 months ago.
I love it...it is beautiful!
However, it has left me stranded several times and the technicians at Acura are stumped.
A message keeps appearing...""check starter system.""
Acura has had my vehicle on several occasions now.
They replaced the computer system and thought the problem was solved.
However, this morning after the vehicle sat in my garage for 3 days, I got in the vehicle and the XM radio stations were all reset to the preview channel, my #1 driver memory was gone and the a/c was on max.
I never leave the a/c or heat on when I shut off the vehicle. Tonight the vehicle won't start:-("
acura,mdx,2011,thomas642, 04/07/2011,"Nice ride, but-------------",pos,"Living in central Florida but bought in IL. have seen a vast variety of driving situations.
Handles excellent on snow and ice and does well with side gusts of wind.

Considered Enclave but build quality of Acura far superior.
MDX built like a vault.
Would like to see better gas mileage and wonder why the need for premium fuel and no cyl. deactivation as in my past Honda van.
Mileage as advertised though.
Only problem so far is occasional cruise control issues as it will cancel and car has to be shut off to get it to work.
No help from Acura on this.
Best radio I've ever had by far and I've had some good ones.
In black with optional chrome wheels, it's a beauty I love to drive."
acura,mdx,2011,panic492, 02/27/2011,"Very Good Value, Fun, Some Improvements Needed",pos,"I have had my '11 Nav/Tech for about a month now and I am overall very happy. The engine is silky smooth and the seats are very comfortable-it is a pleasure to drive. The tech ""stuff"" is great-nav, voice, IPod recognition...I also looked at the Audi Q7 (close 2nd choice) and BMW X5 (distant 3rd choice). My small complaints about the MDX are the fake wood trim, it is plastic. When the sun hit's it, it blinds you. Also, the visors are very flimsy. No big issues so far other than my AC is giving me a bit of a funny smell, probably needs a new air filter. Should be a reliable, fun SUV. "
acura,mdx,2011,KingofKings, 09/21/2015,Most Reliable Luxury with out breaking the bank,pos,"Try and get the CPO with an extended warranty just for a clear mind, but you might not need it, vehicle is highly reliable in my opinion.  Interior could have been made more attractive looking in comparison to other luxury vehicles but than again the MDX cost a little less.  Audi Q7 interior is someone better but the car is less reliable, and cost more to maintain.  I will highly recommend this vehicle, there may be others with more luxurious options but they would cost more to maintain.  Just Be aware of some dealerships service personal creating a residual customer out of you.
"
acura,mdx,2011,pjc123, 08/17/2011,"Solid Choice, very good vehicle",pos,"We have owned the MDX Tech for 4.5 months and 5,300 miles.
Overall, we are really happy with the vehicle.
It is good looking, fun to drive and perfect for our family of 4 to go camping and on vacations.
The gas mileage has been slightly over 18 combined which is fine by me.
The only suggestions for improvement would be the transmission and stereo.
Granted, we were ""spoiled"" with an Audi but... the MDX is smooth shifting but sometimes you have to coax it to the proper gear especially when it is loaded up.
The ELS surround sound is just adequate but NOTHING like the Bose in an Audi.
All that said, I know the Acura will be MUCH more reliable than the Audi.
I also own a 2006 TL."
acura,mdx,2011,Michael L, 09/02/2016,Couldn't be happier!,pos,"Bought mine used with about 30k on it. I now have 107k on it and could not be happier. I did tons of research before selecting this make and model. The instrumentation and navigation is excellent! No car I have ever driver beats its user friendly approach and boasts the same functionality. Acura service is fantastic. You get Lexus like service without the cost. Sure its more than my wife's toyota or a Honda, but only marginally. If I had to come up with a complaint it is this: I get all service done at the dealer and just about everytime I am in there they have some sort of recommended service. Then again, I think all dealers do this. It has plenty of acceleration when using the paddle shifters (which are great), but the std acceleration could be a tad better for those very heavy foot drivers. But the handling is great and the driveability is perfect. SH-AWD is money in the corners and about 18mpg with this is good enough for me - esp since I have a heavier foot. I am a big guy at 6'5"" 260lbs and this car gives me plenty of room. Even the back seat is nice with its reclining seats. 3rd row is for small adults or kids. I highly recommend this vehicle to just about any driver - you will not be disappointed!!
"
acura,mdx,2011,Let Down, 01/12/2018,Great until about 115K miles,neu,"Loved this vehicle until the engine started burning oil at 115K miles. Online forums showed I was not the only one with this issue. Great ride and handling, lousy mileage with premium fuel. I would rate this vehicle a 5 star if it would have lasted as long as I was hoping it would."
acura,mdx,2011,Mike Greteman, 01/30/2017,Be Wary of Surprisingly Expensive Repairs,neg,"I bought my 2011 MDX used from a family member, who had put 100,000 highway miles on the vehicle. For the most part, I have been very happy  with the performance of the vehicle, however I was shocked to receive a $4,000 estimate to replace my front struts and rear shocks from the dealer for the car's ""electronic"" suspension. At the dealership, the Acura maintenance person told me the expense would be covered under the extended warranty. As Acura had extended the warranty particularly for problems with the SUV's electronic suspension, they had acknowledged the problem and were doing the ""right"" thing by repairing it for free. However, the maintenance person went back on his word and subsequently informed me that my vehicle actually did not qualify for the extended warranty. I further voiced my complaints by calling the Acura Care line, and the representative told me there was a good chance that Acura could make a ""goodwill exception"" for my vehicle, allowing the repair to be covered under the warranty. However, once the representative called me back, he informed me that because I bought the car with greater than 100,000 miles on it, albeit from a relative, it did not qualify. I just wanted to post this review to draw attention to my experience. Overall, I have enjoyed the car, however I will never buy an Acura again. $4,000 - $7,000 expenses on a car worth $17,000 doesn't make sense, and I’ve been very disappointed by the false promises made by the company.

acura,mdx,2011,steve, 11/06/2010,Great SUV,pos,"Was in the market for a vehicle with third row and this fit the bill perfectly! Compared with the bmw x5 i kept coming back to this suv for comparable ride/handling and the price difference was the clincher! 3rd row standard on MDX, upgrade on BMW, leasing a base model with NOTHING out of pocket for $610 a month!!!  will add DVD player for kids for 1k later on and get a garmin for Nav.  no need to pay extra 10k for all the extra gadgets. the performance and exterior of the truck are the same no matter the tech package."
acura,mdx,2011,tmh1, 03/11/2011,Great family SUV.,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 6 months and am very happy with the choice.
I looked at the Mercedes M-class, the Audi Q5, a Subuaru Outback,
and a Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland.
I chose the MDX because it had the best overall package for my needs:
nice interior for work, rear leg room, navigation system and electronics, and good handling.
The navigation system and voice commands are the best - recognizes the voice easily.
However, it is not optimized for all Blackberry phones, so keep that in mind.
This SUV drives like a car and is a breeze to park.
Kids don't complain in back seat and I have teenagers.
Great family car. "
acura,mdx,2011,bgf18, 12/11/2012,Good - with minor complaints,pos,"2011 MDX - Tech Package.
Decided to buy out our 2011 MDX lease...my wife loves it that much. This car is very comfortable on the road as it is reasonably quiet and seats have excellent support. Visisibility is good for an SUV. Room for luggage is minimal with all three rows being used, very good when only two rows. The SH-AWD works really well, but I would GLADLY give it up for a front-wheel drive version if GAS MILAGE would improve. Fit and finish is good, although I could live without the three square feet of PLASTIC wood on the dash. For a family of three, this is the perfect SUV. Fam of four would be ok, five would be tight. More than five is pointless unless going on short drives."
acura,mdx,2011,jrm1955, 06/19/2012,Another quality Acura product,pos,"This is one of many Acuras I have owned over the past 20 years and I could not be happier with this vehicle. It is roomy, comfortable and provides a level of performance that I was not expecting from a large SUV. The adjustable suspension has proven useful by giving the choice of a comfortable ride or sportier handling. Gas mileage is par for the course in this market segment. Resale value is also strong which was another factor in my choosing this vehicle. Love the sound of that big V6 too when you pull out to pass. Much more entertaining than a Lexus RX350 to drive."
acura,mdx,2011,Jeff L., 11/27/2010,Nissan Sales Manager Hung Up On the MDX,pos,I have been in the auto industry for 14 years and have owned over 50 vehicles and now with 3 little girls of my own I have come to understand the value of space and reliability and the MDX has all of these on its mind! We traded a 2010 Honda Odyssey in becuase if the overall minivan depression most parents feel  when the switch is made and this car not only does it all but easily fits 2 car seats and a booster. The controlls are easy to manage and the MDX drives like a sports car. I am an Acura fan and this car is no disappointment if you have the means do yourself a favotr and get one!

Some reviews call it a large SUV, but to the owner of a Chevy Suburban and a GMC Acadia, it is mid-sized and shows it most in the third row seating. Other reviews have covered the high points - quality of materials, driving position, handling, power, transmission, and the fantastic ELS sound system among them - so I am going to focus on the few things that detract and may have all been corrected in the latest model. The backup camera at night that is so dark it is dangerous to rely on for backing up. The radio tuning knob seems to be geared at 50:1 - you'll know what I mean when you try to go from Channel 18 to Channel 176 on Sirius/XM. The side mirrors do not fold electrically. The tailgate that does not power open when using the outside hand release. The third row seats do not power up and down, an inconvenience when hands are full. And there is no push-button start/keyless entry, which is hard to explain when so many other contemporary, comparable vehicles have it. On balance, however, I enjoy owning and driving the 2011 MDX. The engine pulls well, the transmission always seems to be in the correct gear and drops down quickly for rapid acceleration, and the steering is quick. The relatively short wheelbase makes parking easy. The high-beam headlights are as outstandingly bright as the backup camera is dim at night. The center stack of the dashboard - the topic of broad criticism - is straightforward if you compartmentalize it into three sections: top for HVAC, middle for media, and bottom for navigation/information. The ride is compliant and not too harsh for an SUV. The buttery-soft leather seating is of a very high grade and the front and second-row seats are very comfortable. After 67,000 miles it looks brand new. A great mid-sized SUV that seats five adults comfortably and two children in the third row in a pinch.

acura,mdx,2011,John N., 05/23/2016,Overall -Best car I've owned.,pos,"Dealer repair quality is lacking consistency.
In 6 years and 92k miles the repair bills have been less than $500, outside of routine maintenance.
New tires & brakes last month, 79,000miles each and still had wear to go ( not much).
Terrible nav system, Acura is UN-responsive and so is the supplier. Gets lost-can't even find the local hospital. 
Entertainment system is good but not worth the money. the Tech Package is a rip off.
HVAC has some quirks but OK. Seat coolers broke down(poor quality parts )and had to be replaced. Extended warranty paid. Can't imagine true cost to fix!
Backup lights are TERRIBLE - buy some LED ""reflector"" type bulbs from Amazon $20. They help
gas milage is poor 18-20. 
ACC - adaptive cruise control is FANTASTIC. can't wait for lane holding etc.
Super luxury it is not -but a nice car that always runs (so far) and doesn't break you wallet.

acura,mdx,2011,danmoch, 01/02/2011,"Excellent value in a 7 seat SUV, awesome in the snow!",pos,"Purchased '10 MDX in June '10. Needed an AWD/4WD SUV >5 seats with tow hitch, priced under 50K. Also have '09 BMW X5 35d (diesel) which I love. First looked at another X5, but 3rd seat optioned vehicles were hard to find.
The MDX drives well everyday, has nice electronic things (nav, rear cam, bluetooth, ipod/usb adapter.) Rear seatbacks tilt back a few degrees making the difference between an okay seat (BMW) and a nice relaxing one. Interior space definitely bigger/more usable than in '09 X5.
Where the MDX really shines is its snow traction. This car is better on snowy town roads in the Tahoe area than my X5. Note MDX = Michelin Latitude tires, BMW = Bridgestone Dueler runflats."
acura,mdx,2011,DILJIT KARAYIL, 10/28/2010,A Great Buy,pos,Took me 4 months and a lot of comparison to nail it down to the MDX.Compared to BMW X5 and Audi Q7 Great stability and handling.Does the corners well. Good Pick Up and a host of convenient features.GPS w/ weather and traffic is great.3rd row is ideal for kids and slim adults but other than that it is spacious. Braking is smooth and the headlights are nice. 
acura,mdx,2011,akanorm, 03/03/2011,Excellent Value,pos,"I've had the MDX for about 2 months and have driven it about 1k miles.
It handles well for an SUV and the quality and the technology is equivalent to that of BMW and Lexus.
I also, considered the A4 and A6 Audi, Avante,
The A4 was too small and the A6 was not readily availability
subsequently the dealer were asking nearly list price for the A6.

Overall, I'm pleased with the car and would suggest others in the market for an SUV to test drive the MDX."
acura,mdx,2011,Jennifer, 01/17/2017,2nd Best Car Purchase EVER,pos,"The first was my 2000 Acura MDX. I have owned several vehicles as my husband was a dealer (Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, Range Rover, Cadillac). I have to say for the price, quality, gas mileage, and room the MDX is my favorite! It is affordable and offers all the things you need most in a day to day around town vehicle with children. Comfort, class, room, and options are excellent. The dealership here is a pleasure to do business with as well.
"
acura,mdx,2011,Nj mdx owner, 07/19/2019,Great Suv with Engine issue,pos,"After owning 2 Acuras, one CL and one MDX, Acura is still a great carmaker, however if an acura has an issue, it is almost impossible to deal with the Acura Dealers! My Acuras had to get transmission replaced and engine fixed due to losing oil. The warranty covered both, however extremely difficult to get dealers to acknowledge these kind of issues. They are dismissive of you until enough customers complain! It's frustrating, ridiculous and very bad customer service! Otherwise these acts are fine and hold up well and are reliable but the MDX not so good on gas.
"
acura,mdx,2011,Ned, 11/22/2019,Excessive Oil Consumption,neg,"We like the MDX for the first few years, however the oil consumption is more than acceptable as the vehicle ages. We need to add more oil because it’s bone dry before the maintenance minder even reaches 50%. Acura ran the oil consumption test and claims its within spec.  I wasn’t satisfied with this answer and tried to push the issue and now they’ve stopped returning my calls.  I’ve always like Acura but after this experience it has me rethinking them on future purchases.

I Love EVERYTHING about the car except a few things like not having a push start, and the Gas Millage could be a lil bettter. Moving to Cleveland so will need an AWD can't wait to see how it does!!!!"
acura,mdx,2011,jack1973, 09/19/2012,2011 Acura MDX,neu,"I had this vehicle for 18 months and recently traded it in due to a couple reasons.

- on a combination of city and highway driving I was avg'ing 16 mpg. I understand its an SUV but find this number unacceptable.

- The interior in this vehicle is horrrible. Not only is the design bad but the leather is cheap and showed massive wear with only 10,000 miles on the vehicle. The dash is covered in fake wood and there were many rattles in the car.

The ride is extremely hard and road noise is prominent.

Exterior is really nice but the interior and gas mileage really started to weigh on me.

I guess thats what you get when you try to make a Honda a luxury car."
acura,mdx,2011,mvarga, 12/04/2011,Good Value,pos,"I have had the 2011 Acura MDX w/Advance Package for about six months now, and I somewhat regret my decision to buy an Acura.
While the ventilated seats and blind spot assist are great, the interior quality is lacking. For a car that costs over $50,000, I would expect a lot less plastic and authentic wood trim.
If you are looking to buy a seven passenger midsize SUV, I would also consider the Lexus GX460 or the Audi Q7 because both of those vehicles have interiors that are far superior to that of the MDX's.
Overall, I think that you get a lot for a cheap price.
I would definitely recommend the Advance Package because it has many useful features."
acura,mdx,2011,Chae, 11/02/2010,MDX is awesome!,pos,"MDX is my third time car. I got impressed by the new technology of this car. I could feel this car gives me a very comfortable and fast reactiong driving time while I am in the car. I can't believe this is SUV. Especially when I make  turnings on curved roads, this car gives me real safe turnings; well-balanced, smooth, and fast. And the navigation technology is so wonderful that I am not afraid of visiting anywhere I have never been to. Also, the sound system of this car is very very cool! I feel like I am in a theater while I watch a DVD. My Kids love watching DVD in this car sooo much. No doubt! "
acura,mdx,2011,bala_71, 08/12/2012,Not worth the hype..,neg,"First of all, I am
surprised that why I am alone in finding lots of minute problems with this SUV. Are people insanely happy about owning a poorly designed SUV? These are not 20K Civics. Having said that, I am not going to argue that this should drive like a Ferrari or Aston Martin. But come on!
With in the last 11 months, I had to visit the dealer for vibration issues many times. One issue they fixed by adjusting the suspension system. But now I have a vibration in steering wheel at above 70 mph. The dealer convinced me that that's how these cars drive.
I think its due to the factory installed tires. But they won't accept it! I now have a vibration coming from the roof-top too!"
acura,mdx,2011,jon, 10/07/2010,2011 MDX - terrific nav and stereo,pos,"Picked up new Acura w/ tech package a week ago with silver roof rack and running boards, very comfortable seats in front and second row with plenty of leg room, love the exterior styling and just today went on a trip to the airport to drop off a family member and returned rush hour crossing the nyc metro area; made much easier by the nav system which redirected around various congested traffic areas and the upgraded stereo is probably the best I have owned or heard. Performance has been improved in 2010 by Acura on the MDX and it makes it a much smoother and peppy drive than the 2009 and prior."
acura,mdx,2011,SMB, 09/30/2018,Best car I've ever owned! and most comfortable!,pos,"The comfort of the leather seats, both front and back, is outstanding.  The stereo system is fantastic as well.  My only complaint is the gas mileage.  I bought the car used and have owned it for four years.  No issues whatsoever.  The grandkids love the third row.  You can easily put three car seats in the middle section.  I can't see me driving anything else now.  Love it!
"
acura,mdx,2011,Leon, 05/18/2020,Great Vehicle,pos,"This is a great car, we bought it because our family is growing larger, we upgraded from an Acura TSX. We love our Acura MDX and all it has to offer. The cooled seats are great in the summer and the sound system is superb with our Entertainment Package. The SH-AWD gives us confidence since we live in a climate with snow and ice in the winter.

acura,mdx,2011,sinew23, 08/29/2012,Not a luxury car,neg,"I leased this car last year because it had the lots of leg room and cargo space and overall seem like a good choice.
Unfortunately after driving it for a year, I've been disappointed numerous times by the way Acura cut corners to save a buck.
It just doesn't feel like a luxury car.
It basically feels like a Honda.
This car is not nearly worth the $50K price tag it touts.
To add insult to injury, the sales team at the dealership was horrible.
Do not buy your Acura from Hendrick Acura!!!
I'm so disappointed by this car and the service that I'm in the process of transferring my lease. I just can't drive or pay for this car any longer."
acura,mdx,2011,Nesser94, 08/20/2019,Very reliable! Premium Gas sucks,pos,"I bought my MDX after researching it for years. I knew it would be reliable, and it has been for the six months I’ve owned it. I’m disappointed with the insane amount of money it takes to operate the MDX. Going from a smaller car averaging 24mpg with unleaded to an SUV averaging 16-18mpg on premium is not fun. I will be selling my MDX for this reason as my family is expanding and cannot justify the gas expense. Maybe one day I will buy another one when I can afford the premium gas. 
"
acura,mdx,2011,acuraleak, 04/27/2011,Worst car ownership experience,neg,"Within two weeks after purchasing the MDX, with 300 miles only, transmission fluid leaking was found.
It took 2 days for the dealership to fix the problem. 
It's a nightmare owning this car. This will be my first and last Acura. "
acura,mdx,2011,whomiam1, 11/14/2011,Don't get Nav - waste of money,neu,"I purchased a 2011 MDX earlier this year and got the tech package in order to have built in navigation.
I love my old Garmin and wouldn' travel without navigation again.
Unfortunately after purchasing it I found it to be so outdated and inaccurate that it is nearly useless.
I have to install my Garmin anyway.
I later learned that Acura uses a system made by a little company that has no credibility.
WHY!
You would think that with Acura's reputation on line they would look for a REAL nav system from one of the major producers.
I just hope i can prevent others from making the same mistake.
PS: if your thinking of getting a Lexus instead their system is apparently even worse."
acura,mdx,2011,xfbai, 04/30/2011,MDX quality and reliability,neg,"Was so happy after bought a 2011 MDX Base model on Saturday, however discovered a problem the very next day that it would jerk when decelerating from 35~40MPH to around 15MPH without breaking. The jerk is 100% reproducible and getting worse and worse. Brought back to dealer twice and finally convinced them it is problem that need to be fixed. Eventually they figured out that a secondary valve on the transmission is faulty! How could this happen on a brand new car? 
After replacing $200+ part, the problem is fixed. My new car has to stay in the shop for 3 days in the very first week. Really worry about the build quality. It will be my last and final MDX."
acura,mdx,2011,richtn1, 07/20/2011,Not my Old MDX,neu,"After 3 months My 2011 MDX is now on a Used car lot. I owned a 2005 MDX that I loved! It rode great, was reliable and got decent gas miliage. 
The new version is nothing like that. It rides like a Dump Truck, guzzles gas and is like being in a torture chamber. Seats are hard, controls are annoying and confusing. To top that, the dealership was awful. I purchased my previous MDX from Crown Accira of Richmond and it was a fun experience, This time ,the sales person was texting on my test drives and most of the time acted like she was doing me a favor taking me out. The manager was eating chicken on a console right as you walk into the dealership. It was a real side show. Horrible!"
acura,mdx,2011,g35shopper, 12/20/2010,Moved from a Lexus RX,pos,Took delivery of a 2011 last Saturday. Mostly very pleased. The exception would be the mpg. My Lexus was bullet proof but just too dull to buy another one. The MDX handles much better and the transmission is much more decisive. I do have to admit that I can tell why the RX commands a price premium. The interior and the controls in the MDX feel cheaper (although acceptable).

Why?
Well, I am looking to downsize my life while not giving up everything.
Then MDX offers all I need and what I want.
Versatility, sportiness, comfort, performance, and better MPG.
Thought about LEXUS, MERCEDES, and found the pricing too high.
The Range Rover does not provide the reliability and resale of ACURA."
acura,mdx,2012,Dave M, 04/25/2017,Oil Burner!,neg,"Bought a used 2012 MDX to replace a 2007 MDX.  Quickly discovered it burns oil at a rate of a quart every 1100 miles.  Thought the previous owner had abused the engine and not changed oil regularly.  WRONG. Seems that most ""reviewers"" and organizations have missed the fact that Acura has a bad engine - the J37A - out there on the 2008-2014 MDX.  A new cylinder material is rumored to be abrasive against the piston rings - and the oil is being burned quickly.  Acura has taken the stance that a quart/1000 miles is ""normal.""  And they are only ponying up money to totally irate consumers with signing of an NDA.  There is the rumor that the rings were installed improperly at the factory.  Initial statistics show that over 11% of Acura MDX's have this problem with the J37A engine.  Advise strongly again buying unless some warranty guarantee from Acura.  The problem has shown up in cars with as few as 40,000 miles.  Usually AFTER the warranty is expired.  Caution!!!
"
acura,mdx,2012,jg88, 04/14/2015,"My ""New"" 2012 MDX - 2k miles so far",pos,"Just bought a 2012 MDX Tech CPO with 30k miles and am pretty darn happy with it.  Tested the X5 and X3, the Q5, the ML 350 and the similarly sized Infinity; the MDX was hard to beat for overall driving, quality build and standard features.  SH-AWD is in a class of its own for on-the-road traction and performance.  Driving during a couple of heavy down pour is a breeze.  Surprisingly it has decent ground clearance for logging roads and unimproved two-tracks yet felt lower in driving than the others.  Noticed how low in the bonnet the engine sits, must be how Acura lowered it's center of gravity.  Lastly, could not believe the deal I struck with Acura vs. the German cars - much better.

Three years later, now with 52K miles - not one issue or problem with the MDX.  We've taken it many long trips, have used it for carrying large items - still going great as a people and cargo mover.  One area of concern, the MPG seems to have fallen both for local and highway driving.  On a recent 3K trip from TX to NM to CO and back back, overall MPG for the trip was about 19.5.  A year earlier, on essentially the same trip, it was about 21 MPG overall.  Have also noticed lower MPG for local driving, about 15 - 16 versus 17.5 during the 1st 2 years.  Not sure why this is.

Our needs were to fit full size cello in the back, 3 kids, 7 sitting capability occasionally for a car pool.
Drivability and passenger comfort with technology to protect them.
Acura MDX won at the end with the Advance and Entertainment features and space.
 Mercedes GL was close, had good room but much more expensive if decked out and the reliability history was not as good if reading feed back from internet.
Did not drive as easy as Lexus GX and Acura.
Lexus GX was best liked by driver sitting but not by the passengers (kids) secondary to cramped 2nd sitting and incredibly cramped 3rd row even for kids."

I had planned to buy a smaller 4x4 such as the Acura RDX or Honda CRV, but the MDX has the road manners of a smaller, sporty vehicle along with every convenience and safety feature I wanted.
Gas mileage was a concern until it returned over 21 mpg on 1,000 mile round trip while fully loaded that mostly exceeded legal Interstate speeds.
I expect better when it is broken in.
The ability to control so many vehicle functions by voice is amazing and the Acura navigation system (reputedly the best on the planet) even knows its way around the back woods of South Carolina!"

The car drives and handles very well and comes with a laundry list of standard options.
I wanted to check out the new Explorer before we bought this one but the Ford dealership was too difficult to deal with.
A relative of ours just bought the Toyota Highlander which I also like but the MDX handles better in my view.
I was also able to get a better deal than the Edmunds True Market Value.
Our kids love the car."
acura,mdx,2012,sebring95, 12/07/2013,Great value and decent features,neu,"We've had this for a little over a year and 30k miles.
It was really no more expensive than a loaded Honda/Ford/GM SUV.
Normally I wouldn't buy a ""luxury"" brand for our family hauler given the 25k-30k miles per year we drive, but operating costs on an Acura are a fraction of the Euro brands.
Depreciation also appears to be significantly more favorable.
Transmission is relatively lazy and you have to keep after it to capitalize on the 300hp.
Backup camera is terrible at night.
Gas mileage is as expected...averaging 19.5 and 21-22 on long trips at 75mph.
Unless you're comparing it to something significantly more expensive or smaller, this is a great overall vehicle."

I now feel I have a win/win situation. I have the elbow room I sought, and don't feel I've given up any significant features. I now have a navigation screen I can see in the day or with my sunglasses on. The voice command system is more reliable/logical. The sound system seems just as good. I now have the hard drive storage for CDs. The power and acceleration seem better. The interior has high quality materials. It is a little thirstier by about 2 miles/gal. I miss the keyless ignition."
acura,mdx,2012,Lee Hoagland, 07/08/2017,Great SUV substitute for sport sedan,pos,"I’ll try to keep this short and simple.

• The gen2 MDX drives much smaller than it is. Even with the high ground clearance, it rivals many sport sedans, especially with the Advance pkg that comes with the Active Damper System (ADS) in sport mode. The overall dimensions (length, height, width, and track) lend themselves to a wide, stocky, and aggressive stance that handles very well.
• The J37A1 engine is no slouch and while the 0-60 split isn’t fantastic at 7.1 seconds, it has more than enough torque for brisk highway merging and passes. Bear in mind it is a high-revving engine, so you really have to get it above 3500rpm to really let it purr. 
• The most annoying thing about the MDX is the shift mapping on the transmission. It is constantly trying to upshift prematurely, sometimes to the point that it seems something is wrong with the powertrain. I do not use mine in Drive mode; I always have it in Sportshift mode with the paddles engaged, so I have full control over when the transmission gears up. It does not turn it into a DSG or SMG, but it allows you to hold gears through turns and up hills, or gear down to prep for a highway pass. The engine has rev-matching, so it helps ease it into gear more than most automatic transmissions.
• While rated at 16/21mpg, you will rarely see better than 18mpg if you use the paddles routinely. But, this is the price of having a sufficiently powered 4,550-lb vehicle that can hit the twisties better than the majority of crossovers, and better than some sedans.
• The SH-AWD is fantastic and one of only a few torque-vectoring 4WD systems currently available. The only vehicle in the same class that has a comparable 4WD is the Audi Q7. The X5, RX350, XC90, and JX35/37 have atrocious 4WD/AWD systems that do nothing but add additional cost to the vehicle. The SH-AWD is highly advanced and is an incredible feature to have.
• Wind noise is minimal as the aerodynamics are quite good. The engineers at Honda spent a lot of time in the wind tunnel making sure this beast was comfortable at highway speeds and it’s a very comfy ride.
• If you are a performance oriented driver, definitely grab the Advance trim if you can. Additionally, look at the ATLP or RV6 J-pipe to replace the stock J-pipe. These $500 bolt-ons can add 15-25awhp, which translates into 25-40bhp. A custom CAI, resonator delete, and high-flow rear mufflers would put your output in the 340-360bhp range.

I am downright shocked, I can see carpet staples, the carpeting stops in odd places so it looks cheap, the fake wood is horrible...some hard to touch interior parts.
The service is horrible, at two dealers, one makes excuses, I point out issues and he shows me new models that have the same issues...such as a sticking glove box handle, squeaking at the b-pillar, hood plastic cushions that fall off, etc.

Outside of the relatively poor build quality and craftsmanship (clearly not built in japan mind you) its an ok car, but acura needs to improve.

Update:  Its been four years with the car...my initial review has not changed, as time wears on the car runs rougher...it revs higher and hold its too long...dealer says its normal.  Cannot wait to move on to my next vehicle, this one has been a bust.

acura,mdx,2012,MPMDX2012, 01/18/2019,OLD SCHOOL.....MAKE SURE AND CHECK OIL!!,neu,"Bought the 2012 MDX new....  a year ago (jan ""18) low oil level message came on for the first time.  Had to add 2.5 qts to get dip stick back up to standard level.  Since that time, have found that it takes 2.5 -3.0 qts of added oil between 5,000 miles oil changes!!  Since MDX now has 96,000 miles on it, haven't discussed issue with Acura dealer.  Note:  in addition to MDX, purchased new Lexus es 350 in 2008 which now has 200,000 miles... have never added drop of oil!!

acura,mdx,2012,Jay Cassius, 03/19/2018,IT AIN’T WHAT IT SHOULD BE !,neu,"It should sell for a lot lot less. In 2017, I bought the 2012 MDX used. 55k miles. I wanted a 3rd row SUV. Was in perfect condition, inside and out. Test drive was ok. Had only heard about Acura’s high end reputation. For the high price it must be pretty good? It ain’t. It’s not especially attractive. The dashboard and controls are pretty primitive. The buttons are cramped together, hard to read, poorly positioned. The multi information screen has  so many layers of headings and sub info that you need a special course to figure it out. Just to adjust the interior lights and door locks takes about 20 pages in the manual. Not because it’s intricate, but because it’s preprogrammed somewhere in China and they probably got the module for pennies. Like inexpensive furniture that you spend a day putting together yourself. It’s hard to get in and out. The driver seat is so high you have to lower it so your feet can get near the ground. I’m 5’10. The doors are short, too short, so you always bang your legs and feet trying to get out. You have to move the seat pretty far back so you can swing your legs out. The wood grain? panel along the dash couldn’t even pass for plastic, let alone wood. The electronic throttle is downright dangerous. You get to a highway on ramp, ease up on the gas before you accelerate....  hit the pedal.... nada... that hesitation is enough to give you a heart attack. Oh well, that’s the electronic throttle, nuttin they can do about it. I had a 2008 Lexus RX 350 before this. The MDX tries to be a cheap imitation that costs as much or more. Not even close. The 2008 Lexus was better in every way, except for the 3rd row seat. And I bet no one ever got the 16 estimated miles per gallon. I had to make a conscious effort to get 12. I’m trading it in before 6 months.

Several times have been told by dealership this car is fine and it sounds terrible. When turning at low speeds it sometimes makes a loud thud and clunk mostly after rain or bad weather when in reverse or parking the car.

acura,mdx,2012,pwr1, 01/11/2014,Buyer Beware...,neu,"I spent over $50,000 on an SUV that is all talk and no walk.
Everything about this vehicle exudes quality and detail - until you try to go up a steep hill like your driveway.
WTF.
The vehicle shifts up immediately, then slows down almost to a stall, then shifts down hard, goes 20ft then shifts up again.
I was embarrassed as hell, and as soon as I can dump it I'm going to.
Don't waste your time or money.
I'm headed straight toward a real SUV like the new Yukon Denali etc...
this was a wast of time and money and reputation on Acura's part.
The dealers know about the shift problem, but they won't discuss it with you (I know an out of town dealer srvc rep that confirms this). Angry now."
acura,mdx,2012,Celestina Madera, 03/18/2016,My expectations were higher,neg,"I had a 2009 Acura TL previously, and I really miss it.  It was GORGEOUS, Sleek, Quick, very comfortable, easy to keep clean, and had terrific technology, including a great NAV system.
By contrast, the 2012 MDX was a 'boat' of an SUV.  
'Quick' is NOT in the vocabulary; underpowered comes to mind.
It's comfortable enough, and functional, but no WOW. 
The steering is 'fine' but not agile.  
The interior was light, which I like, but all I remember is monotone.  
I felt like a Soccer Mom, and I don't have kids.

acura,mdx,2012,AZEsq, 10/09/2019,"Loved it til 100,000 miles",pos,"I'm a late LATE reviewer, but I've owned the car, which I bought gently used at 40,000 miles, for over three years. At 103,000 miles all hell broke loose. LOL. In the last 12 months, I've spent $6500 on this car +/-. We did the 100,000 mile service, which was $2500 by itself, then we were instructed that there was some obscure part that needed repair, which was $2000. Tires and oil don't count, but we've also had an alternator come up--which, FUN FACT, only ACURA alternators will work on this car. Our emergency mechanic (it died in the middle of nowhere on the 4th of July, ugh) ordered one that ""should fit"" the MDX and it does. IT works, but the stupid computer is always threatening me to ""Check charging system"" and if I'm stuck in traffic or idling or using my radio AT ALL for more than 20 minutes or so, it starts dinging at me scaring me that I'm going to be stuck on the side of the road. Honestly, I've loved the car and I'm frugal enough to know that we're keeping it, but if I could go back to 2015, I'd buy a minivan. LOL.

UPDATE: The MDX obviously (at some point) realized that we were not going to re-replace the alternator and stopped regularly dinging about the charging system. It will, however, still do so if I'm idling in traffic for a long period of time or waiting outside with the car radio on, which is not ideal. Overall, however, I still love the car. The ride, which was why I purchased it, hasn't really diminished in the last 70,000 miles. I live in DC where the potholes are aplenty. I expect a bit of a bumpy ride, but my car compared to my sister's newish Altima are night and day. It's still fairly smooth and the car has been really easy to maintain since the debacle last summer. Considering that we drive it at best 3 times a week now that could be contributing to my joy with it. Honestly, now that I take metro almost everywhere, I have no impetus to buy a new car any time soon. But I still get the itch. And every time it comes up, the MDX is still at the top of the list!

But the elecronics inside are sub par. Even non luxury (Ford) has better electronics. For example the screen is not touch screen and resolution is poor. There are duplicate buttons for every on screen function. In other words, navigation screen and the functions available there including audio are a duplicate of existing buttons resulting in cluttered dashboard.
Rearview camera is cheap and has poor resolution. Doesn't work well in dark and during rain. Almost monochrome. Wish the side mirrors could be folded from inside. Its a wide SUV and I need to fold the mirrors to park it inside the garage."

Motor vs tranny - never mach torque to gear, so looks like you have 300hp for nothing. Make it to up/down hill you will see how hard it goes.

acura,mdx,2013,AmithW, 11/23/2015,BEST SUV IN THE CALSS,pos,"I always buy less than 2 yr old cars. Due to high mileage driving(25K/yr) I cannot lease. I compared the BMW X5, MDX, Lexus RX 350, and Benz GL class. After loads of research and test driving it was easy to zero in on the final 2 of RX 350 and MDX. MDX won due to following. Exceptional road handling over RX 350. Killer looks to match the Road handling. Excellent acceleration combined with the growl from under the hood makes you feel like a F1 race driver. And finally I only saw 5 star user reviews for MDX. I have now clocked 45000 miles in 2 years. (No major repairs only maintenance so far) Still feel like a kid getting into it every morning. Feels good to drive it knowing it will not fail me and give me the best driving experience. I just returned from the 2016 LA Auto show and realized my MDX is still so very good. I do get 17.5mpg combined. Highly, highly recommend this car. I wish Acura continued with the same or higher powered engines for the 2016 and up models. I strongly feel when one's willing to pocket out $60K price tag 2 or 3 mpg shouldn't be an issue. I shall have mine for 2 more years and hopefully by then Acura will come up with a higher hp MDX...
"
acura,mdx,2013,Anonymous, 08/14/2016,Satisfied with my Purchase,pos,"I purchased my 2013 MDX in April of 2016 as a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle. I researched the vehicle for about 5 months before finally making a purchase, I wanted to make sure I was buying a reliable vehicle since the car I traded in for the Acura was less than reliable. While I am overall very satisfied with my purchase the MDX did fall short in a few areas, at least for the 2013 year, there is no push button ignition, backup camera is very blurry and useless at night, and the vehicle likes to shift out of first gear very quickly which can be aggravating instantly losing that power(shifts at about 2200 RPM, would be smoother shifting around the 3000 RPM point), I also don't like the lever release for the parking brake, I'm use to ""push to release"" parking brakes, but it's no big deal. With those 4 complaints though, the MDX makes up for it in other areas. For starters, it runs great, there is no shortage of power and the engine has an amazing sound running through the RPMs. The vehicle also handles like a dream, you can take it on a mountain road and not feel like it's going to tip over or that you need to crawl up the mountain. Of course the appearance is what first caught my attention to consider the MDX, I have received nothing but compliments from coworkers and friends over the way the vehicle looks, it has a very aggressive front and rear end. The stereo is also amazing, while I could stand it to be a little louder at times, most people are not going to have an issue at all. I also get decent gas mileage, I average around 20 MPG, given the size and horsepower I don't consider that bad at all, although requiring premium gas does make that number a little irrelevant spending at least 50 cents more per gallon at the pump than a rival running on regular. One issue that has been prevalent since I purchased the car has been a vibration that comes and goes, after changing 2 of the tires it went away then came back a few weeks later, running the car to 5500 RPM completely eliminated the vibration, now only a slight vibration shows up on rare occasions and goes away shortly after. I have also noticed complaints about bearings going bad fairly quickly on the MDX, I have an appointment soon to check a slight roaring noise that I believe may be one of the bearings. Overall though, i would recommend the vehicle to anyone.

acura,mdx,2013,Dan O, 05/20/2018,No complaints,pos,"This is a great SUV.  I’ve had nothing but a good experience owning this Acura MDX.  It’s a great ride.  It’s reliable and I got a great deal on this used SUV two years ago.  You keep up with the maintenance and it will not let you down.  It’s got good room for passengers and stuff.  The far rear seats are a bit tight,but it’s very rear we use them. Other than that, this is a great vehicle.
Update: Nov 2020-  This car is pushing 8 years, and I have 107k.  It’s been a perfect car.  I keep up with the suggested maintenance and have had no issues.  I am more than satisfied.  This is one of the best vehicles I’ve ever owned."
acura,mdx,2013,Jean Hale, 05/19/2018,love but a few problems some chronic,pos,"We bought this as a certified used car from a dealer at 9mo old and very low miles.  PROS:  Very comfortable especially for my taller husband, most switches in easy reach, manipulation of back seats very easy, lots of cargo room, peppy engine for larger SUV, grips the road very well.     CONS:  Very noisy cab- lots of road noise and wind noise.  Burnt smell occasionally coming from circulation vents- mechanics have not been able to source it so not fixed over almost 6 years of ownership.  Controls on steering wheel not intuitive.  Climate control difficult and not real efficient.  Of the 2 USB ports, one quit working after a year (front of console).  Biggest and most dangerous issue was an issue with electronics; warning lights would come on, often several, radio lights would come on, engine would speed up and not be under normal control (this was after a year of ownership, still under warranty).  This progressed to multiple attempts to start (warning lights all on and acting like dead battery).  Would get jumps to start, bought a new battery and the car would still be difficult.  Became dangerous to drive so was hauled to dealer by tow truck.  Dealer attempted a repair that was not successful and car died again when out of town.  Dealer tried to fix again and was unsuccessful- could not find issue.  Finally had a relative who was a mechanic tell us about a Honda recall on electrical issues and steering column electronics.  Had dealer do the fix for the Honda issue and this fixed the problem.  Look up related Honda issues for Acura issues.

Was told GPS would be ordered and replaced. Got the run around for 2 months and then, when I asked to talk with the service manager, was told it would not be changed after all.  I talked with headquarters and the response was...we don't make it any better.  Had I had real service from the beginning, I would recommend the car but caution drivers it is wider than most and the gas mileage poor.

acura,mdx,2013,Former Acura Fan, 11/26/2019,Buyer beware. High repair bills ahead,neg,"I bought my MDX for the reliability, thinking I would drive it well into 200,000 miles. Unfortunately, at just over 100,000 miles, the check engine light came on. 10 weeks and $10,000 later, I got my car back with engine rebuilt. Luckily, I found an independent mechanic. I can't imagine how much the dealer would have charged for this repair. The worst part about this is Acura knew about this issue in 2013 and issued a Technical Service Bulletin (web search for: TSB 13-024). They refused to take any ownership in the issue or offset the repair costs in anyway. 

I can not recommend that any one purchase this vehicle or any other Acura for that matter. 

Here's an excerpt from the TSB: ""The cylinder bore may be out of round, causing low compression.
CORRECTIVE ACTION: Inspect the vehicle and, if necessary, replace the engine block.""

Other than MPG, nothing to complain about.
Performance is outstanding for an CUV/SUV.
MDX is actually fun to drive on a winding rural road.

No noted squeaks or rattles.

Had a 2012 RDX and the MDX is far better.

Acura dealers discounting due to coming 2014 model can result in a very attractive deal."
acura,mdx,2013,Ex-Acura Owner, 03/02/2020,Acura - Never Again,neg,"We owned a 2007 MDX which was a great SUV.  Drove it on a trip out west to see the National Parks, 8,000 miles and it never used a drop of oil.  In 2013, we gave it to our son and bought a 2013 MDX.  We thought the last year of a model would be the best, all bugs worked out - wrong.  It consumed oil from the time it left the lot.  We took it to dealers in NC, MD and MA.  They all said that using a qt. in 1,000 miles was acceptable.  We only used it on long trips so a consumption test was difficult to do.  We ended up extending the warranty for 5 yrs. and 70,000 miles.  We knew the engine wasn't reliable long term.  We carried several qts. of oil in the car with disposable funnels and filled it back up when it needed it, usually around 1,000 miles.  We just traded it in with 91,000 miles.  We received the notice of the class action suit against Honda/Acura over the situation and figured we'd never get rid of it once the word spread.  Acura did extend the warranty for the issue but from what we read, it is difficult to get them to work on the engine and even replaced blocks leak oil.  We loved the handling and comfort.  It felt safe.  But, Acura blew it on the engine and they refused to acknowledge the problem promptly and the recourse isn't satisfactory.  Would never consider an Acura again.

acura,mdx,2013,Jon M-, 03/06/2017,Sport Ute that Leans Towards Sport,pos,"So I’ve had this SUV for a little over 2 1/2 years now.  Performance is still terrific.  Been having some issues with front brakes/front end.  Replaced rotors/pads still some front end shake on braking.  Still have vibration that developed about 9 months ago in front end at 75-85 MPH.  Dealer can’t seem to sort it out.  Aside from these issues it’s still a very comfortable vehicle.  I’ve put about 20K on odometer.  Aside from maintenance any other issues have been covered by the CPO warranty.  Gas mileage is terrible unless you baby the throttle, but it’s also a performance SUV.  Some of the trim and the headlights are starting to show some age.  Overall it’s been a great vehicle over the past 2 plus years.  If I can work out the bugs before the CPO Warranty expires I’ll probably hold onto it.  If not might trade in for something larger as our needs have changed since purchased.  Might look into a pre 2018 Expedition EL or Suburban.

Update 9/14/19....  I traded in the MDX.  I now drive a 2019 Ram 1500 Classic crew cab hemi.  I couldn’t get the front end straightened out and it was bugging me.  The ram is actually quieter riding and gets better gas mileage.  Ha!!!  The MDX will still put a smile on your face in the twisties.

acura,mdx,2013,Sean , 11/01/2020,Stunning,pos,"I have owned my 2013 MDX since December of 2012. I have logged over 140k miles.  No complaints.  Phenomenal care.  One time the door actuator wouldnt lock the rear passenger door and I had to lock it manually, but that was an easy and cheap fix.  Tires and oil. I have absolutely no complaint.  Highly recommended cars.  I've convinced my two brothers to get MDX. I would like to see MDX stick to only 4wd, but I assume some dont want it. Newer models Hybrids improve power but not really MPG.  All in all, I recommend but then again I havent owned another car in 8 years, maybe there are better than out there.

acura,mdx,2013,love2drive111, 02/09/2013,Acura MDX Review,pos,"I recently bought a brand new Acura MDX and I am a satisfied customer. The primary reason I purchased this car was that it was a gift for my
mother and I believed it fit her style, a blend of luxury and accomplishment. Driving impressions of this vehicle were satisfying as the ride is very sleek, you can hardly feel a bump on the road. The ride is almost too relaxing as if you were on auto pilot in a commercial aircraft. The vehicle is extremely fun especially in the rain, as its suspension is highly tuned for safety. Seeing other MDX vehicles on the road is definitely an eye catcher because of limited ownership. If you have the means of 50k I highly recommend it.

After 22,000 miles on my 2012 MDX, the best I was able to achieve was 18.6 MPG, so this is a huge improvement. Many of us have seen reviews with significant MPG stated -here's why.
The 2014 has a robust online computer that not only provides total MPG, but per trip MPG as well.
I drove from Central NJ to Newark, Delaware twice last week (78 miles each way, 80% highway, 20% city) and averaged 30.9 and 30.7 MPG on each trip, which is impressive for this type of vehicle."
acura,mdx,2014,tmariner, 03/14/2014,Even better! A keeper!,pos,"Moved up to the 2014 from a 2011 MDX. Looks similar, but big perceptual difference.

I can select the Sport mode and make the MDX handle like the 2011 3.7 liter, but normally luxuriate in the ""normal"" mode with handling and silence. The twin screen dash still befuddles my wife, but as a techie big step up -- and I have the ""base"" model without all the goodies.

Great acceleration, but more silent and refined. Tons of detail improvements to numberous to list.

If you're in the market for an SUV, either step up to or step sideways into this car! I mistakenly leased it -- a reasonable deal, but they will probably have to pry this thing out of my cold, dead hands."

Now waiting for new electrical module to see if it will solve issues. Navigation system not user friendly when trying to set up. Way too many defects for a $50k car.

Complaining since inception #1 Driver's windows rattle lowered a few inches #2 intermittent motor noise from behind dash with recent 3 second**Steering Wheel Lockup**. Dealer duplicated motor noise on 4th visit. Corporate tech advised dealer ""they're aware of ""issue"" with steering motor, but don't have any solution at this time"". Dealer advised car ""normal"" and I should pick it up!! Problem without solution=no repair? What could happen if the steering wheel locks up again?
If you have this problem Please file your complaint immediately with National Highway Safety Administration 888-327-4236. BTW dealer said rattle windows is as per Acura design. Really?
 More than two years into the lease I became aware through a blog that there was a service bulletin sent to all Acura service centers. Neither of the Acura dealers that I visited 10 times to fix the noise alerted me that there was a fix. When I made an appointment to have 10 plastic clips that secure the plastic shroud under the hood I was given a very hard time before they fixed the problem explaining to me that it was not s recall!

acura,mdx,2014,dantl, 01/31/2014,Complete junk!,neg,"My MDX has been in the shop more than I had the car since I bought it 2 months ago.
A handful of owners, including myself, have had issues with the warning lights for various vehicle systems (i.e. lane departure warning, front collision warning, SH-AWD, Traction Control, etc) coming on for no reason and when that occurs, these systems do not work.

The car has been to the dealer 3 times for the same issue and most recently, they only reset the computer and gave me the vehicle back so I can test it out to see if the problem happens again.

This is my 4th and last Acura.
My prior 3 Acura vehicles were reliable and thatÂs why I came back for a 4th one."
acura,mdx,2014,Jim G, 09/06/2016,Still Disappointed With My 2014 MDX,neg,"This is an update to my previous reviews of my 2014 MDX.  I now have 65K miles on my vehicle, but I've never had a vehicle with more problems in my life.  It's a good thing I bought the extended warranty, but it's still a pain to have to deal with constant problems.  In my last review I wrote that I took my vehicle in to fix the stuttering at acceleration and it took two visits before they could diagnose the problem, which was a software bug.  Acura engineering was addressing the bug, so the temporary fix was to replace the transmission fluid, which did work.  However, it's now almost 2 years later and Acura has not completed the software fix, so I had to have the transmission fluid replaced again.  To make things worse, the Acura Service manage told me the MDX transmission is no longer the same as in my model year (and they're changing again), so it's doubtful that this transmission issue will ever be resolved.  Additionally, the vehicle has issues with the steering wheel grinding when it retracts, the trunk release is still intermittent, the navigation system send me to restaurants on the east coast even though I live in California, blah, blah, blah.  I can't wait to get rid of this vehicle, and I'll never buy an Acura or Honda again.

acura,mdx,2014,lbjr51, 07/03/2014,Beware of noise (VCM or modulator?),neu,"This car is comfortable to drive other than the fact that one must put up with an irritating noise that Acura refuses to fix (5 in all categories otherwise). Some have described the noise as being similar to ""a cell phone in vibrate mode going off on a hard surface."" My understanding is the noise is identified as being from the Variable Cylinder Management System (VCM) switching from 3 cylinders to 6 cylinders. Unfortunately, the noise gets louder over time. Acura contends it is the all wheel drive unit modulator activating.
It apparently is also noted on other Honda models like the RDX, Pilot and Odyssey. At the minimum, Acura's dealers should be required to disclose this issue."

Gets loud at >50mph.   I took it in, dealer says it is a known problem for which Acura hasn't put a fix out for.   They didn't want to try putting in rubber tape, etc and start messing with the window fit perhaps making things worse.  Recommended I wait and see if Acura puts out a fix.   Are you kidding me.. $55K for a loud noise in your ear.    Not a sign of quality to compete with rivals.   Stay away.  "

First issue is not necessarily a bad design, but build quality of SUV that is made in America. If this SUV were built better, there would be a lot less complaint and more appraises but unfortunately, it does not represent a premium SUV class at all. Overall cost cutting also shows how much Acura cut material cost to save money in several areas for loyal Acura owners will realize rather quickly. After first three months and 2400 miles later, the ultimate question remains. Will you buy this SUV again? My answer would be ""probably not"" I have owned many Acura but this is the worst. "

Acceleration is smooth and steering feel is excellent...drove the RX too but, MDX sportier handling much more fun...very roomy 2nd seat with new push button slide ...cargo area gives me all I need. Having only 2 option packages from Base forces losing desirable options like heated rear seats, folding rear view mirrors, remote start, parking sensors, better insulation, better leather, etc without paying $8K more for Advance pkg and then you get 16.2 in DVD screen, 22.8 mpg on first tank."

Made an appointment with the purchasing dealer only to have them tell me it needed tires.(21,000 miles) and alignment. Could not find the noises. Said if I came back and purchased a set of new tires $1300.00 they would look at it some more. Talked to Acura about this and they said it was a dealer issue and I would have to take care of it by working it out with the dealer. What happened to my warranty?? No more Acura's for me. Update :  I have attempted to trade this vehicle but cannot reach any kind of fair trade, these MDX do not have good resale value due to the transmission! Problems and rattles.

We have had a lot of winter weather lately and the MDX does great on snow and ice.
We are pleased with fuel economy for a vehicle this large.
This is my wife's car primarily and she drives like she's running from the law - still averaging about 22 mpg in mix of city/highway.
Only complaint is that touchscreen seems difficult to use as compared to simply having a knob or a switch.
But all cars seem to be going the touch screen direction.
Also wish Acura didn't do quite so much bundling of packages.
Would have purchased the tech package but I am not a fan of the navigation system. Overall, very pleased."

During its journey,it had couple of problems:Seesaw noise on engine bay, Squeeky steering wheel, two recalls (seatbelt and driveshaft), rear seatbelt rattle and now lane departure warning, front collision warning and transmission warning....

My first trip on the hightway the MDX averaged 31.4 MPG, no cruise control, I was speeding around 67 to 70 MPH, a long road trip this weekend average city and highway 28 MPG, so I'm happy so far with this. One of the tech parts I most love is the ACC and LKAS, this is basically a self driving car, a small touch to the weel from time to time is the only thing you have to do.

As a semi BMW loyalist, I went to look at the X5 to replace my Suburban and share garage space with my M Roadster and 7 series. The Suburban is too big now that the kids are grown, but the X5 was too small. I then proceeded to drive several of the other luxury SUV's (Lexus, Infinity, Mercedes, and Acura) and the MDX stands out in every category I saw important. It was close to the X5 in handling and better in ride (It blew the others away in both). Acceleration is strong and braking is quick and reliable. 2nd seat leg room rivals the 7 series. With the 3rd seat down, storage is ample and we can take 7 pax if needed."

But, upon returning home, I discovered they also don't include a tire wrench or a jack. Are you kidding me Acura?!! Do you really need to save that extra $1.50 on a $50K LUXURY car?

Powerful engine and good handling but it is loud and the rest is lacking. Computer service lights never stop. The only time I ever actually enjoy the console is the week after I take it for service and get hit for $300 bucks. The other 90% of the time the tire pressure and service lights are constantly on. It reminds me of my printer that never works because it's constantly trying to make you buy new toner instead of just working. Last week and the service tech implied the reason for all the service needed is because the car is almost 2 yrs old. C'mon, it barely has 1200 miles."

acura,mdx,2014,hhhjjj, 02/25/2014,Diappointed and mislead,neu,"We purchased a 2014 Acura MDX 2WD. It has a harsh and noisy ride over bumps. This is due to the light suspension and the light rear end. If you accept more bounce and are indifferent to thumping noises you will be OK. Our dealer suggested riding around with a 50lb bag of dog food to help quieten. Also, notice the resistance when the engine downshifts. Our biggest objection is the Dealer, Gary Force Acura in Brentwood Tennessee, mislead us by putting us in an AWD model for our two test drives. We thought we were buying a much smoother and quiet vehicle. Either way, I would not recommend this vehicle. Based on price you can do much better purchasing another vehicle. "

I have been very satisfied with all of the vehicles except for one area. The tire balance vibration in the 2007 and 2010 Acura drove me crazy.
Everything else worked extremely well.
The vibration caused me to purchase a 2013 Lexus RX 350 which was a quieter and smoother riding although smaller.
We recently checked out a 2014 MDX and were blown away by the improvement in ride and road noise.
The ride is better than the RX, quieter and a substantially better handling vehicle.

They fixed the rattle -- something related to packing and the front right strut.

Stereo issue remains. Sometimes when the iPod is plugged in and I try to change from one playlist to another, it puts up a message: ""Generating voice recognition commands...""

I have to turn the car off to get rid of the message.
Acura has a bulletin about problems occurring when the iPod is not plugged in all the way. I've confirmed my iPod is securely connected."

We have 2 big dogs so there's plenty of room for them and our gear when we head out of town.
We live in the city (SF), so I try
keep the driving in the city to a minimum. Cabin is quiet and ride is smooth. Prefer Sport mode since I like the tighter steering feel similar to my last car.
We keep the 3rd row seats folded down for more room. It's a very roomy cabin and
cargo space. Much more storage than the Toureg and some of the other mid-size we looked at. I'm glad they rounded out the beak since that was always an eye sore for me."

A month ago I was driving home on a rainy afternoon when a small SUV crossed over the media from the opposite side of the road, went airborne, and hit me.  Fortunately, my dog and I were not injured, although the SUV sustained considerable damage.  The airbags did not deploy because the other vehicle hit the passenger side of my windshield and structural support pillar.  Did over $14,000 of damage.  I had no time to react.  Just a large object appearing in my view and impact.  This could have been a much more significant event.

Poor voice command (fewer commands then other vehicles, some commands don't work, etc.), very poor Nav display (not clear, doesn't work with polarized glasses.)
Again, for a vehicle of this size it handles well and is fun to drive.
Good use of interior space.

Nav/Voice/Entertainment very disappointing."
acura,mdx,2014,Tim McCartney, 01/23/2016,Best car I ever owned,pos,"My 2014 MDX WITH TECHNOLOGY replaced my 2006 MDX. This car is much more refined than the 06. Beautiful style, great fit and finish. I added the following options; towing pkg, fog lights, roof rails and cross bars, mud flaps, and rear bumper protector. I felt they added a lot to the style as well as some function. This car is primarily my wife's car. She says it is the most comfortable car she has ever driven or ridden in. Good gas mileage for this class vehicle, however the 91 octane fuel requirement over regular cuts down on any fuel savings. I was concerned about the variable cylinder management system, which Acura used to get the 28 mpg. I was pleasantly surprised, no noticeable delays or lack of power. Most cars of this class get improved gas mileage  via CV or 9 speed transmissions, the 2014 did not. Strangely enough the 2015 model did come with a different tranny, however it did not seem to improve mpg.
The only real gripes are with the navigation and the radio display. The navigation locks you out on many functions while moving (safety) however it is frustrating (when passenger cannot input address or search for points of interest). My VW warns you but allows all functions. The GPS display does not provide the posted speed limit like my $100 Garman portable or my VW Touareg GPS. The radio screen is huge but truncates song/artist info beyond so many characters, go figure.

acura,mdx,2014,David C. Laredo, 09/01/2015,Poor Customer Service - I will NEVER buy another!,neg,"As an owner of an Acura MDX I must express my extreme disappointment with Acura's customer service (and lack thereof!).  The dealer from whom I bought my car lost its contract with Acura.  (This can happen.)  BUT... Acura never contacted me to advise as to where I should take the vehicle for warranty work.  

The nearest Acura dealer is a 2 hour (one way) drive for me, but an certified Honda dealer is only 10 minutes away.

Acura now sent me a recall notice informing me a bolt needs to be replaced.  The Honda dealer tells me they can do the work, but Acura will cover and authorize this work only with prior authorization.  Acura denied authorization, which thus required me to undertake a 4 hour round trip to effect this recall.  Oh... and it took Acura 4 weeks and multiple calls on my part to decide my request to deal with the Honda dealer would be denied.  Never once did Acura return my call.

Oh.  Acura did send me a letter to wish me a ""Happy Anniversary"" in recognition of my Acura Ownership.

Based upon their lack of caring, and lack of responsiveness, I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ACURA!

As a postscript, the Pearl White paint blistered & peeled - and while covered under warranty, this AGAIN forced me to make TWO 4-hour return trips to get the work done.  And now the cover-glass (plastic?) for both headlights has major fogging.  Guess who needs to make another 4-hour return trip to get this done... when my friendly Honda dealership is once again available to do the same a mere 5 minutes from my home.

acura,mdx,2014,bgf18, 02/09/2014,Acura Venza,neu,"Overall, we are seriously disappointed. We made the mistake of trading in our 2011 MDX for a 2014 before we had a chance to live with it. Acura has, unfortunately, transitioned the MDX from being an SUV to a minivan-shaped SUV, much like the Toyota Venza. The vehicle is shorter, fatter, and longer. If you need or want an SUV-shaped minivan, then this is the vehicle for you. Also, if you like navigating touch-screen menus while trying to stay on the road, you'll love the new MDX."
acura,mdx,2014,VP, 09/15/2015,Acura is not worth leasing or buying,neg,"Update:  After driving leased Acura MDX for 3 years, I was very happy to return it to the dealer even before my lease expired.  Not a good car at all.  Eats gas, poor performance, transmission problems.  I am driving Acura RDX now and its not a good car either. THUS, Acura is not a good car, do not waste your money on it!
I leased new Acura MDX in 2014 after driving it for 18 month, I am extremely unsatisfied with its performance.
The engine is lacking in power, the car jumps at 20mph and 40mph points and stoles and shakes, so  speed changes are very palpable inside the car. It also lacks in performance as it’s almost impossible to get the speed to 80mph. There are noises from the front and sides of the car every time the speed is over 40mph and they increase with speed.
Break safety feature works at its own whim and beeps at any time, no matter if there are cars in front or if road is completely deserted. Lane departure feature is unusable, when its on, it beeps all the time and distracts from driving. Multi-view rear camera does not have all necessary angles to maneuver safely in a tight spot, it is too high and not a wide angle.
However, absolutely unacceptable is the way audio system and navigations system work, or more accurately – don’t work.  It’s a shame that car that costs more than some homes do has such a poorly designed and obviously malfunctioning navigation and audio systems.  Navigation gps, if able to find an address at all, which happens 5 out of 10 times, will show you the longest route, if to the correct place at all.  The directions end about 400 ft away from the address and you are left guessing about your final destination all the time. The gps screen is very user unfriendly and when you enter the city it “helps” you by showing you cities that start with the same letters you typed all over the US. Many times it cannot find the street or the house number on the street. Gps cannot be updated without spending additional $200 every year and it is about 10 years behind even on a new car, so any road or development built after 2005 will not be found by this gps.
The good navigation system in the car was one of my main requirements when I was signing a new lease, because I use it for work, and I was assured by dealer that this is the car with best gps in the marketplace.  I am ashamed every day to use it in front of clients because in most cases it will either take me to a different address, cannot find address at all, or directs me to drive 16 miles in a roundabout way when my destination is located 2-3 miles away. The features to find a place by name or by category usually show places that are on the other side of the country. If I am searching for closest coffee shop or gas station, it will usually direct me to KY or NJ, and I am in FL. You cannot find an airport by name or address or any other popular venue by name at all.
Audio system does not work with blackberry phone, it does not transfer contracts, interferes with audio and navigation when linked to a phone, and changes settings automatically without me re-setting the system.  There were so many times when after a phone call I was not able to disconnect, or not able to pick up a call at all, or the panel screen would freeze on the phone disconnect screen and would not switch back to navigation.  Many other features do no work at all, but I have no use for them anyway. When talking on the phone,  navigation sound increase so that you do not hear the person you are talking to. The voice recognition does not work, the voice dial does not work, I stopped using Bluetooth function completely because it interferes more than it was ever useful. So the second main feature why I leased this car is also not working, and creates a danger on the road when I have to hold the phone instead of being able to use a Bluetooth.
Overall, I am completely dissatisfied with the
 car functionality and features. I asked the dealer to help, but if system does not work, it does not work, there is not much the dealer can do.  
I went to a dealer and asked him to exchange my car before expiration of the lease because it makes no sense to be paying over $550 a month for a car with features that don’t work and create problems for me.  I wanted to get out of this lease and switch to Acura RDX without the crazy navigation and audio systems, just a basic car that drives (hopefully).  But I was told that there is no way I can change the car until the end of the lease term. So my understanding of the situation is that car does not hold value and it makes no sense for company to buy it back.  I send a letter to the Acura headquarters, and after a long conversation was told that they cannot help because every dealership is doing their own thing and the dealership only can make a decision to exchange the car.  I advised both the headquarters and the dealership that I will use all available social media to share my experience with Acura.

I found out the hard way that Acura has put in a tire inflator/gel rather than a spare tire.
What should have been a 15 minute tire change turned out into a 5 hours ordeal where Acura wanted me to have the car towed to a dealership because the puncture on my tire was larger than ""nail"" size. 
What would have happened if I was on a road trip with no acura dealership near by because Acura road side service will only tow to an Acura dealership?
If you don't tow to a dealership YOU pay to have it towed.
A car that nearly costs 50K should have a spare tire/donut."
acura,mdx,2014,deannie, 10/06/2013,Handling + Braking + MPG = Great Car,pos,"Wow.
I expected excellent fuel economy, but I did not expect to regularly exceed the mpg rating.
Light throttle at 60-70 mph = 30-32 mpg.
This is HYBRID-LIKE fuel economy!

Make no mistake, handling and braking are crucial to active safety, and this car has it.
It was upsetting, though, to have to opt for the tech pkg in order to get the 19"" wheels/lower profile tires which make tech pkg cars handle and brake marginally better than those non-tech-equipped.

Short people MUST test-drive before buying.
My 5'2"" wife BARELY found a suitable driving position.

Love the side mirrors reverse-tilt feature, but prefer both mirrors tilt down when in reverse, not just one."
acura,mdx,2014,Sam Masri, 08/26/2015,Tech package does not work in Arizona heat,neu,"Brakes disks get damaged from heat, car vibrates when you brake, radiator leak after 30000 miles and Acura refused to fix under warranty saying it was damaged by a small stone hit from the road.  I have news for you, Acura, Arizona is hot, cars radiator should be protected by design, and brake disks  should not heat up and bend from normal driving.

acura,mdx,2014,heather52, 06/29/2013,Front Seat,neu,"If you are vertically challenged this is not the car for you. I test drove the 2013, seat adjusted fine. The 2014 is a whole different story. The front seat does not adjust to where a more petite person like myself can see adequately to drive it. Something to be aware of. My new suv is now my husband's. When ordering in the 2014 I never thought that this would be a factor."
acura,mdx,2014,icern, 06/13/2014,Good SUV but Can be better,pos,"Before i purchased the MDX, i test drove other SUV in or near this 7 seater class. From Explorers, Qx60 and Highlander etc. But it came down to two. The infiniti or the Accura. I went with the MDX. For the reason that it is more enjoyable to drive. Good suspension on minor bumps although the Adv Tech seems to be quiter that the other trims.
It has A good Gas Mileage. I get 22 to 24 MPG Combined with more Bostonian/suburb driving than highway. The Interior does not feel cheap at all. Although the Center console looks outdated. It has pretty cool features like the flood lights and interior lighting are LED's. Safety is also good"
acura,mdx,2014,Bob, 05/17/2018,I expected a Lot!,pos,"When I purchased this vehicle I expected a lot from it .... and l got it! It iss truly a pleassure to drive and economical to own and operate. When Itake to the highway I have a heavy foot so averageing 80 -85 of more mph if normal. And the vehicle rides like I am doing 45 - 50 mph, the ridel is smooth, controled and I average 26+ mpg. In the city I drop down to 21 -23 mpg which is still not bad at all. I have owned the MDX since November of 2013 and with the exception of routine scheduled maintance I have not had to spend a dime on repairs. Another positve is the room and confort of the interior which is very nice when you are on those long trips. The only negative I can ssay about my MDX is wind noise on the highway. But believe me, with all the pluses the MDX offers it is easy to overlook that minor problem. When I think back to the other SUV I test drove before I purchased the MDX I am so glad that I made the decision to go with the Acura.
"
acura,mdx,2014,buchem, 11/10/2013,Unacceptable noises,neg,"Soon after delivery we took a long road trip. Would have been enjoyable with great comfort but trip was ruined by dashboard rattles and intermittent grating noise under light acceleration. After three trips to dealer the dash noises are less but not eliminated and are judged to be ""normal"". Not in $50K car. Worse is the grating noise. Dealer says it is a ""known issue"" with no known cause or solution. I know the 2014 model is a total redesign butt his is just unacceptable. All I can say to potential buyers is avoid this car. Acura is selling cars with a known issue and not currently able to fix them. We are very unhappy customers. "
acura,mdx,2014,David S, 01/21/2016,Nice highway suv,pos,"The mdx drives like a sedan on the highway. Comfortably and very quiet.  Surprisingly good gas mileage for a full size vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2014,mogulz, 08/26/2013,"Better than its predecessor, but not perfect.",pos,"The '14 MDX is a driving experience different from the '13.  In comfort mode, it drives like a Lexus RX300.  In sport mode the suspension and steering tightens up and it drives stiffer than a '13 MDX.  'Normal' mode is a happy medium.  Power is still impressive and smooth especially when you remember it is only 290 horsepower.  Acura claims it is faster than the '13.  Getting in and out of the back seats, including the third row is a breeze.  Mileage is excellent for a vehicle this size.  I'll get at least 26mpg on the highway - maybe 28 on summer blend gas.  Around town has been closer to 18.  My complaints about the car are minor.  Visibility through the C and D pillars is not good.  In fact, since 2013 we have had two minor bumper scuffs with roadside posts that were not seen when backing up.  You really need the back up camera to see what is behind you and the Acura/Honda camera is not great, especially at night.  The technology in the stereo, navigation, bluetooth, etc is impressive, but not intuitive.  I have had to flip through the manual on several occasions to do something I had thought should have been elementary.  Some simple tasks like changing the fan speed require two or three inputs.  I guess a complaint about the '13 was that it had too many buttons and knobs.  This car has two few.  The old system with a simple knob for a specific function was better.   Also, the car deactivates some sophisticated NAV and music features and requires you to use voice commands when driving, which can be MADDENING when the voice recognition misunderstands.  But there are workarounds.  Acura/Honda really needs to update this system.  The new cars appear to have the same two screen system as my 2014 model.  Year seven with the vehicle and there have been two maintenance issues out of warranty.  Spent about $1700 total.  Overall I am still pleased with this purchase, but I would not buy a new MDX unless I was certain the infotainment tech was completely new.
"
acura,mdx,2014,bohlson, 09/04/2013,Great except.....,pos,After driving a Chevy Suburban for 18 years I am loving the smaller car with its handling and better gas mileage. I purchased the MDX over the competitors because of the reputation for reliability and because I found it more comfortable than the other cross overs. My one complaint though is that when I open the sunroof I get the smell of burnt rubber or something that immediately comes in the car. At first I thought it was sucking in exhaust but I think the smell is coming up the windshield and into the car. The dealership said it is the smell of the new engine and that after 4-5K miles it will go away but I am not sure. 2k miles and it still does it. Anyone else experiencing this smell???
acura,mdx,2014,johnra, 08/23/2014,Love my MDX but would hesitate to buy again,pos,"This is a great family car with plenty of room, power, fuel efficiency, safety features, and style.
For these reasons I am very happy with my purchase.
However, there are enough quirks that I would hesitate to buy an MDX again.
There is an odd noise the car makes when shifting from 3 to 6 cylinders; the lumbar adjustments on the front driver seat are too limited; sound quality from the radio is pathetic; and I have heard awful things about the in car nav (thankfully I did not waste my money on this).
All cars have quirks but these are too many for a car in this price range.
I get the sense Acura rushed this out the door - a lesson learned for me in buying the first year of a new model."
acura,mdx,2014,Nan, 10/15/2018,Not as happy with this model,neg,"I purchased the 2014 MDX new and have been the only driver -- just now has a little over 20K miles (the little 'ol lady owner joke :-)  Anyway, I too had the squeal of the steering column whenever the temps were hot or cold.  It took several trips to the dealer (which is a long drive from my home) before the column would make the noise for the service department techs -- service department finally acknowledged they'd had others with the same problem. Now 2 yrs later, steering feels like something is loose and so now back to the dealer I go.  I'm very disappointed in the braking system. The rotors are bad.  It is disappointing I have to have those worked on since the car does not get driven much/brakes aren't used much (no issues with my 2011).  I'm disappointed I cannot use car play because honda won't/can't offer a software update for ""older models"". I don't like the touch screen and the voice recognition works only when it wants to (my 2011 has this same problem), and sometimes the Bluetooth for phone goes crazy and won't recognize my phone.   I purchased this MDX because I own a 2011 MDX and am pleased with it.  It too has low miles. It is used in mountain driving and handles superbly in the snow, down the mountain, etc.  Will keep the 2011 but looking at the Subaru Ascent to replace the 2014 MDX.   I'm sure there are other small issues with the 2014 that I'm not remembering now.  Maybe I just got a lemon.

acura,mdx,2014,flfeds, 06/11/2014,"""CAUTION""---MDX has a driver safety issue! :((",pos,"Just bought the MDX two weeks ago and took it on our first trip and was astonished at an interior design flaw. Heading west on a sunny day produced a significant amount of glare off the aluminum trim around the center console and the entertainment center.It was so distracting and bothersome to the driver that we had to cover the trim with articles of clothing.Dealership was notified their solution was to cover with electrical tape. Acura client relations was contacted their response was thx for feedback, no solution because its the design of the interior for the MDX.No other model has that reflective trim!Stay away,there r
many other competitive choices.I will solve it with ""DUCT TAPE"" :("
acura,mdx,2014,nukem4ever, 05/16/2014,I Don't get all the negatives,pos," (AWD with tech and RES package) I have put 14000 miles on it so far, I drive a lot on highways and I find very little to dislike about it. It is a very quiet car, with a great transmission with perfectly in-tune shifting, it has fairly good acceleration. Sure it is a new model and some folks are going to have bear with the fact that new models will have some issues but those will most likely be ironed out easily. Honda makes excellent engines and the one in this car is no exception, I have driven this car almost daily for about a year and couldn't be happier, but I guess you have to drive it to appreciate how great the ride is"
acura,mdx,2014,Smokejumper, 11/23/2015,Just Dumped it,neg,"This was our third MDX, and the last.  Unfortunately, they got progressively worse.  We had a 2004 that was great for nearly 10 years.  We bought a second in 2007 which was different, but fine.  An accident with the 2007 left it with electrical issues that the Acura dealership couldn't fix after a dozen trips in so we got rid of it.  I immediately bought a 2014 without really looking around - what a mistake.  
-The transmission and breaking are horrible.  
-The navigation system performs less reliably than my iPhone maps app.  
-The voice command system is completely worthless.
-The seats are among the least comfortable I've been in.

Overall, the 2014 MDX would be a disappointment at a price point 10K under what it sells for.  I dumped it after 20K miles.  Goodbye, Acura.

The new MDX is better than the old MDX in every way.
Silky smooth 3.5L V6 with better performance and far better MPG (18/27 AWD. I'm averaging 22 combined). Ultra quiet interior, luxurioius faux-wood and tech savy.
love the adaptive cruise, lane departur warning and crash mitigation.
I lean more towards Tech than pampering in my cars so I'm all in.
Love the touch screen, tablet interface is clearly the way to go.
Ride quality is improved over the last gen MDX.
My only complaint are the seats.
Not as good as 10' TL SHAWD, best seats of any car i've owned.

Update!  6-24-18  Still Love my 2017 RX350 F Sport.   initially bought a GS 350 sedan to replace the MDX but soon realized that we missed an SUV.   Very impressed with the quality and feel of Lexus so we opted for the RX and don't regret it. 

 Seems like if one wants to stay with a Honda product well... the Honda seems to more technologically advanced and is a much better value than Acura in my opinion.

acura,mdx,2014,mike1984, 02/22/2014,Beware,neg,"The 2014 Acura MDX is my third MDX and my last! The build quality and fit and finish was so bad that even after two dealer service visits, many items are still unacceptable. Based on the build quality alone, Acura is no longer a premium car manufacturer. The design and engineering of the technology package is not user friendly and certainly not intuitive. Losing the weather information is a major backward step. The noise from the injectors, the noise from the steering wheel, the noise from the lift cylinder are unacceptable. The dealer says these are ""just the way it is on this vehicle."" I have 3000 miles on this vehicle and I am looking to trade. I am really disappointed in Acura.
UPDATE...I traded this pos in with 4000 miles on it. It remains the worst vehicle I ever owned.

Smooth ride.
Just a great car.
My wife loves it.
(btw, she is 5'2"" and has no problems with the size of this car.) Mileage is around 22 mixed. Not what trip computer says. Love design and layout. Great stereo sound.

Hopefully the quality and reliability will match my expectations in the future, but for now I'm fully satisfied with this MDX.  

I've owned my 2014 Acura MDX for 2 years and am still impressed with the reliability and riding comfort of this vehicle.  I've kept current on all maintenance intervals and the vehicle still feels like it did when I drove it off the dealer's lot.

I've owned my 2014 Acura MDX for over 4 years and continue to enjoy the overall reliability and smooth riding comfort this vehicle offers.

I purchased a new 2014 MDX two weeks ago.
There is a noticeable defect with the rubbber weather strip around the windows of the rear passenger doors. There is a point on the 3 o'clock position of the window seal that bends roughly 30 degrees.
At that point, the seal is popping out.
Looks ugly and water can get inside.


I examined all three 2014 MDXs on the dealership lot, they all had this same issue. Dealership doesn't know how to fix it, and Honda Canada is asking the design engineer in U.S. 

THe 2013 & 2012 MDX have the same 30 degree angle, but no such problem.


I'm asking all affected owners to ask HONDA to fix this."

It has been used for long trips, over 500 mi, short trips, 80 to 100 mi, short trips, 25 to 30 mi, and just around town. Going to golf courses, going to Big Box stores, picking up and toting gardening supplies, flowers, plants, small trees and shrubs. Very adaptable. Very reliable. Very comfortable. Then, a flat tire. Had to replace two original tires, Continentals, with two Firestone tires. Now the vehicle has annoying, maybe serious, vibrations. Firestone has checked their tires, the alignment, etc. Vibrations still occur at 65 to 75 mph. Can the car be blamed for this problem, getting a flat tire? Can the tire manufacturers be blamed? 
Acura dealership serviced the MDX, changed oil, rotated tires, balanced and aligned wheels, and the car travels like brand new. Service at local Firestone shop was the problem. Not too good.

I find using my i-phone more than car's features, because it takes so much time to enter or find any Point of interest from Acura database which is extremely poor or algorithms for searching are poorly designed. Acura owns apology to all owners for this mess and perhaps free update to fix it. It is also very slow in response and user experience requires numerous endless clicks to get to anything. I prefer hands down my GPS in 10 year old Honda Pilot EX than this new Acura. It seems that a lot of owners are furious over this infotainment fiasco. I really want to love this vehicle but in the future I will definitely look more closely at many other brands before buying another Acura.

acura,mdx,2015,CORunner, 08/13/2015,Huge disappointment!,neg,"I have owned my 2015 MDX for about 8 months so far. I have tried to love it, or even like it, but I cannot. I traded in my 2008 MDX after six years of loyal service to “upgrade” to the new model. That was a big mistake.

The 2008 MDX was a great car and I loved it from the day that I bought it. It wasn’t perfect, but it was good at almost everything. The 2015 was a hassle starting on the day I drove it home. It was raining really hard outside, so we did most of the deal looking at the showroom floor model. My mistake. The salesman informed me that all models had parking sensors, fog lights, and Michelin tires and I assumed that he was correct. In fact, he had lied about all three… I got the dealership to agree to swap my tires to Michelins for free (they only come on the top of the line model now). The fog lights and parking sensors were something I should have checked, so I decided to pay for the upgrades myself. Buyer beware. The fog lights went in without issue, but the parking sensors were a joke. When you upgrade, you can only get rear sensors, not front, and they are not the same sensors that are used on the top model. My installed sensors were not flush with the bumper and they did not work. I had to back almost completely into a brick wall to make them start beeping. So a 50% success rate for dealer installed options. Not impressed. Why Acura would dream of building a $50,000 CUV, make it longer, and not include parking sensors as standard is beyond me!

The changes from the 2008 to the 2015, or rather the 2nd generation MDX to the 3rd, were largely not improvements. The power to weight ratio is better on the new car, but acceleration feels anemic in comparison. The suspension is absolutely awful. I had the electromagnetic dampers on my 2008 and it was impressive in the corners! The new model feels far less confident when pushed and my front dampers have developed a constant squeak that causes pedestrians to watch my car as I drive past. The stereo in the old MDX was one of my favorite features and somehow they managed to ruin that on the new model as well. The bass response is weak at best. The touch screen controls are simply awful and make things like adjusting the fan speed for the climate control dangerous while driving. The safety features, like lane departure warning was such a nuisance that I had to disable it. The forward collision warning is dangerous. Mine would go off randomly when I wasn’t near another car! The last thing I want is for my car to slam on the brakes and cause an accident that otherwise would not happen. I spoke with the dealership about the function and was informed that sometimes metal manhole covers or expansion joints will cause the system to produce a false positive. Another safety feature that I had to disable. The materials used inside look and feel cheap. I have a black interior and much of the plastic actually appears to be dark brown. I have had people ask me about it as soon as they get into the car for the first time, so it is noticeable. Finally, the redesign has lowered the height of the vehicle, so while there is a slight increase in cargo space, I’m finding it to be less useable. Oh, I just received my first recall notice…
Acura North America has been useless.

To be fair, there are a few minor improvements. The cabin is generally much quieter, the LED headlights are great, and the gas mileage is better. I was previously getting 14-16 mpg city / 20-22 mpg highway and I am now seeing 19-21 city and 26-28 highway.

If I could go back and undo this deal, I would! My 2008 MDX was superior in almost every way. Build quality has seriously gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's just with the introduction of the 3rd gen MDX or if it's also the assembly line moving from Canada to Alabama. If you are seriously considering a new MDX, I suggest that you take your money elsewhere. I wish I had.

acura,mdx,2015,mdx514, 01/02/2015,Poor visibility in rear,pos,"Overall, I have been very pleased with my 2015 MDX AWD with tech package.  After driving the car for a couple of months, I have become familiar with programming the nav and radio.  My biggest concern with the model is the rear visibility.  When crossing a four lane highway, stopping in the median to continue a left-hand turn, visibility is completely blocked by the rear window brace.  I have experienced this a few times when the car is sitting at an angle and look to the right, you cannot see anything--very scary and dangerous.

acura,mdx,2015,robfrommass, 02/27/2015,Forever an Acura Guy,pos,"Traded in my 04 Acura MDX for a 2014 Chevy Traverse, worst move ever. Bought a 2015 MDX Tech and love it. Much easier to see out of, handles like a car, plenty of power and shifts smoothly with the six speed auto. Dual screen can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of the redundant controls it is actually quite easy to operate with little distraction. LED headlights are second to none. No need to even remove the remote from your pocket, everything is operated through proximity sensors. Third row one touch entry is as easy as it gets. Interior build quality is high but there are a few little flaws. I'm 73"" and wish the drivers seat went back one or two more inches.
Update: Vehicle is now at 47,000 miles.  Needed power tilt steering wheel assenbly replaced under warranty as the electric motors had become very loud. No other repairs needed beyond routine maintenance as of today. There are a few rattles coming from windows when partially open and from the door trim that I wouldn't expect from a luxury brand like Acura, just cheapens the feel of the vehicle. Overall, vehicle has been very reliable and I am still happy with the purchase.

acura,mdx,2015,Christopher, 08/27/2015,7 months into MDX AWD w/ tech - Using everything,pos,"My first MDX.  Owned a TL and a TSX so familiar with the Acura style.   Overall - great SUV.  The most striking thing you will notice 1st is the ride.  Here in N. Texas, very bumpy riding on hard concrete roads that heat crack and leave you wishing for quite & smooth blacktop. The MDX performs extremely well taking a lot of the smashing right out of the ride.   The leather on the seats is the softest I've ever encountered.  Handling is great with the AWD.  Engine power is throaty and responsive.   For improvements, the NAV is crazy.  Found the best way is to just type in the address (good display for such).  Trying to use the voice recognition for NAV is just stupid.  You say,  ""Dallas, TX"" and it says ""Ft. Lauderdale, FL.""  Whatever.  Also stupid is that the NAV system locks (most features) while driving.  Come on!  Hey Acura, there is a passenger who can NAV while driving!    Any new car with a lot of features will eventually make you reach to understand the system instead of being intuitive.  The NAV takes time.  Once you have the address in, the NAV works great. Storage is good so long as the 3rd seats are not used.  Using the seats leaves you with a small space left.  Also, these 3rd-row seats are kid seats as grown ups will have a difficult time getting to them and being comfortable.  I've had luck with the quality- no issues.  Got a recall notice for the bolt on the compressor for AC.  Easy fix they say.  Dealership experience is great.  Give you a free Acura loaner if your request.   This is my wife's car and she loves it for herself and our daughter.   In fact, my daughter always wants to take the MDX over my car.

acura,mdx,2015,Gordon F, 02/11/2017,"Looking for Luxury, just can't find it in the MDX.",neg,"We chose the Acura MDX based largely on positive online reviews from car journals and magazines.  I suppose we should've read actual owner reviews.  The model appealed to us largely due to its advertised ""luxury"", and its size (with third-row seating) was a good match for our family of five.  At $50,400, our SH-AWD model with Tech Package was certainly priced in the premium segment over the Honda Pilot on which it's based on.  Unfortunately, as time went on, we grew to like the vehicle less and less.  Amongst our major complains are the lack of luxury.  This car simply does not feel luxurious.  The windows (all four of them), when lowered even slightly, rattle uncontrollably.  There is literally a half-inch of play.  Acura dealer says this is normal.  We don't think it is.  The rattle is not only VERY audible and annoying, but it doesn't befit a $50k luxury SUV.  Second, the overall interior feels cheap.  Many parts are not aligned correctly, the materials feel like they were made by the lowest bidder.  For example, our steering column cover has a huge gap in it.  The pieces were clearly not correctly attached at the factory.  When I brought this up with the dealer, he blamed me for breaking them and quoted me a price to replace it.  Which brings me to my other major disappointment.  Service.  They do not treat their customers like valued luxury-brand car owners.  They're more interested in constantly selling their high-margin services (ATF Fluid change, cabin filter, etc.), rather than addressing known issues.  Our local Acura dealer is consistently cold-calling us, trying to sell us ""specials"".  All this, despite the fact that Acura corporate tells me I do not need any service that is not displayed on the dash board.  We're not due for an ATF Fluid change until 20k-40k miles.  Our dealer said it was dirty and had to be changed at just 8k miles!   The power liftgate has been to service three times now.  Each time they claim to fix it, it breaks a day later.  I don't even bother taking it in anymore.  But reliability isn't a major issue for us.  The car has been relatively low-maintenance.  It's the little things that ultimately add-up to a less-than expected experience.  The infotainment system for example.  I'd expect it to be a little better.  We own a 2015 VW GTI (for which we paid roughly half the price - $25k), yet the infotainment has a beautiful, fluid interface.  It's fast, responsive, and does what you need it to do.  The infotainment on our Acura MDX has an interface as if it were designed by a first-year graphic design student.  They really aimed for the bare minimum.  It's also slow and unresponsive.  Changing functions or settings often results in a 2-3 second lag.  Why not use an updated processor?  The premium ELS Audio (as Acura calls it), is also, sadly, a joke.  It simply sounds horrible.  I don't have many cars to compare it to other than our 2015 VW GTI, whose premium ""Fender"" audio system is simply generations ahead of the one in our MDX.   We're frankly just not that impressed at this, supposedly ""luxurious"" vehicle.  It feels anything but, with a lot of the interior pieces feeling loose, being misaligned, and a the rattling windows and doors feel like they'll fall apart.  I was quite optimistic about the vehicle when we first leased it, but over the past two years I've grown to really dislike it.  We can't wait for our lease to be up next year.

acura,mdx,2015,jesseg2, 06/14/2015,GPS and Bluetooth are unsable- get a base model,pos,"I have had my tech package MDX for over 6 months now and can confidently say that a $100 tomtom GPS beats the in-dash hands down. 
Boot time takes about 60 seconds. Sluggish input. Passenger cannot input an address while moving. score 0 of 10.

The Bluetooth phone is horrible. People ask if I have the windows down or if they are on speaker phone. My $100 Plantronics voyager works perfectly. Also can't press any digits on touchscreen when vehicle is moving. But can use the iPhone to press # for conference calls, etc. 0/10

Save your money and get the base MDX. 

I do love the ride and 28mpg highway that I average. Probably the most comfortable front seats on any SUV out there. 10/10

After owning for 3 years, not a single issue and they treat me well at Acura of Troy. 10/10

acura,mdx,2015,Bizle, 04/21/2018,Beware of rear suspension clunk/thumping,pos,"Bought a 2015 MDX w/ 33,000 miles on it last weekend.   Noticed a clunking sound from rear suspension right away, mainly only at slow speeds on rough pavement, however very noticeable.  I just dropped it back off at dealer last night.  I was just told they need to replace the rear dampers as they are faulty.   I have had a really good experience with dealer and am confident they will take care of it.  Just want to raise awareness for any potential buyers of used 2014-2016 MDX.  I was unaware when I bought the vehicle-acura is aware of the problem and issued a service bulletin 16-035 in a July 2016.

acura,mdx,2015,woodsfortysix, 03/28/2015,Very quiet - drives like a car...,pos,"Our last Acura was in 2005 - an RL.  Probably one of the best autos we have ever had.  Customer service was excellent.
Since then, several SUVs (another manufacture) and a van for family vacations.  
We purchased this car about three weeks ago, and just returned from a 1,000 spring break trip with our two grandsons.  Car worked great!  Very comfortable - handled quite well on the interstate.  "
acura,mdx,2015,Carrie Shaheen, 04/02/2015,beware the 19 in wheels,pos,"very happy with my new MDX with 2 exceptions, one serious, the other just annoying.  the serious issue, the  19 in wheels are a huge problem if you need to replace a tire anywhere but a large city.  NO ONE carries the 19 in tires.  i had a flat in Lake City, Fl.  My choices Macon or Tpa.   200 miles in either direction.  2 closer Acura dealers did not carry the tire.  200 mi on a donut is too much.  worse yet the  dealer says a full size spare won't fit.  Until these tires become more available I'd stay away from them.  The annoying issue:  the voice controls for navigation, radio etc are just flat hilarious.  Call home pretty routinely either adjusts my AC or finds the closest drug store.  "
acura,mdx,2015,tspring1, 12/31/2014,Very Pleased with my Choice!,pos,"After being an American car guy for years, I bought my first Honda ten years ago and have since owned three.  Honda's are rock solid and other that gas and routine maintenance, I've never had any other problems.

I am at a point in my life where I am looking to move to the next level and considered Lexus and Infinity, but given my history with Honda I looked at the Acura's.  I bought a black on black MDX with all the bells and whistles and while I have only had my new MDX for a few days, I am in love.  For being an SUV it drives more like a sedan and it's very agile.  The interior is top notch and the car rides extremely quiet.  It's still very early but I am very pleased with the quality."
acura,mdx,2015,SteveLo33, 07/19/2016,2015 MDX Tech Package- AWESOME!,pos,"My wife and I have owned several SUV's both large and small and when looking to replace a GMC Acadia we were having a tough time finding a small SUV with a 3rd row seat that had all the features and benefits of the Acadia.  After looking at many different manufacturers and not wanting to go back to a GM product due to repair and breakdown issues we settled on the Audi and the Acura.  Looking at and test driving both vehicles we both felt the Acura was more comfortable, offered better visibility and had a nicer interior.  We went with it and the MDX has been fantastic.  Definitely a 5 Star ***** vehicle.  Performance, handling and overall satisfaction could not be higher.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Florida buyer, 09/11/2018,Disappointed with ride,neu,"Test drove many MDX that seemed great. Bought a different one that seemed a little bumpy on test drive but not super noticeable. 6 months later and after having dealer change shocks and factory recall dampers in rear it still handles road bumps terrible. Hear thud and clunking and makes you cringe with every bump. Its like it has no shocks when it hits bumps and potholes. Transmission hunts at certain speeds and RPM becomes jerky. Highway ride on smooth pavement is very good. Changes the driver seat position from 1 to 2 at random. Good interior space, seating, and interior arrangement. Overall its not the dream MDX we thought it was. Other years ride better from what we understand. But this 2015 is very bad and we have to get rid of it now so we dont have to deal with the bumps for 6 years.
"
acura,mdx,2015,johnnymac_ak, 03/04/2015,Very good vehicle ***UPDATED***UPDATED AGAIN***,pos,"Owned the car for about two months now. Purchased in Oregon and drove the AlCan highway up to Alaska in Feb. to where I live.  This vehicle handled every bit of snow & ice thrown at it. I drove 2400+ miles, for 3+ days on glaze slick roads & never felt a slip. Very comfortable & lots of room.  It drives much smaller than it is.  The LED lights are very crisp & reach pretty far.  The infotainment system is definitely something you have to get used to.  It does so many things & is extremely complex so initially it was a little overwhelming, but after a few hours of seat time, things are getting easier now.  I drove the RX450 Hybrid, Audi Q5 & Q7, VW Touareg & Pathfinder & the MDX won us. I recommend it.  

*** UPDATE***
Been about three years now and I'm still pretty excited about driving the MDX every time I walk towards it with the key in my pocket....  It's our vehicle of choice when it's icy or snowy outside as it handles most everything Alaska has thrown at it with ease.  The SH-AWD is amazing.  I'm still not very good at using some of the tech that's installed.  The voice command systems is a bit sketchy.  It misinterprets my commands quite often, although I've used others and have had similar results with others, so I think the technology industry wide is still getting up to speed.  There are a couple of bugs I've noticed in the electronic system, like heated seats won't work after I've auto-started it twice, but nothing that would change my mind about owning it.  We can load quite a bit of cargo in it so long trips and stops at Home Depot work well, and if I keep my foot out of the ""go fast"" pedal, we get in the lower 20mpg's combined.  All in all, I am still very happy with our choice and knowing what I know now, I'd do it exactly the same again.

***UPDATED AGAIN***
Four years in now and still very happy with the car.  Haven't had any maintenance or failures out of the norm.  I'm a little surprised at the drop in resale value however.  I would have figured that being an Acura, it would have held it's value better.  According to Edmunds and other valuation sites, this vehicle has lost about 45% of its original value.  We have purchased a new Ram 1500 (Laramie - completely optioned out) in the last 6 months and although the excitement of driving a new vehicle is there, and the Ram has many creature comforts, the MDX is still our favorite vehicle for longer trips as it handles better, is more comfortable and is just all around a much safer vehicle.  As stated before (and even with my new truck) the voice recognition software that is designed to make things safer is entirely frustrating and it is simply easier (at least for me) to pull over and do it all by hand like I used to.
*** 5th Year UPDATE***
Still happy overall.  Still hate the voice recognition software.  Still not happy about the resale value.  Still have less than 30k miles on it but it seems that the MPG's are getting better.  Still our go-to car for trips.  I recommend it totally if you're looking for a few year old car that is a great machine.

acura,mdx,2015,karhill1, 12/17/2014,Great Vehicle at a Reasonable Price,pos,"Have had a 2015 MDX, AWD with Tech for a while.  Previously had a prior generation MDX.  The differences are noticeable.  The 2015 is far more luxurious.

The vehicle is solid, extremely quiet, and fun to drive.  The interior design and materials are top notch.

So far not a single negative thought about the vehicle. Performance has been exactly as promised."
acura,mdx,2015,jeff, 07/26/2016,Acura flagship model dropped the flag,neg,"My 3rd Acura in the last 25 years. 1st was a 94 Legend - was a great car. Next was a TL - not so great. This MDX will be my last. Owned for 16 months and driven 13000 miles. Excessive road noise. Driving on rough roads difficult to carry on conversation with person in the middle seat. My 2 year old grandson can draw a better picture than the back up camera gives. It is totally worthless. Navigation is extremely poor - use your phone. Complained about issues at each service appointment but all I get is that will tightened this or that and see how it is until next time. Other words, kicking the can down the road till warranty is out. I did go visit local BMW dealer this past week - anyone want to buy a slightly used MDX?

12-1-16  Update - Traded the MDX for a X5 demo car. Took a $10K loss in the MDX but it was still the best move I could make. I am done with Acura.
"
acura,mdx,2015,JDC NJ, 06/28/2016,No longer a premium vehicle or ownership experienc,neg,"This is one of the worst vehicles we've ever owned and has been rife with significant quality issues almost since we picked it up. For reference, these include:      Body panels were missing attachment clips when car was delivered, quarter panel and bumper came loose. Multiple electrical issues including a bad alternator that dealer took 3 visits to diagnose. Satellite radio failed. Braking became uneven in the first year, dealer refused to address (in tolerance), now needs a brake job after <30k, abnormal tire wear, white paint comes off of car with the most minor contact (paint is thinner to save weight, per dealer), transmission shifts oddly with a great deal of engine noise (within tolerance). Aside from the quality issues, the electronics are poorly executed and difficult to use. You need to read the manual to learn how to change a radio station...and don't dare try to change audio or climate control while you are driving, its is so complicated as to be genuinely dangerous. I just had a great call with Acura customer service where I was told that I should bring the car back to the dealer and discuss all of these issues, again, with no support from Acura. This was once a great brand that produced great products, the MDX should really be out of the premium SUV category and reviewed against Hyundai, GM, Ford, and Toyota, it is premium to those products only in terms of price.

acura,mdx,2015,aparichithan, 12/18/2014,2015 MDX with Tech,neu,"I recently purchased a brand new MDX-Tech. Its a good car in many respect for a middle class family like me who can at most shell some 45k towards a 7 seater. But ACURA being a so called luxury brand, I would expect them to use some reasonably good plastic inside. My car seat hinge cover broke apart in one pull... that did not speak about the quality."
acura,mdx,2015,avv, 06/03/2015,Thermometer/AC problem,pos,"I haven't seen anybody else mention this, but it's probably my only problem with the car since I bought it last December. If I drive the car awhile, and then park it for an hour or so, the next time I take it out, the car thermometer will read about 10C to 14C degrees higher than what it should be. As a result, the AC will then blow full blast for about 5-10 minutes until the thermometer gradually adjusts itself to the correct temperature as I drive around. For instance, it could be about 17C degrees out, but when I take the car out later, the temperature might read about 29C degrees for a little while. If it stay less than 1h there is no problem at all."
acura,mdx,2015,bhuddle, 01/13/2015,My last Acura,neu,"I have owned several Acura products over the years.  I traded a 2011 MDX for this new model.  I can't believe how much they have cheapened up the new model.  The seats are very uncomfortable, covered with low grade leather.  The HD screen of the previous model has been replaced with two sub par displays.  The infotainment offering is horrible, unintuitive, hard to navigate.  It doesn't even have tailpipes, replaced with faux lookalikes.  I have to take the key fob out of my pocket and hold it up to the handle to unlock.  Overall, a very unsatisfactory vehicle."
acura,mdx,2015,emwhydee, 06/20/2015,I want to love this SUV but too many negatives,neu,"I live in AZ and have had this vehicle for 14 months and whenever the temps rise above 90 degrees and the car is parked in the sun the LKAS and LDW do not work.  I get a message that the camera is too hot.  10-15 minutes later, the cameras start working but by that time I am already home.  I purchased this car because of these safety features but did not realize they would not work.  What a waste.  The voice activated navigation system is equally poor and does not recognize addresses or place names so it is another lost cause.  I do not recommend buying this car for these features.
On the plus side, the SUV is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned.  The seat hugs you, the ride is quiet and it is easy to drive.  This is why I want to love this SUV but the negatives outweigh these positives.  I purchased a high end vehicle specifically for these safety features and when they don't work, I end up hating the car all over again.  I will not buy or lease an Acura again.

Because of the over design and value of this vehicle, two years down the road we (my wife and I) traded in our RDX, which was great, for the 2015 MDX. Fell in love with the vehicle immediately, BUT not a minute longer of driving off the lot, we started to discover little things that the quality of this vehicle is REALLY lacking. Loud adjustable seat motors, scraping noise coming from the steering wheel louder, louder then normal engine, a paint job gone bad, bad outside temperature gauge and the list goes on! Acura what have you done?"

acura,mdx,2015,Tanner, 08/01/2015,It's on the inside what matter,neu,"The 2015 Acura MDX is not a ""flashy"" car to the normal eye but certainly does hold its own against other luxury SUV. Handling is very light but easy to get used to. The interior is where the MDX shines, materials are very nice inside and easily accessible however having the tech package you certainly must be good with today's technology because at certain points it can feel overwhelming. Road quality if very nice as well, having owned the Audi Q7 it is very comparable. However only having 15,000 miles I cannot touch base on reliability quite yet."
acura,mdx,2015,Patty S, 11/21/2016,Not so great,neu,"OK, was expecting much more for 50 grand. Biggest disappointment is nav-still use my phone, yet paid big bucks for what I thought would be luxurious, it is cumbersome & unuseful- never never use, sad technology. Radio reception can be shaky, connection light goes in & out(including volumn)-I live in metro area & should be clear as a bell. I am frustrated because what I read was so stellar on the MDX, car of the year. I realize I am fussy but I thought I was paying for that. Not so. Also don't like I can not have digital speedometer, only old school dash-not sure what happened here but I am wanted high end luxury, you can't even tell what kind of car it is from the side. I literally was confused when I first bought this car- is it too much to ask to put ACURA or MDX on the side of a car--CARS LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE FROM THE SIDE- WHITE SUV---MAKE IT SPECIAL--DUUH. Do not feel special in the least driving this car, what has happened to that's a cool looking car. Bottom line I would not have spent the extra money on an acura, it's not that great. Unfortunately, this is my dream car for a long time. What I like is the engine it does have power, but- the keyless entry is defective too- at times I have to find the fob to lock or unlock-perfection has not been found in the 2015 MDX in my opinion, what's better? that verdict is out

acura,mdx,2015,Jerry, 01/20/2016,Strange and dangerous downshift.,neu,"Be careful with the strange sudden acceleration when braking. Shifts into lower gear and lurches forward when applying break.

Both vehicles recommended using 91 octane or higher.  I faithfully do.  However, and unfortunately, I used to have weather information available in my 2011 with the tech package, which no longer is available without now paying for it.  Honestly, the vehicle costs enough already without add-on expenses.  Also, occasionally and without reason, the brake warning flashes.  I've asked about it at the dealership, but no one there seems to know anything about it or has heard of other owners citing it.  Apparently, no recalls are associated with this . . . yet.  Recently, my battery failed.  it was only 2.5 years old.  Generally, they should last 5 years, or so I'm told.  At any rate it was a Japanese battery that had a bulge in one side when it was replaced.  Not sure what that means, but it would not have been good for the engine compartment had it exploded.  Finally, the GPS is poor.  Honestly, a smart phone with a GPS app is far better.  I will likely buy another MDX in a couple of years, but will look to see if these deficiencies have been corrected.  The MDX is still likely one of the best in its class.  Added comment (9/2019): Recently, I have experienced a problem with the locking/unlocking mechanism.  It seems to happen after the vehicle is washed.  I took it to the dealership, but they could not replicate the problem, so it remains a mystery.  Overall, the MDX is a good vehicle, as it is approaching 100,000 miles, but will now look at other SUVs when it is time to replace it since the new MDXs have smaller cargo areas and an annoying engine cutoff when idling.

acura,mdx,2015,Karl, 04/18/2018,Not your Japan Acura,neu,"Now that the MDX is built in Alabama, the fit and finish is no better than my old Ram pickup.  The transmission is jerky and the brake assist likes to come on whenever it feels like it.  Nav, phone, and infotainment setup and use is totally overdone and complicated.  I can't really blame the problems on Alabama, but this is not the MDX you're used to.

acura,mdx,2015,GRJ, 03/01/2020,Nice and Fast,pos,"We purchased a 2015 Tech FWD model in the Fall of 2014 and despite negative reviews I've since read, have had no problems at all.  I take it in religiously every 5000 miles for the oil change / tire rotation and whatever else is required all at the dealer.  I have a lifetime alignment package from Firestone so a couple of times a year I take it over to be sure all is well as far as alignment is concerned.  There have been a couple of recalls handled by Acura but our MDX so far has been unaffected by the notifications.  I like it because it's quick, comfortable, especially for passengers in the second row (never used the third row) and has decent cargo space.  The negatives would be the actual amount of space for cargo (would like more) and the Acura/Honda info system is weird and not easy to use at all.  This is our second MDX the first being a 2011 and what sold me is that you can use regular fuel in this model (although they suggest premium) and the mileage is great 23/28.  Five years and no engine performance issues at all on regular.  Since it was expensive to purchase, I plan to drive this one for a few more years.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Lee Nalley, 08/09/2015,My first step up.,neg,"I have had my MDX for 10 months now and have several problems that cannot be explained:  The indicators for blind side vehicles will go off when no one is by them; the gas cap light will go off when nothing is wrong; the front breaking light will go off when there is nothing in front of me; and the windshield wipers will go off when it is nice and bright and sunny.  I'm told at the service area that they can't find anything wrong and cannot pinpoint the problem, but will keep checking the their update sheets and if anything comes across, they will let me know.  This is a safety issue as far as I'm concerned as the breaking light comes on, my reaction is put the breaks on.
Also, have a problem with the windows being down at high speeds, the tailgate wants to try to pop open, you can see gaps appear along the sides.  Again the service agent cannot find anything wrong.
I have the heated seats and it feels as if they were never turned off, making it a little uncomfortable during the summer months.
The interior is comfortable, but with a lot of road noise; handling is good and acceleration is really good.
I am sorry that I spent what I did for this car.

I have since traded my 2015 Acura for a 2016 GMC Acadia and am much happier with the overall performance and handling.

The car was towed to the dealership, we were assured it was a battery problem. We were given a new battery and left for a trip. We then drove it several hours, parked it overnight, and received the same messages the next day when we tried to start the car.
Another tow, another dealership in a new state.
Two weeks later, and we don't have the car back yet. Acura Client Services has been really unhelpful. I would not recommend this car to anyone. "

Suddenly, all my systems were not functioning and the computer was warning about no all wheel drive, no power steering, no LDW, etc. So, I used roadside assistance and scheduled an 830am appointment on Saturday morning to pick up my car and have it towed to the Brooklyn Acura dealer. At 9am, I was told they would tow the car at 940am. At 10am, I was told 11am. Finally, I had a tow at 11am. "

When the time arrives to buy another vehicle, I will look at another MDX, but will check to see if these deficiencies have been corrected.  Despite these nit picks, the MDX is still likely one of the best in its class, and it is very stylish.  That styling has been copied by other manufacturers.

I read another customer's review which stated he was having issues with the ""adaptable transmission"".  The transmission in my MDX is also rough with gear changes. I took the car in to the dealership numerous times to ""fix"" the problem before one of the service workers told me that it was just the way the car drives!
I am also having problems with the driver door not unlocking.  Most of the time I am able to get in the car but intermittently I cannot get in the driver door but I am able to open all of the passenger doors.  Has anyone had issues with lock outs?  Even though my car is still under warranty the dealership will not fix it because they cannot get it to duplicate the issue.  I even sent the dealership service manager a video of one of the lockouts clearly showing the key fob in my hand and not being able to open the driver side door but able to open the passenger door. Acura will still not fix the issue.
Also, the inside of all of the doors and lift gate have dark discoloration that cannot be cleaned off.  I've never had this happen to any cars that I have owned.  Anyone have issues with discoloration inside the doors?

Id owned an old TL that I loved and was hoping to have the same romance with an MDX. I took it to a third party mechanic the day after I bought it and he said it looked clean. A week after that inspection, while driving at low speed on my suburban neighborhood street the front suspension started to make rather loud thunks and creaks as if something was loose or a tire was about to break off. At higher speeds the problem disappeared. A week later on the way to Costco two blocks from our house my wife turned to me and said, “you need to take this car to the dealership and get it looked at.” I did.

I have all the dealership record to show I have taken the car to the dealer multiple times or same issue. Because of absolutely pathetic customer service I will never go near Acura or Honda product.

This is my second MDX (my wife's car) and while I am big fan of the vehicle, Acura made some horrible tweaks to the car.  If I were to buy this car again, I would try to find a 2015 model.

Pros:  The interior is beautiful with great materials.  The ride quality is excellent and always gives confidence.

Cons: The are 3 man issues with this car
1) The transmission is truly horrible.  I am car guy who has owned many cars and have never experienced such a bad transmission.  PLEASE release a software update to fix this

acura,mdx,2016,Very Disappointed, 11/28/2015,2016 MDX Vibration Part II,neg,"Very disappointed, follow up to my previous post, ok my car has been at the dealers 6 times now for a vibration between 55 to 75 MPH 4,900 miles they keep saying they have to confirm the vibration which I have a service order from October stating they confirmed the vibration, they replaced the brake rotors, needless to say vibration still there, they replaced the tires, vibration still there, took it back to the dealer today for 6th time, another test drive with the service manager he said he could feel something but wasn't sure what it was, back seat was vibrating extensively, service manager acknowledged it, said he would take a new MDX off the lot drive it same route we drove mine to see if the road made it vibrate. They called and said they test drove a new MDX off the lot and it vibrates worse than mine so it's a characteristic of the vehicle. They actually put this in writing on the service order. I asked if they were informing consumers of this vibration characteristic when they were looking at the vehicles and they said no, I told them just because the other car vibrates does not make it right, it sounds like a design defect to me, this  directive came from the District Service Manager I cannot believe they would actually think that is acceptable, they all vibrate so that makes it acceptable???? Buyer beware I would not buy the 2016 Acura MDX."
acura,mdx,2016,G. Adams, 07/28/2015,"Great, responsive car. Terrible interface.",pos,"Before buying, I test drove a 2016 Pilot EX-L and a 2015 MDX. In my opinion, the MDX felt more agile and responsive than the Pilot, and I preferred the MDX's interior and exterior styling over the Pilot. 

The Good:
Car handles incredibly well. Accelerates, turns, and brakes superbly. If you're looking for a three-row SUV, I can't think of anything that would come even close to the same level of performance and value, except perhaps a Pilot. The only other option I considered was the Volvo XC90, but it would cost around 25-30% more, and although I greatly prefer the Volvo's interior and user interface, my friends with Volvos have had issues with reliability. Audi Q7 also looks great, but again price and reliability issues steered me away. So, from a price-performance-reliability standard, the MDX is very hard to beat. I took the MDX on a curvy, secluded mountain highway, and it was truly the most thrilling drive I've ever had. I'm happy with the car.

The Bad:
The user interface is disgraceful. Acura's worst yet, and that's saying something. Even though the dealer set up the car for my wife and me, my wife's first solo drive in the car had  her near tears because of the maddening user interface. For instance, getting the car to accept her phone's bluetooth connection instead of mine was crazy complex, and you have to go through two entirely separate menus if you want to transfer both the phone operations and the phone's media (e.g., Pandora) from one source to another.  Even everyday tasks like turning on the seat's heaters, adjusting the A/C, or tinkering with the audio settings (e.g., fade/balance) all take multiple levels of menus, requiring too much of the driver's focus and attention. I sorely miss when I could do any of those things with a single gesture (flip a switch! turn a dial!) without having to take my eyes off the road. Now, I have to find the 1 cm square on the display panel that takes me to the menu to adjust the fan. Then the menu changes, and I have to navigate my hand to the ""+"" and ""-"" icons. Even when I know what to do -- which isn't often the case, because the menu system is poorly laid out -- my eyes leave the road for what'd I guess to be about three seconds... just to adjust the fan! 

Speaking of user interfaces, the displays in the car are terrible. Just plain old washed out and ""fuzzy."" I'm wondering if Acura got a deal on surplus parts from circa 2001. Backup camera quality feels like it's made from Soviet-era parts, and the touchpad was probably made from leftover Microsoft Zune panels. Resolution and clarity are shameful. 

Other annoyances:
The glove compartment light apparently only comes on if the headlights are on. I, personally, tend to open the glove compartment when the engine is off, and even if it's light outside, the back of my glove compartment is still pretty dark.

The chrome trim used all over the center stack reflects the sun like a mirror, creating an annoying and blinding distraction. My wife and I each experienced this independently, so I don't think I'm being nit-picky. Look for a recall on this in future months, where your dealer installs non-reflective stickers over the chrome trim to solve this safety issue. ;-)   

With Acura's button-based transmission system, it seems impossible to park the car, turn off the engine, and keep the radio on. There's a ridiculous ""car wash"" mode that lets you turn off the car and keep it in neutral, but good luck remembering the proper sequence of brake, button, and transmission to put it in this mode, and I'm still not sure how practical this mode is anyway. 

Suspension is... bumpy if not jarring. 

Too much hard plastic.

Acura dealer mentioned crazy expensive parts when trying to upsell on warranty. Do headlights really cost $1,100!?

Notes on AcuraWatch Plus:
AcuraWatch plus is a suite of features like adaptive cruise control and lane keep
 assist. Unfortunately, it does not include blind spot monitoring. I had great hopes for both adaptive cruise and lane keep assist, but neither seem quite ready for prime time. Adaptive cruise is a little too slow to react, especially when speeding back up either when the car in front accelerates or when you change lanes to go around a slower car. Lane keep assist is at times too aggressive while at other times too oblivious of the car's drifting across lanes.  It also seems to continually ""test"" if the driver is actively steering by subtly turning the wheel slightly back and forth. After a couple of hours of driving, my arms and shoulders were sore from subconsciously fighting these small, constant tugs on the steering wheel. On the other hand, I have had at least one successful driving experience where I let the car do most of the steering while I barely assisted. That was kind of fun, but I don't foresee those opportunities arising often, due to typical traffic and road conditions.

Overall: Great car, terrible tech.

acura,mdx,2016,Glen Tryer, 07/13/2015,Wife's 2016 Acura MDX with SH-AWD Advance,pos,"We looked at numerous SUVs and Sedans but kept coming back to the Acura MDX.  Build quality, fit & finish, ride comfort, interior materials, driving performance and styling were equaled only by several of the other Japanese auto makers.  Acura was the only one with a dealership nearby so it wouldn't be a hardship if the MDX does have problems in the future.  This is our fourth Acura so we do have some degree of owner loyalty.  Both of these factors weighed heavily in our decision on which SUV to purchase.

However, there are several things that we do not care for and they are as follows,  the automatic stop/start feature is a nuisance (and it cannot be disabled), navigation system and driver / vehicle interface is cumbersome  and complex.  You're better off just learning to use the voice prompt for most commands.  I prefer the Bluetooth connectivity in my 2011 Ford truck than the Acura phone system.  My wife has learned to use Siri on her linked IPhone to make calls from the MDX's Bluetooth connection (it's easier than their system, at least in her opinion).

We drove both the two wheel drive and SH-AWD versions and I can say for a fact that the AWD option handles and performs MUCH better in a hard rain.  We typically don't have any snow or Ice in this part of Texas but my guess is that the AWD would do just as well in those driving conditions too.  Another consideration is that when the SH-AWD option ($2000) is purchased, you also get a spare tire and jack.  If you buy these items separately from the dealer they are $510.  The two wheel MDX drive DOES NOT COME with a spare tire. The multiple versions of ride control (e.g. IDS, Comfort, Normal, Sport) are wasted on us.  Why would anyone want to drive a glorified station wagon in Sport Mode, the MDX is not a sports car!  Acura could get away from having to install the VERY expensive magnetic shock absorbers currently in use but I suppose if that's what the competition is doing they have to do it too.

Transmission, shift points, smoothness, etc. all seem to be set OK for normal to moderately aggressive driving.  We really like the transmission push buttons in lieu of a ""gear shift lever"" sticking up in the middle of the console.  The MDX has paddle shifters, if you have the need to shift manually but I doubt we'll ever use them.

The engine is strong, quiet and idles smoothly.  Our overall fuel economy has been in line with Acura's posted claims for miles per gallon but I sure wish they could have figured out how to do it on Regular (87 octane) fuel.

Wheels and tires on the Advance model are good looking 19"" wheels w/ Michelin rubber, but I saw several of the basic MDX two wheel drive vehicles equipped with Hankook tires.  They would not be my first choice of tires on a $40K vehicle.

Warranty is comparable to Lexus and Infiniti, I cannot understand why the Europeans (especially the Germans cannot seem to keep up with their competition in this category).  As of this writing, we have not purchased an extended warranty on this vehicle and I doubt that we will.  After all, Acura and Honda's claim to fame is their remarkable reliability and dependably so those features should be designed and built into the vehicle. I wish we had more mileage and driving time in the vehicle prior to writing this review but at least I could share a few things with a prospective buyer.  

In summation, my wife REALLY likes the vehicle.  The additional room, the ability to set up a little higher than you do in a typical sedan and ease of driving were big selling points.
I've changed my mind about several items.  The nine (9) speed transmission is sort of annoying , especially when driving through an area where it has to stay in a lower gear.  It's constantly ""Hunting"" for the correct gear.  Ours is the Advance SHAWD version and it has proximity collision monitors front and rear however I think that ALL
 models should either have these as standard equipment or available as an option.  Safety should not be held hostage for an additional $6K option.  Still don't like the engine stop / start feature but it appears that numerous other auto manufacturers are opting to install the same thing in their vehicles.  Guess that's a way they can claim a fraction more gas mileage on their overall EPA rating.  Other than being a nuisance, I wonder what the toll is on the starter, battery, flywheel, etc. as additional wear and tear?
Having said those things, we continue to be very pleased with the vehicle!  Dependable, reliable and comfortable (both city and highway driving).  We would definitely purchase the same make and model again!
1/11/17 - 15,000 miles.  Vehicle is performing very well.  We have pretty much learned how to use all of the technology so that mini-crises has passed. We have not experienced any mechanical, electrical or driving issues with the SUV. Would continue to recommend it to other potential buyers.
1/16/18, 20,250 miles.  We're still happy with the Acura.

acura,mdx,2016,Sid J, 09/11/2015,I love my new 2016 MDX !,pos,"My wife and I were in the market for our first luxury crossover and we couldn't be happier with our purchase (Advance Pkg, SH-AWD). Let me say outright that we did not consider any German cars for reasons ranging from high price point/high maintenance to poor reliability/longevity. We weren't particular about having 3-rows, but felt it'd be nice to have the option (for trips with family/friends) - the MDX fit the bill perfectly. I've had my MDX for 6-weeks and driven 1800 miles, so its obviously too early to talk about reliability(which the Acura brand is known for) but here are the pros/cons as I see it.
Pros:
- Drives great. Plenty of power to summon in any situation (esply with Normal/Sport IDS modes).
- Very comfortable seats & ride. You don't feel minor road imperfections & the suspension does a great job of dampening out big potholes.
- Very quiet cabin. Conversation between 1st & 2nd row passengers have never been easier.
- Gas sipper (I use premium 93 octane). I consistently average over 24-mpg in combined driving. Averaged 26-mpg during a recent 600-mile road trip(80% highway) with 5 adults, fully loaded cargo space (3rd row folded). That said, I always use cruise at highway speeds and avoid very hard acceleration/braking.  I calculate MPG estimates to be 100% sure though the tip computer is not off by much (-0.5 to +1 MPG off actual).
- Realized the beauty of SH-AWD driving on curvy, hilly wet roads (yet to test on snow/heavy rain). Just when I thought I needed to hit the brakes to slow around a corner, the MDX breezes past with aplomb. It drives like a car - you don't feel body roll, side-to-side weight transfer during turns.
- Love all the safety features, esply the Lane departure warning.  I read recently that it received great crash-test scores.
Now for the Cons:
- Depending on the gear you are in, the transmission sometimes seems to lag for a split second before it accelerates. I believe this has to do with dog clutch in the ZF-9 speed design. 
- Adaptive cruise may seem hard on braking/acceleration depending on how you normally drive.
- Touchscreen response is a tad slower than I'd like it to be.
- Fog lights are offered only as an accessory (extra $)
- Power-folding side mirrors, panaromic roof,  motion-activated power liftgate not available.

I've seen people voice concerns on online forums regarding transmission, build quality(as MDXs are built now in Alabama Vs Canada until about a couple of years ago)  but based on my experience, I'm inclined to believe most of them are unjustified. There have also been complaints about higher than usual noise coming from under the hood(for someone outside the car) even when the a/c compressor is not running -  the owners manual clearly says that is expected as a result of the system checks ! Complaints related to dual-screen is a matter of getting used to - I actually find it convenient. The 3rd row of seating is mostly for kids (or short adults for upto 2-hr ride). In my opinion, this is the most well-rounded luxury crossover offering an optimal mix of comfort, handling, value and safety. Get one - you'll love it !

acura,mdx,2016,Carlos, 08/27/2016,This SUV almost got us hurt,neu,"We got a new 2016 MDX and before it hitting 3 months, our new MDX almost got my whole family hurt (or could have been worst). While driving on the freeway it just suddenly stop while I was changing lane. Luckily the car behind us managed to stop and avoid hitting us. I tried to restart the engine and when it did, it move very slow and roughly to the shoulder of the freeway. After restarting the engine, ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS  came ON including Break System Failure or Malfunction. It scared my whole family and it was the most horrible UNSAFE DRIVE HOME for hours worrying if we still have break system working. Dropped of the MDX at our local dealership and until now (about 9 days now) still trying to figure  things out.. We feel like this vehicle is just so UNSAFE now and it basically traumatized my whole family being in this MDX.  Will review lemon law and make sure we don't become the CRASH TEST DUMMIES for this. And I hate hearing them say ""Oh it must be because of the computers and technology""!.... We got this vehicle because of the SAFETY AND TECHNOLOGY advertised by Acura.

acura,mdx,2016,jl, 09/04/2016,They just can't get it right,neg,"I thought many times before writing this review. I felt that there was no need to let others know about my problems , but my conscience just kept telling me to share my thoughts with the media. When I was driving home the first time from the showroom there was a metal knocking noise under vehicle and was quite concerned. I immediately called my salesman who put me through to service.the manager said there is a bulletin on this but acura had no fix ,but are working on one. i asked how long? and he responded by saying they have been working on it since 2014.I laughed and then choked and said what are you talking about. He said the design of the parking brake cable was not designed correctly and it knocks like a chain hitting the bottom. after quite a few adjustments and the rear brakes overheated from  overtightening the cable, I just gave up and  said I will live with it until acura comes up with a fix. Well, to continue, Ive had countless parking sensor issues that just go off even if no one is around waiting for the red light to change. It sometimes scares me thinking another vehicle is approaching .The only way to shut the sensors off is to override them and shut the system off completely. they removed my bumper 6 times ( damaging the bumper)and replaced modules and sensors and harness and still no fix.The dealers remedy is to just shut them off permanently, even though i bought the advance model to get this option factory installed.My preset steering wheel only works sometimes. My 9 speed tranny clanks ,I guess it wants to let me know its still there . My brakes practically go down to the floor and acura tells me that its ok. Seat adjustments are not great,but i guess acceptable. My rear backup camera looks like I have been driving in a dense fog ( useless) .They say other mdx cameras look similar. The ride quality on smooth roads is fine ,but try hitting a few minor potholes and it goes right through the cabin. While I was even servicing the vehicle a woman was complaining about the terrible ride quality and vowed to sell her mdx just to keep her sanity. There is a scraping noise when you first start the suv in the morning. Might I have to say more. Acura customer relations keeps telling me that they would like to continue working with me to correct these issues after more then 5 attempts ( i stopped counting) and yes I am aware of the lemon law.I said the right thing is to put me in another vehicle and you can continue to correcting these issues on your own and spend 24 hours a day to figure it out so other loyal customers don't suffer. Acura ,unfortunately with being the best selling luxury suv cannot get it right. i guess people gravitate to it because the price is great compared to other similar suvs .Also, acura shares the same mother company as the civic and accord who have held top honors for many year, so people that want luxury and reliability will hopefully get it like the honda products previously mentioned.I am not writing to punish acura  I just want them to get it right. In closing, Maybe I just might just decide to stop punishing myself one day and move on to another brand after owning acura's for many years. I guess Im finally getting wise that taking off a shield on the front grill or giving real wood trim instead of plastic will ultimately not shield this company from customers realizing that there is something wrong here. What acura needs to do instead of fixing a grill issue is to fix mechanical issues that are the real reason why people have always purchased honda products in the first place called reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Jim Wickstrom, 01/06/2016,Dealer invoice is BS! Love my 2016 AWD Acura MDX!,pos,"Three days after we purchased the Acura MDX, we drove it 500 miles to Lake Tahoe through blizzards!  The AWD works better than my 4/4 Toyota Sequoia!  We passed cars, trucks with chains.  .stuck! We drove right though.  At one point in time we were up to our door panels in snow!   On the way up we got 24 mpg and on the way home to San Diego, 28 mpg, thanks to a nine speed transmission and half the cylinders shutting down on cruise control!  It is unbelievable how well this works with 290 hp to boot.  Consumer reports rated this vehicle an 89 rating, tops in the luxury mid size SUV category. To be clear, we looked at SUVs from Porsche, BMW, MB, Lexus but none of them have the top rating and best repair service record as the Acura MDX.   BTW, if you are buying a car, ""bait' each dealership against each other. That is how we got this MDX for $44,500 when list was $50,250!  Do not believe the ""dealer invoice"" number as it is fabricated.  You should be able to beat dealer invoice by at least a grand!  As it seems, even Edmunds believes this BS dealer invoice number, too. Oops!

acura,mdx,2016,SideStepping, 10/10/2016,Could have been a Homerun,neu,"Owners should know, and DEMAND, that early 2016 models built in 2015 have a software update to the transmission, technical service builletin 15-054, which changes the shifting dynamic of the car, and SHOULD resolve most of the transmission jerkiness issues.  Unfortunately, my dealership didn't apply the update, BUT next time my car is in for service, I will DEMAND they fix it, because I too, experience rough shifting, surges while braking and going downhill, and poor overall transmission performance.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE ON THE TRANSMISSION.  ACURA, ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?  Acura should be embarrassed to turn away customers.  No wonder they are LAST in customer satisfaction.  Now...onto the car.  Two major issues with this car: the transmission, and the infotainment system. The interior is nice size and comfortable, even though it doesn't feel so luxurious.  Handling is great, ride is smooth when the transmission isn't jerking you all over the place.  The overall infotainment system, navigation included, is SO slow and my 2008 Infiniti G35 had a better nav system.  It's pretty pathetic.  This is my first (and probably last) Acura until they get their act together, stop trying to fool customers into thinking their product is the ""best in it's class,"" and until they produce a real transmission and a real infotainment system.  What a shame.  BTW, my dad had 3 MDXs...a 2009, a 2013, and a 2016.  He loved (and so did I) the 2009 and 2013.  He had the 2016 for 5 months and got rid of it.  That's how embarrassing of a vehicle it is.  But, I'm sure Acura is laughing all the way to the bank...what a joke of a 50K car.

acura,mdx,2016,Sack, 01/08/2016,First Acura MDX,pos,"We just picked this up last week without even having the intention of buying an Acura.  We originally looked hard into the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilots but realized the lease incentives were absolutely horrible due to the demand of both of those (we are in a spot in our lives where leasing makes more sense).  We started to look into non-3rd row options since our youngest is 2 and we have another one on the way in June, and we could go for a 3rd row when they got older. So I noticed a lease deal on an Acura RDX and wanted to investigate since we didn't like the RAV4 and CR-V options.  The RDX drove well but was too small.  The salesperson told me about a lease deal on a base MDX so we test drove it and LOVED IT.  The features are the same and the quality is better than the higher trim Highlander and Pilots and the lease payment was cheaper per month.  It has heated seats, leather, moonroof, backup camera, dual cabin screens, a 3rd row, jewel eye LED headlights, among other options.

My wife has been driving is most of the time but so far we love it.  Definitely give it a shot if you're open to lease and are considering Toyota/Honda 3rd rows - you'd be surprised on payments.

acura,mdx,2016,Debbie, 11/13/2016,Transmission is still bad!,neg,"I purchased a 2016 Acura MDX from Jay Wolfe Honda in Kansas City, MO a year ago and so far my total overall experience is a ""0"" I had my car in the shop for about 20% of the time I had owned it in the first 5 months and my last repair (5 months after my purchase) was to replace the transmission with 10,000 miles on the vehicle! It still shifts jerky at low speed.  I didn't get any satisfaction from the dealership or with Acura - they told me I would have to pursue arbitration.  I don't have the time and energy for that process so I will drive it for a year or so two and then trade it in.  I had a loud noise in the rear end, after they replaced the struts (after 3 repair attempts) and it is better. There are 3 Service Bulletins out there for those of you who want to try them TSB No 16-035 replace rear suspension dampers and rear upper mount bushings. TSB No 15-039 Replace transmission end cover gaskets TSB No 15-054 Software update in powertrain and transmission control modules.  I called Acura and none of these were linked to my specific vehicle VIN #.  Had they replaced the gaskets, I may not have had a fluid leak which supposedly caused the transmission replacement. The module update is supposed to correct the shifting - it didn't. The rear end work did help the noise in the rear end.  The fan blower for the air conditioner is so loud that even on the lowest speed, phone calls sound like you have your window rolled down.  The blue tooth quality is very poor - lot's of noise and tunnel sound even with nothing turned on in the car.  I could continue with minor detail issues but suffice to say I WOULD NOT purchase nor would I recommend anyone to purchase an Acura MDX!!

acura,mdx,2016,Very disappointed, 10/31/2015,2016 MDX vibration,neg,"I bought a 2016 Acura MDX within the first week I noticed a vibration between 55 to 75 mph, at 459 miles I took it in to the dealer to install the mounding I had purchased and told them it had a vibration they balanced the tires. It did not solve the problem, took it back a second time where I was told by the service writer that there was nothing wrong with the car, I would find nothing wrong with it and it drives just as well as any car on the lot. You can visibly see the steering wheel shake and feel the vibration. I took it in a third time, took a service technician out with me, he witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating. So I asked, ok we are in agreement that you witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating he said yes, I took his name and wrote it down along with date and time. The dealer had my car for about a week, which they did give me a loaner, they called and said they had figured it out, they replaced the brake rotors. Needless to say the vibration is still there, since then I have taken it to a tire store that told me I had three bad tires, took it back to the dealer, they road force balanced the tires, vibration is still there. I have been in contact with Acura Client Relations since the second service appointment, next step is meeting with the District Service Manager. Not to mention how the transmission shifts, I am hoping they come out with a software update for that. Needless to say I am very disappointed and regret purchasing the MDX.

acura,mdx,2016,frustrated, 04/14/2016,"6,800 miles, new transmission required?!",neg,"The transmission on this car is just crap.  I bought it brand new and didn't notice shifting problems on the test drive. I obviously should have test driven the same vehicle multiple times before purchasing it because after about three days I noticed the occasional awkward shifting.  I just told myself it's a brand new car and needs to adjust on its own. I feel like it did get better after a few months - or I just got used to the awkwardness. Sport mode was not even an option as it was super jerky and completely annoying.  At 6,800 miles it suddenly started making a high-pitched chirping noise when shifting into second gear, almost like the sound of tires screeching when peeling out. I immediately drove it to the dealership and the technician confirmed the issue. The next day they called and said the transmission needed to be replaced.  What!? I've owned several Hondas over the years and never had major issues. I thought I could trust Acura for their reliability record, but apparently not. The 2016 Touring/Elite models of the Pilot have the same crappy transmission and complaints are well documented. I hope Honda/Acura will take some responsibility for the defect and offer a recall. If not, I will be pursuing a lemon law buy back.

The car jerks going from gear 1 to gear 2 and also to gear 3. It is something that you are not supposed to feel on a $50k vehicle.....I have also checked with few of my buddies that own mdx. They have the same feeling about the gear shifting......What a bummer!!!

acura,mdx,2016,VJ, 03/03/2017,Transmission issue on brand new MDX,neg,"Purchased a brand new 2016 MDX and within 10 months started having problem with the transmission - jerking with sharp squeaking sound whenever gears shifted (lower gear). Had driven only around 9500 miles when this problem started. Dealership replaced the transmission, but then also changed the radiator and the starter (since those also apparently had issues !) - all this took almost a month. In short, major components were bad/poor quality (?) in a brand new car - only major remaining part to replace is the engine !!! After the repairs, car still gives slight jerk during gear shifts. Dealership and Corporate customer service response was - slight jerk is normal for MDX. So buyers beware - from personal experience it seems Honda quality is not transferred to its luxury brand !!! Consider alternatives & do your research before spending your dollars....
"
acura,mdx,2016,Not Happy, 12/01/2015,Vibrations!,neg,"I had also recently purchased the MDX and had the same vibrations as the previous post.  The story is the same - changed wheels, changed rotors, then balanced the tires.  They also decided to deflate the tires to mask the vibrations.  But I immediately caught them doing this and asked the dealer to  inflate the tires back to 35psi.  Acura is no help either.  Both Acura and dealership say this is normal variation of the MDX, and the lemon law does not apply since ""there is nothing wrong with the car"".  Seeing the prior post, this seems like a fraud or cover up.  Anyone else having this issue?
Finally the transmission is scary. It doesn't always shift to the correct gear.

acura,mdx,2016,KLance, 05/18/2016,Jerky Transmission + Clunky Shifting = last Acura,neg,"Background: Purchased this 2016 model in May of 2015 - have driven for a year.  Thud/clunk noise e-v-e-r-y time I accelerate from around 40 to a higher speed.  Head mechanic at dealer acknowledged this shouldn't be happening, had my car for weeks, put in a new drive train.  Problem still there so then they told me that all of the MDXs do this.  Wait-what??  Engine will shut off when I stop, every single time I stop, unless I deactivate the fuel saving feature.  Get in the car in the AM, deactivate, go to grocery, get back in car, deactivate, stop to get gas, get back in car, deactivate.  You can see how irritating this becomes on a daily basis.  Dealer tells me no way to get around this.  Driver's side window rattles when it's about 1/3 of the way down.  After my first month of driving this car, transmission made a thud noise when in reverse (dealer was able to fix this).  Very jerky ride at slow speeds (i.e., pulling slowly out of my driveway or rounding a corner).  Lots of ""cool"" touch screen controls -- until you realize that you can't just turn a knob to change the AC or heat, you have to hit the control screen multiple times.  Even my husband, who loves everything tech, complains about what a pain this is.  When you shift gears, rolls forward or backward quite a bit so don't you dare park too close to anything.  And there are other smaller things that make driving this vehicle every day unpleasant.  My car history: every 3-5 yrs, when a typical manuf. warranty runs out, I get a new car (I've been hit more than once so I'm very concerned about safety) and this is the WORST car I've ever owned.  I hate it.  What am I comparing it to?  Going way back to my Honda Passport, Mercedes ML350, Mazda MPV, Subaru Tribeca, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Volvo XC60 (all of them high-end models w lots of features).  This vehicle may get a great review after being test driven once for a car website, but check online and see how disappointed all of us owners are who have to drive it every day.

acura,mdx,2016,Mike, 10/26/2015,Great Vehicle with Terrible Infotainment,pos,"We recently leased a 2016 MDX AWD with Tech Package. If we were to do it again the smart money would be the base awd model with the AcuraWatch safety feature package. Let me explain why....First off the car rides, accelerates, stops, turns, and everything else regarding moving extremely well. Even the headlights are exceptional. The interior seating design and the way they slide  is also great. The safety features shake the steering wheel if you depart your lane and warn you when other cars are too close.  Whats left is the way you interact with the controls in the dash and on the steering wheel. Every single thing about the interaction with the controls is unnecessarily complicated. In many cases it takes an extra click or 2 in a menu than in other cars. For example to turn seat heater on you need to click a button on the screen, select the heat level, then close the sub-menu. In every other car on the planed you click the button once to turn on the seat heat then another click to change the heating level. I consider this annoying, but not a deal breaker. Then you get into the gps. The gps takes longer than most to figure out how to do the basics. Its cumbersome to enter an address. The guidance is also poor. Sometimes there is no audible instruction on when to turn and a strange map of your turn with a flag that isn't always oriented the way you are travelling.  To sum it up you are better off placing your phone with google maps over the nav screen. I can only hope there is some kind of update to enable android auto or the apple car os. Last but not lease the Bluetooth connectivity doesn't play nice with my samsung galaxy s6. Every 30 seconds or so it pops up an error it can't import the phonebook. A quick google search indicates this is a common issue for many.  Then you quickly find out the text interaction is terrible. When you get a text a notification takes over the entire screen asking what you want to do (imagine you were getting ready to make a turn following gps). So then when you act on the notification you have to pick from a very small list of predefined reply messages. Every other car I have used including cheap rentals allow you to speak a text reply. My other vehicle is 2015 ram 3500 with uconnect and it does all of this with no issues.  In a day and age where so much of your interaction with a vehicle is the electronics acura needs to do a much better job. The kicker is you pay thousands extra for this tech package and get terrible tech bundled with some really good safety features. After having the MDX a few months I can say I would buy it again, but would not get anything above a base model awd with acurawatch.

acura,mdx,2016,CFM, 08/23/2015,2016 Acura MDX AWD,pos,"We finally bought our new SUV or I guess they call it a crossover. Keep in mind we only have a few hundred miles on it so its still really early. We looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the MDX. As far as a luxury 7 passenger vehicles go this seemed to have everything we wanted and needed after a couple of weeks of shopping and doing serious looking at the German counter parts. The MDX meets all of our requirements as follows in no specific order. Luxurious, stylish, roomy, safe, quality. We hope the maintenance is low and that it will hold its resale value I guess time will tell. The ride is great in the awd however on bumpy roads you can hear some road noise. The steering is awesome The turning radius is amazing making u-turns a breeze. This is a very easy and stress free vehicle to drive. Unlike most of the reviews I have read the command center is easy to operate we were a little worried after reading the reviews but it is super simple! We thought we wanted the black on black but after looking at the Lunar Silver Metallic we fell in love with how it really accentuates the lines on the vehicle.

acura,mdx,2016,kris reilly, 03/13/2016,Always Acura?! Maybe not,pos,"Always head right to the Acura dealer when we need a car! Have an older Acura MDX that I love!!! The new Acura looks nice, handles well but seems a bit smaller inside (although I was told it is a few inches bigger) the head room in the third row is cut back because of the angle of the body. This limits who is able to sit back there. It is very jerky in the shifting while excelerating and if you are moving very slow it feel like you are not in gear...Not happy with that! In addition, the radio is horrible. Most stations that I listen to do not come in clear. I have no problem with this in my other Acura or even the car I had before this one. Clearly the antenna is not good! I just feel like from my old Acura (2005) to this one (2016) they have definiately cut corners and the quality is not as good! For the price you pay I would expect an all 5 star rating which I can not give. We have been loyal Acura cutomers but think that this may be it for me. I am able to get more perks from other vehicles for the same or lesser price. I will be shopping around for my next vehicle!

acura,mdx,2016,Steve Chang, 04/13/2016,"Overall, this SUV is a good compromise",pos,"After driving this vehicle for 12k mile, I think this vehicle is a good compromise. It's not as sporty as a BMW X5, not as big/bold as a Chevy Tahoe, not as pretty/sexy as an Audi Q5, but its (fully loaded) price is most likely the lowest in this group, its fuel efficiency is good (I averaged almost 21 mpg with mostly city driving, and about 28 mpg on highway), has very large cargo area (if you fold down the 3rd row), a quiet/comfortable ride, handles impresively on snow, and it comes with almost all the safety features that you can imagine.

A few major gripes:
1) Watch out for the middle seat's seatbelt (a real safety hazard, and a major design flaw) - since the seatbelt automatically retracts to the roof where it is anchored, my mom was hit hard on her face (by the seat belt buckle) as the middle passenger released his seatbelt.
2) On a two-lane windy road, the auto collision sensor can mistaken an oncoming vehicle (in the other lane) as an obsticle and suddenly hit the brake for you (which can be very scarely to anyone in the vehicle)
3) Unimpressive accleration for a 3.5L VTECH engine.
4) So-so brake performance
5) Lacks a ""360 degree camera"" which I believe is an option for other countries (since the owner's manual talks about it)
6) No way to program the vehicle to ""remember"" the heated seat settings, which can be very annoying in cold climates
7) Interia material is OK, but not in the same league with the Germans
8) Why an SUV requires premium fuel??

After 5 months and about 6,000 miles I noticed a ""clunk"" sound only on the upshift between 20 and 30 MPH.  Took it to the dealer and had a test drive with service manager.  He hears the sound and says ""I have never heard that sound before!""  I actually let him drive the car so he could hear and feel what sound it was making.  Sure enough they want to replace the whole transmission.  I was told something about a seal allowing some fluid into the transmission.  This is not what I would have anticipated for a car that costs this much!  Very disappointed, this is going to be a very long lease period that cannot wait for it to end.

So glad we had just went through a 1 lane stretch on 75 undergoing construction and were able to pull over to the side of the road.  Dealership was awesome, but this car is terrible.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Peter K., 10/26/2015,The vehicle that's gone from great to a total dud,neg,"I hardly ever write any reviews but figured I just had to do one on this vehicle. I owned a 2010 MDX Tech, which was a great car, that unfortunately got flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Then, I got an ML350 and when the lease was up, we decided that we needed another 7-seat vehicle. So, as we'd already had an MDX before, we figured we couldn't go wrong with that one, right? Wrong! 
The first thing I noticed on my drive home from the dealership is that the car becomes ridiculously jerky while in traffic. The new 9-speed transmission just doesn't work well for daily city driving or when you're stuck in traffic on a highway. If you live in a rural area, chances are you'll never experience this. But if you're in traffic every day, well... you've been warned. I've adjusted my driving style since then and learned that switching IDS to ""Comfort"" makes it a little better. The problem, however, never went away and the dealer refused to acknowledge its existence despite the fact that Acura message boards are filled with similar complaints (I should have read those before I got the car).
Then, there's the touch screen. It's very slow with a non-intuitive interface. I've had it lock up several times while selecting a route.
I've always played my music from a USB flash drive and this is another area where this car is a total disaster. Once music is on, you can't switch tracks until the car's MP3 system is done reading the whole drive. So, it takes about 2-3 minutes in my case before I can switch songs or select another album/artist. It could be my flash drive but it's the same one I used on the 2010 and ML350 - worked flawlessly there.
We have two car seats installed in the second row (one behind the driver's seat and another in the middle). It's impossible to pull down the remaining second row seat and access the third row when there's a car seat in the middle. I had no problem doing that in the ML (needed the remaining seat pulled down sometimes to transport my bicycle).
Finally, there's the cargo net or lack thereof. I kept the cargo net from the 2010 and was able to easily install it on the ML. I figured it would also fit on the 2016 MDX. Wrong again! Acura has changed that as well.

acura,mdx,2016,Daniel, 10/13/2015,"Not what I had hoped for $50,000+",neu,"It came down to the 2016 Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, BMW X5, and 2015 Toyota Highlander.  We were inclined to get the XC90 for all the safety features & the incredibly cool look. The drive is great, however it felt really risky getting a brand new everything car.  The dealer had been saying they would get in Jan, the first ones did not appear till May and it seemed like they were trying to get it right.  Visibility was ok.  However, loaded with all the safety features it was getting to 60  though it starts at $47 all cars had very confusing option packages & what is considered a safety feature.  The test car 3rd row seat seem to have a problem. Then they recalled the vehicle to fix the third row airbags. We keep cars for 10 years & did not want to be going back to the dealer over and over again. The final straw is when they were offering factory maintenance for all models except the XC90 which had 1 year less of the maintenance.  On a new model they should not insert more doubt.  The BMW drove great but the 3rd row was not big enough for anyone over the age of 12 so had to cross it off.  The highlander felt less luxurious but most importantly did not have all the safety systems that we were looking for so we decided to pass. At the time the 2016 was not out, it appears from the reviews that they have added some safety features. We were left with the pilot and the MDX. In the end, the Pilot's cheap minivan arm rest on the drivers side along with the bad handling and turning radius on turns made us skip it.   Any man over 200 pounds will find there is no way to lean on the arm rest comfortably.  The turning handling and radius were a big concern also as on a sharp turn near our house the car veered into the oncoming traffic lane.  We did it twice.   Finally, unless you get the highest trim the handling is so ""trucky"" the kids got out and were ready to throw up.   This left us with the MDX.  We were excited to be moving up in the luxury ranks and were hoping the reliability would be there also.  After a bad selling experience we picked up the car and immediately noticed things.  There is a paint defect under the clear coat on the roof. There was a sticker there so it was clearly a known problem and they sold to us anyway. We have complained with no response. The hood does not latch unless you slam it.  If the hood is already down there is no way to close it without opening it and slamming it.  Finally if you look around the car you can see multiple places where the rubber is not flush including the doors & hood.  I walked around the lot and would say 50% of the cars had the same problem. Not what we had expected at $50+ .  Dealer was no help with these issues, I have read on line about cars getting water on the inside I am hoping that the rubber problems will not cause that. When you go to the car wash & open the back doors there is water in the painted part.  As for the drive it is pretty good, the 9 speed transmission is a little bouncy especially as low speeds, but no one is getting dizzy at least. The stop start feature takes getting used to, as if you need immediate power like turning onto a highway of making a left turn onto oncoming traffic, the car will hesitate long enough to make it dangerous.  You have to turn the wheel of take your foot of the pedal to start the car & be ready to go, or turn the feature off, however if you do that I can't imagine how much worse the gas mileage it would be. We are getting 15.5 in the city, & its Premium so it has been surprising.   Power in the SHAWD is very good & its a quiet ride with good handling.  Seat comfort for a large driver is not as good as I would have hoped.  I would like the seat to go back more when its high up and it just wont, so you end up sitting kind of low which removes one of the benefits of and SUV.  As for the safety features the lane assist works well on a
 Interstate highways at high speed, not so good in other settings. The automatic follow feature is very sensitive and breaks really hard and speeds up hard, so much so that you can't use it.  The break alert system works ok, I wish it would also go on if I am breaking but not hard enough. It will not stop the car automaticlally at low speeds like the volvo. The heads up display in bright sun creates a distracting reflection on the winshield & and the pairing with SIRI does not work well.  The NAV is a complete waste of money, I wish I could convert the screen to show my iphone instead. Nav traffic & directions sub par in every way.  The voice input is the same as our 08 Accord, very clunky. AC is hard to keep constant, need to adjust all the time.  In the end we are very disappointed with what we hoped would be an amazing car.  We hope it lives up to the reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Ron, 07/01/2016,After 2 months...Love this MDX!,pos,"I researched the the 2016 MDX for 9 months before buying. I'm so glad I did. I've owned two MDX's since purchasing my first MDX in year one of the MDX introduction in 2001. I'm amazed at the transformation, I'd been driving my MDX with 180K miles. Having also been an RL owner, I now feel I have the best of both vehicles in one. The slightly lowered height from the road is just perfect! The few lower reviews of the entertainment system has not been a problem for me. There's a lot to digest with so many great features, I take each feature one at a time which for me has been an enjoyable easy process. I love the new touch gear shifting! I love the sportier drive for an SUV, it really does not feel like I'm driving an SUV. The gas mileage increase is sweet, which is one reason I waited so long to buy a 2016. Love the seat air ventilation system that keeps me from back sweating during hot summer months. I can now seamlessly play music from my iPhone. The biggest surprise and enjoy is the warning system and lane keeping assist system. I feel like I'm now protected from blind spots when changing lanes and drifting out of my lane. This is simply the best vehicle I have ever owned! A huge leap of comfort, safety and technology in the past 10 years! I've never experienced this big of an upgrade in any vehicle I have ever purchased. Love this vehicle!!!

acura,mdx,2016,Don Thomas, 11/03/2015,Surge on,neu,"This transmission is awful!  Take your foot off the gas going down a hill and the car surges rather than slow down. Have to step on the brakes hard to slow it down.  Same issue when downshifting with the paddles.  

Also stutters when going into drive.

Voice commands are a joke.  I say find nearest ATM.  She says turn air conditioner up.  And so it goes.

This is my third MDX but it is my last.

acura,mdx,2016,:(, 05/04/2016,Problem in two week after 630 miles,neg,"These is the list of problems that I had after two weeks (630 miles) 
The Car is in service center.

1. Navigation problem with failed HDD - take about week to fix
2. Transmission,  The ride is jerky at low speed - service told me that never reported as problem  and not fix for it. 
3. Back up camera feed is showing for long time after driving forward - They will try to fix it.

* Dealer told me nothing wrong with transmission and try different settings might fix the problem which means no solution and no fix.
*  I had 4 Honda/Acura  before Prelude, Pilot, CL, RL and this time I am so disappointed.  Maybe no more Honda/Acura in the future.

This is follow up on the fix.
* Dealer service department call me after 1.5 weeks after I drop off the car about a problem with audio system.   Now waiting for new audio system to arrive.
   Mean time the loaner car is making squeaking sounds and this car has only 3800 miles.  I hope other people have better luck with this car.

acura,mdx,2016,Terry, 05/25/2016,Terrible Transmission,neg,"I have had the car for 7,000 miles now. The transmission is very jerky. There are times when making a right turn going from high to low speed and trying to get the car back up to speed is a pain. I have to push the accelerator much harder around turns and the car struggles to find a gear. For a luxury car, this is not acceptable. The drive is not fun at all and the service department at Weir Canyon Acura said this is the way the car drives. I have called Acura directly to log a complaint. Contact them directly so they can fix this issue. I don't think I would buy another Acura again.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Heather, 04/26/2016,Mostly OK with the SUV - terrible transmission!,neg,"Mostly this car is OK for the price.  But the transmission is terrible and has an odd shift that makes it uncomfortable to drive and for passengers.  No matter what ""mode"" you're in.  It's been in the shop twice now for this problem and we just keep hearing - it is what it is.  Which is frustrating given how much we are paying for it.  The Acura service department we also have been going to is less than stellar at communication and makes us even more frustrated with the car.  I loved, loved, loved my first Acura many  years ago - but I do not think I will be purchasing / leasing another one anytime soon.

acura,mdx,2016,Darrin Mangiacarne DO, 06/29/2016,Transmission Gone at 7400 miles,neg,"My car was making a loud squeak sound while shifting gears.  I was told that there is a leak of coolant into the transmission.  They need to replace the transmission already.  What a piece of junk.  Can't believe that I bought this car.  Going to go after the Lemon Law for assistance.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Krang, 11/06/2016,Transmission went after 15k,neg,"I have had my SUV in for repairs several times. Window would go up and down. In the fourth try they almost fixed it. It doesn't just go down on its own any longer. It just doesn't stay up if you roll it down. It takes about 4-5 tries. The USB ports don't work. They said it's my phone, I have had 6 chargers and a new phone since my purchase. The computer/transmission has been in 3 times. They claimed it was a computer issue with shifting. However when my car failed to go over 30 MPH. I called, their response was there is no engine light on, there is no problem. However after my car being there for a week, they called to let me know the transmission is faulty and needs to be replaced. I called my sales rep (who we've used for 5 cars) to see if he could swap my car out for a similar one. He didn't help and told me to call Acura and file a complaint. He also said they will not do anything to help you. Extremely disappointed after spending 50k on a lemon. I did plan on purchasing this car at the end of the lease.
"
acura,mdx,2016,brianc, 01/24/2017,I can't believe this is an Acura...,neg,"After owning 5 Accords, 2 Odysseys, 1 CRV and a Pilot without any issues, I figured the next logical step was Acura. We test drove and almost bought a Ford Explorer Sport, but the Honda loyalist inside of me said the Acura would be a better overall purchase. From the moment we leased this MDX 6 months ago it has been a HUGE let down. The transmission is horrible and shifts almost violently (dealer said this is normal), the suspension pops and clunks on every bump (3 attempts by dealer to fix), the touch screen is cool in theory, but when you just want to turn on the seat heater or adjust the fan it takes far too much effort.  The cargo area is poorly designed (in my opinion) because the roof slopes in the rear and limits capacity. The seats seem to be okay; they are a little small for my 6'3"" frame but my wife finds the car comfortable. On the plus side, the ride on the freeway is compliant and gas mileage is phenomenal (although, keep in mind you have to use premium fuel which offsets some of the MPG savings). I love the LED headlamps, but more and more cars are adding this feature, which makes is less special on the Acura. Remote starter was standard on my Accord, but we had to pay $400 extra for it on the Acura. Overall, the car looks much better than it performs. I never thought I would say this about a Honda product, but if you are in the market for a midsize SUV, do yourself a favor and drive several other vehicles...this Acura just doesn't live up to it's name.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Adam Stiles, 01/08/2019,Overall a great vehicle,pos,"I read all the reviews about the 9speed transmission prior to buying a CPO MDX with 12,500 miles on it.  I knew full well it’s drawbacks and limitations.  For most of my driving life I have driven manual transmission vehicles.  Now at a different stage of my life I need an SUV.  I am a discerning driver that generally notices every bump, rattle, hesitation, or jerky behavior.  I have owned vehicles with automatic transmissions and even won a lemon law case against a Jeep largely because of problems with that part of the car.  I find the transmission of this MDX to be pretty good, and much better than I anticipated.  It shifts pretty quickly, for the most part smoothly, and helps the car be very efficient.  Occasionally it can be caught flat footed or give a rough shift, but virtually every automatic transmission can.  I have learned how to compensate for this.  If you need to accelerate to pass, floor it and you can back off if needed.  The computer sends the message and the car drops gears pretty quickly.  Putting the IDS into sport mode helps some too.  My car came with the software update and I think it’s logic is pretty good.  Others Abe driven my car and nobody balls at the transmission.

As for the rest of the car, it is pretty well thought out.  I get 21-22mpg around suburban town and on the open highway have crested 28mpg on a trip average.  I think those are impressive numbers for a powerful AWD SUV.  Cargo space is very useable and generous.  Seating is comfy, especially on long hauls.  The ELS stereo is phenomenal, provided you adjust the settings (I dialed up the bass and subwoofer).  This car is also whisper quiet on the open road - everyone that is in my car notices this.  For a biggish SUV it handles well and accelerates quickly.  Visibility from the drivers seat is excellent.  The headlights are also top notch.

One of my bigger concerns was the much aggrieved infotainment system.  It almost stopped me from buying the car.  I’m reality, you get used to it and it’s not as bad as I expected.  If you have an iPhone, Siri Eyes Free lets you text and call people easily.  I put the climate control on AUTO and simply set the temp to what I want.  The fan, vent direction, and seats adjust.  The NAVI works well.  I was disappointed that entry was disabled while the vehicle is moving.  However, I prefer to enter it by voice, which now uses a natural address.

My complaints with this car are minimal.   I don’t like the funky wide angle driver side mirror.  I don’t think I will ever get used to it.  The adaptive cruise control is rough.  I don’t love it and most of the time just disable it in situations where it’s claim is to be useful.  Lastly, I think the brakes are a little underwhelming.  I had them resurfaced under warranty shortly after delivery.  They are ok but I still sometimes think I feel pulsing.

Overall, I think it is a very well rounded car.  I am very happy with it and would definitely buy another one."
acura,mdx,2016,Joey, 12/12/2015,Smooth like a weedwacker,neg,"What happened to Acura?  It used to be a luxury brand!  The 9 speed transmission cannot figure out what gear to be in.  And the ride is very bouncy!  Lot of vibrations when driving on the highway.  If you plan on spending $50k, I would look elsewhere."
acura,mdx,2016,bluehvn, 12/06/2016,Lipstick on a pig,neg,"This car has all of the creature comforts.   Good handling, comfortable interior, quiet on the inside, great gas mileage for an SUV.   None of those things matter, because these vehicles have BAD TRANSMISSIONS!    Have you ever been in a car with someone who is learning to drive a stick shift?   That's the way this car shifts in low gears.  It bucks, snorts, hesitates, and can't decide what gear to be in.  If you are coasting down a hill, it surges and accelerates.  Driving in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic was like wrestling a bear.  More than once I thought I had been rear-ended in slow moving traffic.....nope, just the car shifting.   I had the car back to the dealership 4 times.  They couldn't get their stories straight.   The Salesman told me it could not possibly be doing what I described and dismissed me.  The Service Manager said ""yeah, I've had 14 of those in here doing the same thing this week.  That's' just the way they drive"".   The District Manager told me that the car was hunting for the right gear to save me money on gasoline.   After 20 years of driving Acuras, I will never again be a customer.  I traded the car with 10,000 miles on it and took a huge financial loss.

acura,mdx,2016,I drive a death trap!, 10/04/2018,Death Trap On Wheels,neg,"I have been going round & round with Acura for months with nothing resolved. Since leasing the MDX in 2016 shifting & transmission has been horrible. That was an annoyance! Acura sent out a letter stating that it 2016 MDX were experiencing linkage issues. I called the dealership (that was 3 hours from my house) - the service department stated this was something they could only assess during the week. No exceptions! I explained that I was driving in and would need to have this looked at over the weekend. I was told there was not deadline on this warranty issue & to call when I would be available during the week.  The hard shifting/ jerking only continued to increase and have intermittent times of briefly losing power while driving. Several months later ( after moving closer to a dealership) - I took the vehicle in to the service department. No one has knowledge of the letter that was sent out to the consumer. They told me that resetting the software would take care of the issues.  ABSOLUTELY NOT - THEY ARE WORSE!! Several weeks after resetting the software - I was driving 75/80 mph on interstate passing a semi & traffic behind me and my MDX lost power. I would push on the accelerator and nothing! This was completely terrifying for me & my daughter who was in the passenger seat. Within 20 seconds or so - power kicked back in. The only positive in this situation is I was on a 4 lane interstate and not passing someone on a 2 lane highway.  I took the vehicle into another Acura dealership and left it for a couple of days. They tried everything and can not get a diagnostic read on the computer.  So - I know have a $40,000 vehicle parked in my driveway waiting for the lease to expire. As Acura has made very clear - without diagnostics - there is nothing wrong with the vehicle.  This vehicle is no longer a nuisance to drive - but a safety issue for my family & everyone else on the road.  Acura has been more than accommodating to release me another vehicle and let me out of my lease on the 2016 MDX.  NO THANK YOU!! I am now in the process of filing a complaint with my State Attorney General and contacting my personal attorney.  Apparently Acura does not care about the safety of the consumers driving/riding in their products or their liability of sticking their head in the sand and ignoring their issues. Google 2016 MDX complaints & you will see that I am not alone!!

acura,mdx,2016,Chris, 08/02/2016,Disappointed With the Test Drive,neu,"I've owned 3 MDXs--2005, 2010, 2014 and I've loved them all. Each of those years I test drove  a variety of SUVs  (the usual suspects) and always ended up with the Acura!  So when the 2017 Acura hit the showroom last week, I was pretty sure I would end up buying another one.  It's not going to happen.  Took it for a test ride and noticed immediately how differently it shifted when accelerating onto a highway.   Couldn't get out of its own way--that's the way it feels anyway.  Back in the showroom the salesperson told me they changed the gears from 6 to 9 back in 2016.  I have no idea what that means I only know that the car doesn't feel right going through NINE gears.  Like I'm towing a boat or something.  It has the power; it just takes too long to get to it.  What a shame--just when they finally changed the front grill.

acura,mdx,2016,Tom, 01/07/2016,Nice ride but a few issues,neu,"We have leased this SUV for 2 years. It has been a pleasure to drive. The ride is generally smooth and comfortable. The infotainment system is not very intuitive, can be annoying at times, and the bluetooth does not work seamlessly, in comparison to our 2017 Toyota Tacoma and 2016 RAV4.  We have had minor transmission problems that caused the vehicle to jerk forward when near idling at very low speeds. That problem seems to have been fixed with a computer system reboot. However, we have had intermittent tailgate malfunctions that the dealer to this point has been unable to resolve. At this point we haven't decided on whether to purchase at the end of the lease. We probably will not switch to a lease on a new MDX considering that Consumer Reports no longer recommends the MDX based on lower than average reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Karen, 08/05/2016,The Money Trap,neg,"I looked for a new car for months and decided on this nice MDX, only to be left on the side of the road when the transmission broke.  We waited 3 hours for a tow truck to come.  My 2016 MDX had just 3800 miles on it.  I asked for a new transmission, but they said all it needed was a gasket.   I ghad a BMW which I loved, but it had 190,000 miles on it and I wanted dependable transportation for traveling now this is what I am stuck with.  I will say the people at the Acura dealer were very nice, but I did not get great end results.  When you spend that kind of money and this happens they should make it right.

My car has been the the service department in Omaha, NE 3 times and the first two times they quickly replaced parts and said they fixed the noise. The 3rd time, I rode with a service tech and service manager and they heard the noises but said they did not know how to fix it.  When I returned to pick up my car the service invoice coveniently mentioned that they ""could not duplicate the noise"". I got no support from the dealership at all and called Acura Corporate hoping for some better service but no such luck.  They will tell you this very loud noise is a characteristic of the vehicle and likely won't do anything to fix it! Do not buy an Acura MDX!

acura,mdx,2016,Paul Moyer, 08/02/2015,First Acura,pos,"After owning several BMW's, Mercedes, and lastly a Jeep Grand Cherokee, I decided to look at Acura due to its quality reputation and value.  A comparable BMW or Porsche would have cost 20K more.  I was immediately impressed with the comfort, quality, and performance.  Although not as sporty as BMW products I have owned, it drives and corners smartly.  Probably the quietest vehicle I have owned.  After many dealership visits with the Jeep, I look forward to years of routine service only with the Acura.

acura,mdx,2016,Vincent Cerbo, 09/20/2016,Shifting issues.,neu,"I've only owned it for three weeks. The nine speed transmission has issues when shifting into second and third.

acura,mdx,2016,Ron, 12/23/2016,Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,pos,"I've driven the Acura MDX model since it arrived in 2001 and been an Acura owner since 1995. This being my 4th MDX the 2016 is the best driving experience I've ever had. I was a little nervous with the move to a crossover design, happy with the feel of the RL I've missed. The slight one inch lowering to the ground was a concern but still keeps me high enough on the road to see ahead in traffic. The new safety innovations are incredible and give me a new sense of road safety beyond what I've ever experienced. The gas mileage is through the roof beyond what I expected which was my main motivation for buying in May of 2016. I don't get all the transmission complaints, but I must say, I don't drive the car fast, I drive it economically for safety and good gas mileage. For this reason, the car is a dream. If you want a sports car, then go buy one. I love having the option of the engine stopping if you press the brake a tad harder at a stop. At first this was strange, but now a natural part of driving the car. All the technology took a small learning curve but once you learn, it's part of you. My Acura dealership has been completely responsive with any questions I have. The MDX handles beautifully with new smart technology helping to keep me in my lane when driving the freeway. I love the distance setting of three choices when using cruise. I'm not trying to out drive anyone, just selecting my space on the freeway to drive most economically. Hitting 28 miles to the gallon on a long trip is the best MPG I've ever received from any Acura. The sound system and tech package is delivers all I need and then some. This new 2016 MDX delivers the most enjoyable driving experience I've ever had!

"
acura,mdx,2016,Christopher Trinh, 11/26/2015,Exterior Quality,pos,"Overall it rides nice and very comfortable. The downside is that the Acura MDX has built quality issues. The panels either don't lineup or the gap is not even. For instance, the fuel door is off center, both side of the trunk lift gate have uneven gaps and both side of the front top fender panels are off and don't lineup with the front bumper. Very disappointed and I would consider other brand of SUV such as Lexus in the near future. If you are in the market for any Acura vehicle, do check for quality built issues. Chances are the panels don't lineup and the gaps are not even.

The engine idle stop feature does not work at all after a few miles. In addition, don't even try to connect a smartphone because the vehicle does not recognize it no matter how hard you try. This is not what I anticipated for a new vehicle especially an Acura MDX. 

My conclusion is I would look to other brand of SUV before considering the MDX.

acura,mdx,2016,Shawn Ayers, 05/25/2016,First MDX,pos,"The MDX overall comfort with all the gadets is top notch. If I had to write any negatives about the vehicle would be the lack of fog lights for a near $60K luxury SUV. The other, is merely personal with regards to settling for the MDX as it wasn't our first choice because ""everyone"" seems to have one. On the flip side, after driving the MDX and the overall comfort I see why every seems to be driving an MDX everywhere I look. 

My wife absolutely loves driving it as our family vehicle. It is spacious and very comfortable. I would purchase again!

Even after I send videos of it occurring they refused to accept responsibility or communicate. Acura clearly doesn't care about customers after they make the purchase. The navigation system and voice recognition system is really a joke as well. I replaced it with a dash-mounted iPhone. The car does handle well and the all-wheel drive is great.

acura,mdx,2016,Peter, 11/16/2016,2016 Acura MDX ... NO Spare tire ... no tools,pos,"The base model has no spare tire and no tools to change one.  I was stuck with a flat tire and had to go through an ordeal to get the flat fixed.

acura,mdx,2016,2016MDX-Owner, 12/11/2017,"Comfortable and spacious, but technology is subpar",neu,"I owned this car for 2 years and have about 45,000 miles on it. First, the good things: the car is spacious, our family of 4 took it on long road trips and it has enough space for all our stuff. It's not as much space as a Honda Pilot, but enough. The car is relatively quiet and has comfortable ride. Inside materials are fine, nothing special, but nice to look at and touch. If I could have this car for $40K, it would be a great deal. The things that are not so great: acceleration, you hit the gas and the car thinks a couple of seconds before deciding to lurch forward, redline and then slowly speed up. The only way to deal with this is floor it when merging on a highway or passing, then the car (most of the time), accelerates straight away and relatively smoothly. I got an advance package with lane assist and distance control. Distance control is 'ok on a highway (but I don't trust it in stop/go traffic). Lane assist is awfully designed, every 30 seconds it shows me to put my hands on the steering wheel (I usually have a couple fingers at the bottom of a steering wheel) and if I don't respond, it silently disengages and car starts to drift, WTF? How about an audible alert or something to tell me it's about to disengage before driving me into a ditch? The only time I use it is on a long stretch of a highway with not many turns or cars around when I can rest my hand on a steering wheel. The whole technology package (navigation, audio, etc.) was clearly outsourced to the lowest bidder in a third world country, in my opinion. Monochrome! button selection with no apps (at least it's touchscreen). My 2012 Toyota has better navigation/audio/apps than this 2016 Acura MDX (Yes, I am one of those folks who wants to listen to Pandora or check a forecast while stuck in traffic). Blutooth is bad too, the car decides to use my phone for making calls and my wife's phone for music, how is it even makes any sense? If you are willing to accept these limitations, MDX is not bad, mostly because it appears reliable and comfortable. Oh, BTW, I got 45,000 miles on a car and tires need to be replaced, so just average life with stock Continental tires.

Update: Edmunds sent me an email asking for an update in 2020, here you go- I am currently at 85,000 miles, this car did not get better with age, both catalytic converters had to be replaced before I even hit 70,000 miles. Thankfully it was under warranty, otherwise its a $2K job, I think I also sunk another $1k-$2k replacing something that's supposed to last for 100,000-150,000 miles but gave way long before that. Otherwise, its normal maintenance. My friends with BMWs and Audis spent more on repairs, though, LoL.

acura,mdx,2016,Wei Li, 09/04/2016,strong smell from leather seat,neg,"I bought a 2016 MDX at Apr 2015. The car has unusual new car smell. At the beginning, I thought it will disappear soon .I am wrong. I can't stay in the car without the window open for more than one year. But unfortunately after two summers, the smell of new car just reduced a little bit and the leather seat still gives off strong chemical odor. I can confirm because if I smell closely to the leather it's just too strong chemical odor. I have owned multiple cars with leather seats before. This is the first time I hit the issue. I very understand that leather products usually has ""leather smell"" and I actually like that. But this smell from ACURA 2016 MDX seats is not typical genuine leather smell. It's just unpleasant chemical smell.  At the time I bought the 2016 MDX, I noticed it smells more strong than 2015 MDX. And it seems to be issue with all 2016 MDX at least the first batches.  I was told by many people that baking the car in summer could reduced the new car smell. Now I have done it twice in the summer. Almost every sunny day I leave the car outside and open the window just a little. I have verified it doesn't work for this car. Because this time, issue is from seat. I am pretty issue besides the seat, the smell is OK. Just the leather chemical smell is too bad. One detail I noticed is there is no smell from back piece of seat. I am guessing that the back piece of the seat has different leather.

acura,mdx,2016,Suzanne Thorpe, 09/16/2015,My first SUV purchase,pos,"I typically drive a vehicle for as long as possible. So when my 2003 Toyota Camry was starting to show some signs of wear and tear after 13 years, I decided to check out the new SUV's.  For me I wanted comfort, quiet, smooth handling, navigation package, something easy enough to get my aging parents into, and most importantly something with a solid reputation of being a reliable and quality vehicle.  My pros: I found that I liked sitting a bit higher on the road. The drive is very comfy, quiet and the vehicle is very responsive.  When I test drove the car I got the speed up to 90 entering the interstate before the salesman in the backseat coughed uncomfortably, but the car never hesitated and was very responsive. The headlights provide an amazing view of the road at night. The bluetooth for phone calls is crystal clear. I am using midgrade octane gasoline and I am averaging 24.5 mpg. My cons: I wish the cup holder was a smidge larger so it could hold my bubba cup of water. The navigation system is a little confusing but now that I am used to it things are fine but it took some patience on my part. The driver seat is self adjusting to driver 1 or 2 but I wish that I could get the seat to automatically move further back than it does upon going into park.  I understand that Acura has accessories for sale but I think that for the amount of $$$ you spend they could have included a net in the cargo area to keep the groceries from sliding around, I think it should have been standard not optional. Overall I really have been impressed so far and have not once regretted my purchase.  I don't have any maintenance issues to report after 4 months of ownership.

acura,mdx,2016,Ram, 08/30/2016,Great hype but no substance,neu,"The folks at dealership are great in service and sales but they cannot solve the issues which are congenital to Acura important one being Jerky transmission , the movement is jerky at low speeds, during accelration and marked in low gear (S). The climate control fans make loud noise . A software update made it worse.  Even the seat memory fails !! Bluetooth cannot recognize my wife's Iphoe 6+!!!. Audio is good.

acura,mdx,2016,Bob K, 06/12/2018,9-speed Transmission Needs to Go,neg,"This is my third Acura. I am sorry i bought it.  We purchased a 2016 MDX technology - a non titled dealer loaner in Oct17 with 9800mi.  I cannot stand the jerking shifts the transmission makes when you start off.  It is flat out annoying.  And yes, as I read in reviews, it also lunges a bit when it downshifts right before a stop.  Scarry.  Also, if you use the paddles to downshift manually, the car goes into neutral for long pause between downshifts causing the vehicle to actually speed up (like it is in neutral)  when you want to click down and slow down.  The brakes are also questionable. It seems like there is air in the system.  They really grab well if you hit them a second time every time you are stopping. They don't seem affective if you don't.  We are also amazed how little drink holder utility there is.  Don't think about leaving with two drinks - ie coffee and water.  The USB ports are also extremely difficult to plug into.  This vehicle also need a new driver door seal as wind noise rushes in next to the drivers left ear.  And finally, good luck acclimating to the nav system.  Wish I had spent more time in the Infinity - The QX60 is so smooth so quiet and so roomy.  I hope I have given a potential buyer something to think about - especially the horrible transmission. This is an update one year later:  Still sorry I bought it.  The car lunges every time you start off.  The rear end clunks on the slightest pavement cracks which I never hear in my Hylander.  This car is not worth the money.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Mike B, 04/30/2016,Not what I was expecting from Acura,neu,"Chose the MDX for a few reasons - reliability, versatility, build quality, value.  Been very surprised that car does not deliver well on at least two of those traits.  Had a transmission issue the first day I drive the car.  Transmission got stuck in low gear.  Was solved with a software upgrade and been ok so far.  I did a lot of research on the transmission issues and was under the impression that the ills of 2015 were fixed in 2016.  Not sure of that.  Next issue was a rattle from the rear of the car since day 1.  Turns out that a bolt was dropped into the chassis during assembly which required taking out part of the interior to find.  How did that ever pass the quality check before delivery I don't know.  On a positive note, I am actually getting great mileage - averaging 25 mpg on the freeways, far better than my last Lexus.  But the car feels cheap and as if corners were cut.  Lots of plastic and poor damping on the different cubbies in the car.  My Lexus was far superior for only about $3k more.  Still 2 1/2 years on my lease but this is my last Acura.  I grew up on Hondas and Acuras but feel Acura, at least, has lost its way.  Back to Lexus for me.

acura,mdx,2016,Fred Lauber, 10/04/2018,Great SUV! Poor electronic interface.,pos,"The touch screen interface for navigation is horrible--you have to twist a dial to spell out where you want to go. I use Waze on my phone instead. The touch screen for music isn't much better. One more problem is that the transmission occasionally gets confused and shifts erratically.  Other than those two problems, it is a great car with plenty of power, head room, leg room, cargo space and great gas mileage for a large and powerful vehicle. I have owned/leased two MDX's, a 2011, and a 2016. If it weren't for the touch screen interface, I would buy another MDX, but I'll get something else instead next time.

acura,mdx,2016,Michael Lester, 03/19/2019,Close but no cigar!,pos,"I purchased my MDX SH-AWD w/ Tech Pkg. from Lindsay Acura in Columbus, OH July 2018. I have owned the vehicle for nine months and it has exceeded all of my expectations in every category except the ""new for 2016"" nine speed automatic transmission. Having owned over 25 vehicles in my half century on this earth both foreign and domestic alike,  I have never experienced a transmission that shifted so abruptly in the lower gears that wasn't in need of service. In fact I took my vehicle to Lindsay Acura for service on the transmission thinking something had to be malfunctioning. I knew I was in trouble when the service adviser after hearing my complaint responded with ...""yeah this model year shifts like crap"" As wonderful as this SUV is...had I taken a longer test drive to discover how poorly the transmission shifts in the lower gears I would have never bought it and my kidneys would have thanked me! And that's too bad because otherwise this is a very nice SUV. As soon as I can trade out of the vehicle without losing my shirt that's what I'll do. I will even test drive newer MDX models to see if Acura has addressed what I consider to be a problem. And if they have I will buy another MDX in a heartbeat!

I love the new safety features like lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise, Collision mitigation braking system.. these features were not offered on a tech in 14.. has a couple issues with transmission but software update fix these problems. For the money no other SUV compares to the MDX in size, features, and price! Love the SH-AWD big improvement from the FWD and I get a spare tire! The add $2k cost are returned at trade in or resell. The 3.5 V6 great on gas and quick in changing lanes or pulling out in traffic. Information system is dated especially navigation system, but updated to Apple car play with Navtool to bring the MDX to today’s technology. Hope to keep for long term..

Salesman was very professional, courteous and  made feel like coming back for next vehicle.  Lots of things too early to rate since we have driven only 300+ miles, time will tell.   Overall  we are happy.  Too early to fuel economy rating.

Draw back is no spare tire with the pricey and luxurious vehicle.  Road free road side assistance in case of flat tire how long it will take in town and when I am on roads 100 or more miles away from nearest facility ?   It would not have cost Honda more than $ 50 dollar more  per car which consumer pays. In my judgment it is poor decision on Honda's part.

       Took the car in for routine service in may, told the about dash rattles, banging noise in the rear and the transmission hunting for gears on down hill grades. They said they had service bulletins on the shifting and the rear end noise. They reprogrammed the computer and installed new bushings in the rear suspension. The two actions made a huge inprovement in those issues.  As far as the dash rattles I found that by putting cardboard between  the passengers window  pillar and the dash the rattle was eliminated. When I took it in the dealer they removed the unsightly cardboard and replaced it with foam tape. Looks much better and the rattles are gone.

acura,mdx,2016,David, 10/12/2016,Jerky low speed transmission shifts,neu,"Rough shifting from idle into first and second. Jerky shifting at low speed if you do not accelerate uniformly.  Not worth the $50K+ price.

The funny thing is after reading all these reviews I see that I am not the only one having issues.   My problem only happened after a few thousand miles.  It dd not do this in the beginning.

acura,mdx,2016,MDXINTX, 08/06/2015,Transmission problems,neg,"After 1000 miles the new 9 speed transmission can't figure out what gear to use at low speed (< 40 MPH). The ride is jerky or the car surges. The dealership is aware of the problem, but solution not available. Also the memory seat/steering doesn't always return to the set drivers position and the navigation system worked correctly 1 out of 4 attempts. Knowing what I know now, I would not get this car.  UPDATE...after the recall to installing the transmission warmer the car does not seem as jerky as it once was.  However, even with this change, I would not recommend this car. I just sold this car and couldn't be happier.  I had forgotten how a car should drive, it proves the Acura was just terrible.

acura,mdx,2016,Jerry M, 07/10/2016,Not what I had expected.,pos,"After owning Hondas for over 30 years and a 2004 Honda Pilot for the past 13; I decided I was going to get myself a luxury SUV. Given my happiness with Honda vehicles, I always assumed it would be an Acura MDX. After taking it for a test drive I have nothing really bad to say about the vehicle, only that it looked and drove like a very, very nice Honda, but not what anyone would consider a luxury vehicle. It lacked the plusher interior as well as the driving enjoyment that one would expect from a luxury car (at what what still a luxury price). As a matter of fact, I also test drove a completely decked out 2016 Honda Pilot Elite and found that other than being even bigger tan the Acura offered similar features at a lower price.

The shifting quality is poor to say the least and the bang shifting it does every so often just to make sure your a wake is a nice touch. But the worst part of all is the Acura is not owning up to these problems and say that is the way these vehicles operate. So I say to them put that in your advertising.

acura,mdx,2016,Romario, 04/12/2019,Love your family? Consider other choices!!!,neg,"First of all, this review is 100% personal opinion and experience. I don't want to hurt anyone feelings and passions for this car. I would not review Acura as a brand and its corporate customer relations, dealership or service as I never had worse. This is separate review on different site. At the beginning as I was buying used car and wanted to be on the safe side, so paid few thousands more and purchased ""certified"" car with couple hundreds of points of inspection. Picked up car from dealership clean and shiny but unfortunately at night time. Next day found broken door handle, water on the passenger seat floor like after flood and as a bonus transmission which feels like doesn't know what to do with the engine and stupid driver actions. Next day everything was complained to the dealer and the fun started. Door handle was fixed after first visit to the service, water on the floor only after 2d visit (they thought I will not check it?!), transmission was “software” updated during both visits, which made it act worse. 3d and 4th visit for transmission issues left without any attention only with comments ""it is Acura's design"". At the end of January when we had a week of temperatures lower than -20F I had 2 situations which didn't turn into fatal accidents only by miracle. While starting from stop position transmission just fully refused to provide traction/torque to the wheels for few seconds. So, imagine that you want to speed up in front of the truck, push the accelerator to the floor and everything you get is just 6-7 thousand RPM without any movement. Then a kick to 2d gear and slow movement. Thanks God other drivers were experienced and had time to brake in and not smash me to the ground. This was the last straw. I filed a complaint with State General Attorney and NHTSA, 7 weeks passed and there is no solution or any proposal from dealership or Acura, next step is arbitration and BBB complaint procedure. My car is 100% not safe to drive (at least for me and my family)! So, why do you need all these myriad of airbags and line assistants if one day truck will just make you flat? I regret I didn’t read reviews on this car before purchase to find out that every second complaint is about the transmission. I would never think that luxury brand can have such a huge technical problem called “Manufacturer’s design”. 
The overall feelings about the car are about average - panel plastic is cheap, and you have no feeling you sit in luxury car. I would say just good quality of a regular brand. I had Chinese and Soviet Union cars in my life, so I know how really cheap plastic feels. Back up camera is a joke as it feels I put glasses with blur lenses. Audio quality is decent but quite poor for “luxury” brand. Cargo area is small for this size of SUV. 2d row doesn’t fold completely. No fog lights (only as an option in 21st century!). Driver seat and wheel memory settings are not always return to its memorized position. You cannot drive with open door. One more not safe feature - car is locking with the key fob inside! I had my 4 years locked in the car with key inside. Thanks God it was not hot or extremely cold and we were able to unlock the door within few minutes with alarm went off. But if there were nobody inside I would just have to break in or go home for 2d key fob. 
There are some positive moments. Dynamic in sport mode is quite impressing (even with the kicks). Actually, it is only one positive moment I can recall. But who needs it in family SUV? I would be more worried about MPG which never was better than 20. 
Will try to update review within the further process.

Part 2. 6 months later.
Transmission was replaced to the new one. Acura ""design"" with jerks and slips confirmed. Car returned to dealership for trade in. Thanks to the outstanding new general manager trade in value was more than reasonable - 98%. Traded in for Lexus,
 no complaints, only praises and admiration. Goodbye and Good luck Acura, thanks for such useful experience!

acura,mdx,2016,BLopez, 11/03/2017,Infinity to Acura a different story,neg,"I was in a journey in 2016 looking for a new car since I changed it every 3 years, I delayed the decision a little bit because I love the Infinity JX35 car performance including the outstanding customer service I received throughout all this years while doing the car maintenance. After doing a lot of research I decided to change to this vehicle and for my surprise the car stopped itself in the middle of a drive thru creating a chaos at the fast food lane and all the people shouting how a new car doesn't move. After the journey to move the car to the Customer Service facility, a couple of weeks to determine what happened, without a courtesy car...they communicate that for my surprise it was the transmission computer that had issues and after two months I am paying the car without having it back at home. I am concern more with the consequences of having another situation in a more risky situation when I understand that might be a safety issue... Bottom line, totally disappointed with the car, I do not recommend this brand and customer service far away from the one received by Infinity.  I do not recommend this brand by any chance.

acura,mdx,2016,bonofca, 08/28/2015,A sensible choice for a luxury crossover,pos,"Purchased my MDX'16 (SH-AWD Adv/ Ent.) 3 months ago. So far so good. Great handling, smooth riding SUV. Quiet and comfortable on the road. Very responsive in sports mode. The infotainment system was not simple to use at first, but when I learned how to use it, I really like it because of its cool advance tech. features. Great sound system. Excellent Rear entertainment system with wide screen that produces a surround sound quality similar to a high end home theater system. Safety features are probably one of the best in it's class. The adaptive cruise control/ lane keep assist are great feature on long drives.

Follow up review: after 9 months. So far so good, still an excellent vehicle. no major issues. I really like the push button shifter. Contrary to some reviewers complaint, doing a three point turn is an easy step for me: put the hand over the gear selectors, pull the reverse button to back up with the index and middle finger, push the drive button with the thumb to forward, no arm travel is needed. One minor issue is the back up camera was slow to respond. 
Just like some of the reviewers here in the site, I also noticed that ocassionally, the drive in lower gear is not smooth particularly in sports mode, but it's not a big deal, for me it has similar feel when driving a manual trabsmission car at 1st gear.
Highway mpg is spot on, 26-28 in long drives at 60-70 mph on a flat road. City is around 19-20.
The lane keep assist can keep up at 45-65 mph when there is a clear lane marking, at >75mph, I noticed that the car gets too close to the next lane when going on a curvy free way. Adaptive cruise works well in my car but can slam on brakes a bit hard in some occasions particularly when there is a slowing down of traffic in front of you. Not quite as smooth as a human driver braking.
To me, the dual infotainment system is cool and high tech looking especially now that I'm used to it, but could still be improved to a nicer, faster, HD graphics. I wish Acura could come up with software upgrades in the future.

acura,mdx,2016,Michael, 04/28/2016,Can't hear the music,neu,"Loved the RDX and followed with the MDX. Mistake. From cold start the car takes a few seconds to download (or open) its software and the initial start is ""jerky"". The transmission/pick-up is initially slow. But the one awful feature is the radio- It has been to the dealer to check all connections-claims to have found none which I believe since the radio still cannot hold a station. Every station wanders/gets static. Think this is the worst car radio I've had since I was a kid in my father's 1958 Dodge.

acura,mdx,2016,Mike S, 08/25/2016,Second MDX is disappointing,neu,"I traded my 2013 Acura MDM in for a 2016 and am very disappointed in the new car's transmission.  It is very clunky and shifts in and out of gears unnecessarily.  Based on the transmission alone, I would not recommend this vehicle.  The old transmission was a 6 speed and was much smoother than the current 9 speed.  At highway speeds it is fine, but in ordinary city stop/go traffic it is not.  I do like the lane change warnings and the warnings that you get when you are backing up that another car is approaching from the sides.  This is very helpful when pulling out of a parking space when another truck or SUV is next to you.  The car informs you someone is coming before you can actually see the oncoming car.  Very nice feature!  I wish Acura would offer a HUD, I have one on a BMW and it is another feature that once you have, you don't ever want to give up.  The navigation system display is not very well done and the software it uses is not very efficient, also much better on my BMW.  All-in-all, I would rather have my old MDX back.

When an update becomes available, be prepared to pay $145 or more plus tax & shipping for the software.  My concern is traveling outside of my hometown to places that have updated their roads.  Unfortunately for the amount of money spend for this vehicle, you CANNOT rely on the navigation map system.  I purchased my vehicle in June 2015 and today (9/13/16) I contacted Honda Navigation System and was told there is no information about a forth coming update to the navigation map system.

My only two complaints: the transmission is a bit sluggish (took it in and they did an update, but don't really notice a difference) and the GPS is absolutely horrible. I am very disappointed that, after spending $50k on a brand new car - a car where, btw, the GPS is not standard (included in the technology package, which I have) - the GPS is utterly substandard. Not only is it slow, it takes 5 minutes to enter in an address, and half the time it is just plain WRONG. Very frustrating. I have to use my Garmin because it is so worthless.

acura,mdx,2016,Ben, 09/24/2019,"Good overall, small problems",pos,"I have owned my MDX for a little over a year. Just turned 60,000 miles. Overall this SUV has been solid. Rear struts were replaced under warranty (rattle from rear). My front left strut is squeaking when making a hard turn  so will need to be addressed soon. Engine has been very solid and has decent fuel economy for the size (24mpg average). Transmission takes time to learn. It tends to lag or gear search when you accelerate abruptly. Once it is going, it will take off. AWD system is amazing and has never let me down in snow or light off roading. Maintenance cost is very reasonable my average oil change and tire rotation at dealer is $58.00 after taxes. All other items are fairly priced. Third row is small and really only for kids. 

My only real complaint is the dual screen infotainment. Takes a while to learn. I wish it had a physical button for family control like the temperature settings. Back up camera is grainy but not terrible compared to other cars in 2016. "
acura,mdx,2016,Raghu, 03/22/2016,Awsome car!!,pos,"2016 Acura MDX SH-AWD with Technology and Entertainment package has been very good so far: 
My overall experience with Autonation, Stevens Creek has also been very good, very friendly staff.
The salesman Mr Allen Kim was very helpful so does the finance person Mr Christian.
If you happen to decide to buy Acura buy it from Autonation, Stevens Creek and ask for Allen Kim.

The car itself is very spacious, nice / plush interiors and I like the push-button gear shift once I got used to this.
+Good Performance
+Overall comfort
+Excellent safety
+120V AC supply in the rear console is very good and handy on the go.
Cons:
-Cruise control is not as smooth and speed is not constant when the roads have elevation.
-Navigation is slow/un-intuitive.
-Glove box illumination works only when the engine is ON
-Third row leg space is okay for kids and bit jammed for adults but for the price/size, I guess this is okay.

I was also considering Audi Q7 but I think I made a good decision to stick with Acura MDX due to its looks and features.
Few things Acura could improve further, given that this is the ""Entertainment package"" trim:
1. USB port could also have supported the rear video playback (ex: AVI/MP4)
2. Similarly, instead of decade old audio/video jack ports in the rear video in/out, they could have included the HDMI port or maybe another USB port.
3. Could have included the BluRay disk drive instead of the previous/old generation DVD optical drive for the rear video playback
4. I hope / expect to see if Acura could fix or improve any of these and also consider adding ""Car Play"" integration in forthcoming firmware upgrade.

acura,mdx,2016,Dan Anelli, 04/10/2016,New MDX purchase,pos,"There is a touch of lag from hitting the gas pedal to kicking in - but once kicked in it really goes!

Turning radius is  a bit large and difficult to judge turn into tight places.  I find myself re-parking to get in between the stripes in parking lots quite often

Required oil changes are few.  I purchased a maintenance plan/extended warranty but it really wasn't needed

The built in GPS is poor, even when updated (which is expensive).  Google does a much better job and I rarely use the included GPS

Been 3 or 4 years owning it now without ANY unscheduled service needed.  Just doing as the reminders tell me to do and it runs like new.  Of course, I am retired, so not really putting on the miles

My first time owning an MDX, the jewel lights are great.  I am a little annoyed by the dull hum when you turn the steering wheel.  The service guy says that is how it is made.  I did not hear it in the other vehicles.  The controls screen HAVE to be UPDATED to include a single button to change air circulation, when you see some exhaust and dusts you have to scramble to find the control and press TWO BUTTONS to change to recycle.  I am able to get by just putting the car in AUTO for AC.  You have to press TWO BUTTONS to turn on and off AC!
"
acura,mdx,2016,Joseph, 11/20/2017,ACURA NEVER AGAIN!,neg,"There is a very big problem on shifting gears just seconds after you change. A ""bucking"" motion occurs as you drive, jerking the car and happens every time you stop and start your car on the road. It's as if you're driving a stick shift and you did not remove the clutch in time. Awful feeling, not reliable. The Acura dealership said ""yes we know there is a problem with the transmission- there is no current solution, you gotta live with it."" Another big problem is the technology package- phone connection with calls and messaging are full of glitches and now my messaging abilities do not even work (reading out loud or sending them by speaking to the car). Acura dealership also says they have no updates for these problems. After spending close to $60,000 for a ""luxury"" automobile, it is very unfortunate that the Acura company gets your money and runs.also  if you get a text ,  Anytime you change the shift, if your parking going back-and-forth it keeps repeating text to you. Finding the contact also impossible, It gives 56 different options. And when I took it to the dealership they tell me there is no update on the technology.

acura,mdx,2016,2016MDXer, 02/17/2020,I love Acura,pos,"I love Acura as a brand so when I saw the modest reviews on my new/used car I figured something must not be quite right. Well, maybe some of you favor a less drastic shifting experience and a little less clunk from your transmission lol, but as a primary Acura driver, these are things I’ve learned to cope with. Quality of interior, suspension and engine are top of the line. Yes the 9 speed creates even more woes from the Acura transmission but the 6 speed was no less jerky in my opinion, it’s something that either you or the transmission software will adjust to over time with more use. Acceleration complaints from this car are questionable as I’ve learned in sport mode this thing takes off like a beast but in comfort mode the shifts are very sluggish so expect that when darting in and out of traffic like a mad person. If that’s how you drive I suggest sport mode as your primary driver setting. Other than that, typical Acura, fine leather interior, snappy infotainment with more buttons than necessary, seemingly reliable and comfortable. Try your luck, you just might fall in love.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Jeff, 06/20/2020,Still happy after 4 years,pos,"We bought this car new and have now had it for four years. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because it does all the important stuff excellently, there have been no surprises, and the only negatives are small items.  
The car has been 100% reliable with no service required other than the regularly scheduled oil changes, etc. which the Acura dealer does at a very reasonable price.  Typical for Honda vehicles (we have owned Hondas or Acuras for over 25 years).  The push button, 9 speed automatic transmission took a bit of getting used to at first, but my wife and I are fine with it now.  The advantages are peppy acceleration and great highway gas mileage (27 MPG at 75 MPH you are still at under 2,000 RPM).  The only disadvantage is around town there's a lot of shifting going on, but that's just something we don't notice any more. I have had no service issues that required dealer attention.  Compared to the 7 speed, 2015 Mercedes ML 350, which I also own, the Acura feels much more nimble around town, and the Merc gets around 23 MPG on the highway. 
The MDX performs well fully loaded.  Even with 5 adults, luggage, bikes and Thule box on the roof, and a fully loaded trailer hitch too, have still gotten better than 20 MPG highway.  Have also towed a light trailer which worked great. 
For the exterior/body, the headlights are great, super bright (the Mercedes halogens are like birthday candles by comparison), the ride height is just right where it's still easy for everyone in the family to get in and out.  I am not a fan of the beak grill style. The interior configuration is good, although I would have appreciated a higher opening in the rear hatch to carry large, tall items.  For max storage space, with all the seats folded down (including the 2nd row): the width is the same as the Merc, and the Merc gives you about 5 inches more height, but the MDX gives you about 5 inches more length.  The MDX has the storage well in the back which is nicer, so the groceries aren't tipping over and sliding around in the back.
I only have a few complaints about the MDX. I personally prefer a very firm driver's seat with a bottom cushion that I can adjust to be flat.  Just my personal preference but on the MDX the bottom cushion (even with adjustment) tilts back, so I use an additional booster seat cushion.  Also I am not a fan of having the touch screens for so much of the controls.  The shift buttons are fine, just took some getting used to.
Overall we are very happy with this MDX and plan to keep it a long time.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Drake Sliver, 12/09/2020,Super AWD,pos,"Plenty of room, fantastic handling and traction in snow and all wet roads. Very quiet interior due to the acoustic glass. Firm but comfortable ride and lots of power from the V-6. MPG on highway as high as 28 mpg if driven sensibly."
acura,mdx,2017,Justin, 01/06/2017,Great car!,pos,"I cross shopped multiple vehicles prior to purchasing this SUV. My wife and I sat in and drove many SUVs. We felt like this SUV offered a lot more than the others for the price. The biggest/best surprise is the SH-AWD (google torque vectoring if you haven't already) which makes the car a lot of fun to drive and adds a spare tire. The ELS sound system is great. The safety features should be standard on all vehicles -- the technology package adds the blind spot detection which is awesome. I was worried that the transmission would at least take some getting used to given the complaints but it's great actually. Their are plenty of YouTube videos explaining why it feels a little funny between 2 gears but I have honestly not had a problem in any IDS mode (sport, comfort, normal). The complaints don't seem to be primarily regarding reliability. I was also worried I wouldn't like the shifter after so many complaints. It is actually very easy to use and keeps me from ever having to look down. It has the added benefit of protecting you from changing gears when you shouldn't (i.e. P while driving, D while shutting off the engine, etc...) which ultimately saves wear on your transmission. Good warranty compared to the other SUVs (7 years on the drive train). The infotainment system is just ok even with the tech package but has all of the functionality I need. I wish that it had a panoramic sunroof. If you compare to other vehicles in the class, for example the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 etc.. or even the Pilot, Pathfinder, Highlander, and Forester, I thought the Acura was ultimately the best bang for your buck.

acura,mdx,2017,RG, 12/01/2016,Great relief!!!,pos,"I've owned it for about a month and from all my experiences so far, I'm very impressed with quality of interior as well as luxury feel of the car. I've driven German cars for the last 5 years and decided to go back to old reliable Japanese-made cars and couldn't be more relieved. After spending a ridiculous amount for maintenance on my 328 iX Drive, looking forward to owning this car and not worrying about the next pothole or the next maintenance project that will cost thousands of dollars.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Anthony, 11/14/2016,"Best of all car's I've owned, including S500",pos,"Overall, an excellent piece of engineering and design. It's not 100% perfect on design, but it's pretty darn close.  Let me summarize simply with Pro's and Con's. PRO'S are: Awesome handling with SH-AWD, I mean really awesome. Just about as good as my E92 M3, I totally mean that, for all intents and purposes on the street. The semi-autonomous driving features are great. The Lane Keeping system, the Adaptive Cruise Control with Follow, Blind spot warning, all make it ALOT safer to drive in these days of distracted driving. You must study the functionality of each system to know when you can and should not rely on them. But overall I find them productive and adding to safety for me and those around me. Comfort is 8.5 of 10. Seats are not super duper, but definitely more than acceptable. You can customize the crap out of all the systems, and if you read the 500 page manual like I did, you will be amazed at what this car can do. Walk away auto locking system is quite nice. WIth the right setup in the menu, you never, ever have to take the key out of your pocket/purse. Just walk in, walk out, the car does exactly what you want, when you want it, and you just never touch a button on the remote, EVER.  Worried about the car being locked? You can send it a message via your remote, querying the lock status, and I've tested that at 100 yards remote distance, no problem! Engine is satisfactory - it ain't a Porsche, BMW, but it gets the job done. The 9 spd tranny does fine! All these complaints about transmission hunting around for a gear, but I have not noticed it.  Auto engine stop awesome, auto brake hold system awesome. Headlights are freaking amazing, SO BRIGHT.  Sound system is 8.5/10. I have heard better, but this is totally fine. Mileage is pretty darn good, on a freeway going about 65  you can easily get 25mpg if not closer to 28-29mpg. CON'S: the navigation system sort of sucks, compared to Google Maps. You can't beat Google with it's machine learning and real-time mobile updates on traffic etc. Plus the processor powering the Nav and the Phone menus is slow and outdated. But usable if you have to. One huge con is for USB flash drives, the search functionality is AWFUL, as you can only scroll the huge list of songs or folders, you cannot search by Artist, Title, etc.... If you want to bring your own music, you better have a large iPOD, in which case the Search/Selection functionality is reasonable.  OVERALL: definitely a car you will enjoy taking road trips with.

acura,mdx,2017,Michael DeWaal, 10/27/2017,"Now at 67,000 miles: As good as day 1.....",pos,"Update: Now at 67,000 miles.  Proven reliability, space for clients, luggage, our dogs, etc.  Sometimes, all at once.

On our 2nd day of ownership, we had our clients with us in Breckenridge, Colorado.  After our meetings, we decided to take them behind the resort to an old mining town site.  We had been there several times before on our own for our daily hikes with our dogs - thought it would be a perfect hike for our guests, 4 of which were runners from New Jersey (sea level, not the 10,000 feet of where we were).

They left before me on foot with my wife.  About 30 minutes in, I got a call.  It had started to snow on the ridge behind me - it was not yet snowing where I was and no one was ready for that, nor was it predicted - it's a common fault of the local weather predictions.  It started to really come down. So, I had no choice but to get in our new MDX and go rescue 5 people - dirt road first, then dirt road with heavy pockets of emptied out dirt from water flows, etc.  Toss in a few boulders and rocks, it's a good test of the SH-AWD, now on slick rocks wetted with snow, mud and some rain, on inclines in excess of 10 degrees, more so depending on where you were.  Decent control kicked in, the SUV did not slip, even with the heavy pitching and yaw angles, and I was there in about 6-7 minutes where they were.

All 5 piled in, found the back seat/3rd row access quickly and found plenty of head room for 2 adult females in the 3rd row, 2 in the middle captain's chairs and my wife sitting shotgun.  Before leaving the driveway, I turned on the captain's chairs seat heaters, the rear heater system to blow warm air all the way in the 3rd row and for the ""toe warmers"" blowing out from under the 2 front seats for the 2nd row passengers.

The ""oooo's"" and ""ahhhhhs"" expressed were the best demonstration of what the MDX can do when called upon.  Every single person was pretty impressed with the SUV's capability.

So, yes - I do recommend the MDX, hands down, over the Lexus RX350/450 and the Audi Q5 SQ5 and the Q7.

We are now 2 1/2 years into the ownership experience.  We will replace it with an updated MDX in the Fall.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Nancy, 07/14/2017,My favorite MDX so far,pos,"I've owned 2004, 2010 and now the 2017 Acura MDX.  The 2017 is an awesome car.  I looked at the Infinity QX60 and Audi Q7, and I thought the MDX drove the nicest and was the most comfortable.  The improvements between the 2010 and 2017 were many.   The handling is better, the seats are comfortable, the 4 captain  chairs are great,  the sun shield are handy,  the rear camera and views are very helpful.  I am averaging 27mpg (on the 2010 I averaged 18mpg)  I think the fit and finish is way better with the 2017 model.   The sensors work, almost too good.   I have noticed that when I'm driving back roads and have a sharp right turn and there is a vehicle is approaching at the turn, the ""brake"" sensor illuminates.   I do not mind the engine energy saving when at a complete stop, I've learned to anticipate when to let the foot off the brake to restart the car and continue on my way.  I was concerned about purchasing the MDX after reading some of the reviews here, and I'm so glad that made the decision to buy it.

Update:  I still own the 2017 MDX.  I still enjoy driving it.  The seating is comfortable and the controls are convenient.  The MDX is different from the previous models and I've had to change my acceleration habit to conform to this automobile.  When I accelerate, it needs to be deliberate to avoid a hesitation when start from a stopped position.  It's not a big deal and I've gotten used to it.  I still do not care for the ""brake"" sensor, but I have learned that the sensor only senses the direct line of sight, so now I've adapted my driving to help prevent the sensor from detecting a ""brake"" condition where there isn't one.  The gas mileage is much improved over the previous models, If I drive 55-58mph (speed limit) I average 31mpg and I'm happy with that.  

Update:  I've owned the MDX for 9 months and have been able  to drive it in winter conditions.  The MDX handles Michigan winters flawlessly.  I appreciate the Auto Start to warm up the car before I get in it, the seats and steering wheel are warm and toasty when it below zero outside.  The 4 captains chairs available with the Advanced package have turned out to be great.  There is more room in the 2nd row since the chairs can be adjusted and I do not feel bad having a couple sit back there because of the ample leg room.  All in all, the MDX is a great car.  I will own it for years.

acura,mdx,2017,Rajeev Kalsi, 12/01/2016,Thunder,pos,"""Thunder"" that's what we named our MDX.  That's based on the black on black combo we got. Bought it after selling our pilot (you will be missed). Anyway , the Pilot's big bro MDX is a great vehicle. I have never seen my wife more happy with a car we ever owned, than with this. On the road its calm , serene and commands a presence of its own. If the  diamond grill and 22"" wheels don't turn much heads, then the jewel eyes sure do it. It has a mind of its own even if you are feeling sleepy and it will tell you that by beeping every time you get too close to another car. Be it changing lanes or head on. Automatic braking is the most understated feature. Come to think of it, there have been times when I was driving another car and wished they had this one feature. Ample space for a family of 4 and spare seats for those once in 6 months or a year need for extra. Yes it comes with 2 memory sets of mirror and seating paired with 2 sets of keys. So when wife drives it mirror automatically set to her taste and when I do , it welcomes me with open arms and pre-adjusted seats and mirrors. Automatic liftgate, keyless car access and ambient lights give a feeling of luxury so does filling the gas tank with premium, only pinching , while drinking. That's about the only pinch though. For buyers, with remorse, who would get a touring or elite younger brother, this gives a justified peace to its owner with the fact that its just couple of thousand more than the younger sibling. It also displays authority, with the body styling, shows seriousness, with 9 speed auto and means business when compared to the touring or elites, of which it claims none but possesses both. Meanwhile I keep finding reasons to get it out of garage for every little errand. For once, no errand is small.

On calling we were told by the dealer they have no loaner cars due to airbag recall issues. Suddenly stalls and almost got my wife into a terrible accident.

acura,mdx,2017,Disappointed buyer, 03/06/2018,Transmission problems already!,neg,"I purchased a new, 2017 MDX SH AWD with technology package in February 2018 from Frankel Acura in Maryland and this has been my experience:  The salesperson, Mark was helpful.  The car had 378 miles on it when I purchased it.  Immediately after driving off the lot, I noticed the timing of the transmission seemed to be off. I was pressing the gas, however the car was hesitating and then it would shift into 1st or 2nd gear, but the shifting was rough, enough to jerk you forward when the car finally moved.  When I took the car to Frankel Acura for diagnostics and repair, I was told the vehicle was operating properly. I was also told that I would have to deal with the issue until Acura issued a software update for the transmission.  The dealership offered no further action regarding the transmission. I was also  told that once the car learned my driving habits, the transmission shifting might get better. Needless to say, I am disappointed in the performance of the vehicle and the dealership.

acura,mdx,2017,Ron Possehl, 02/10/2018,Okay but far from great!,neu,"Overall okay...but after 1 year (I wanted to wait long enough to give a fair/accurate review) my biggest issue is the 9-speed transmission.  Sadly it doesn't know which gear it belongs in.  Around town it's completely confused!  For that reason this will most likely be my last MDX...very disappointed....the pleasure is gone! I am already looking to see what my next SUV will be.  This is my third MDX but can't believe Acura could put out such a dud/poor quality to save a couple MPG.  My wife has a 2016 Highlander Limited that performs circles around my luxury MDX.

acura,mdx,2017,Chuck, 12/12/2016,Much improved over 2014 MDX,pos,"The styling, handling, and safety features are the biggest improvement over previous models.  The addition of the chrome to a black MDX makes it look sharp.  The added safety features are vastly improved. The tranny could be a little smoother. Pairing an android phone can be a tricky situation.  Overall a very good choice for a family or if you need cargo space. Set your cruise control to normal instead of adaptive and set your tranny to sport mode to improve your driving comfort.

acura,mdx,2017,Jake, 08/21/2017,Entirely Different MDX!!,pos,"This is my 5th MDX- 2003, 06, 11, 16, 17. I had a 2016 w/Tech. Hated it!! Loved my others. The transmission and brakes were horrible!! I should have kept my 2011. But with the help of my dealer, I was able to trade in my leased 2016 for a 2017 Hybrid w/Advance. (I test drove it a month earlier when it was released to dealerships.) Totally different vehicle! This hybrid is what I expected in a petrol MDX. The system is SUPER quiet and seamless. Actually have more power (torque wise) than my 2016. The technology of the Hybrid is nothing short of spectacular! Smooth, quiet, powerful, and informative. Has a cool information screen to tell u what system is working and which is charging the battery! The suspension and brakes are also different from the standard MDX. Much smoother with the adaptive dampers and the brake travel is firm with a short throw. When having my Hybrid accessorized I had a MDX w/Advance loaner. Now I could actually do a comparison. Unfortunately it drove like my 2016 with the exception of stop/start feature which was an annoyance. In the Hybrid, the system works the same way EXCEPT when u accelerate you are actually on electric motors THEN the motor starts seamlessly. By the way it doesn't use a conventional starter! The front electric motor IS the starter! How cool is that. AND when driving you would never know when the engine is on or off unless you are looking at the tachometer! Even when you initially start the vehicle you can barely hear it. And the gas mileage is EXACTLY as advertised- 26.6 city/27-28 highway so far. I cannot see anyone who tests drives BOTH vehicles to not go with the Hybrid. It's only $1500 more than a comparable equipped MDX. The best bargain I have ever seen for this much technology (and I am a tech guy)! Out of the 21 vehicles I have owned since 1965 this by far the BEST vehicle I have ever had!! And that includes 2 sports cars that I loved!! Only one real drawback, Acura is no longer including a spare tire kit so I had to purchase one. One day Acura may only be making Hybrids (so far RLX, NSX, MDX). But for a newly introduced vehicle to the market, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!

acura,mdx,2017,Jennifer Penley, 11/14/2017,Big connectivity issues,pos,"I love this vehicle overall, except for two main areas:  one of which I knew about before I purchased it, and the other of which I didn't discover until after.  The vehicle is pretty much top notch in all categories but it doesn't necessarily scream luxury on the inside.  It is definitely very well appointed but I was hoping for just a bit more of a luxurious feeling on the inside.  That's the negative I knew about and purchased the car anyway.  The other negative about this vehicle is the clunkiness of the technology (which I guess if I'd test driven it for more than 15 minutes I might have eventually discovered) and the fact that the iPhone connectivity is poor (which I didn't know until after the fact).  All menu and sub-menu options are toggled to and selected via a main dial that's about as big as the channel dial on a very old television, and there's a small bit of lag between pressing/turning the dial and the system responding.  In addition, and even more bothersome, is the fact that iphone contacts do not seamlessly synchronize via Bluetooth.  I have hundreds of contacts in my phone, and only about 5 of them synchronize.  After wondering what the heck I was doing wrong because I just couldn't get my contacts to synchronize - in addition to the voice command system not properly recognizing prompts - I turned to Google and, alas, found forum after forum of other MDXers complaining about this very same issue for years now.  In the end, I'd still probably have purchased this vehicle because it was the highest rated for safety in this vehicle class by IIHS and NHTSA, and safety is my number 1 criterion when I purchase a vehicle, but I might not have opted for the Tech package if I'd have been aware of these issues.  Another disappointment is the fact that the AcuraLink app doesn't have functionality to remotely start the car, yet it can remotely lock & unlock doors.  That ability/convenience would be a small luxury that would go a long way.

While the 2015 was a fine vehicle I was pleased to see some cosmetic changes  for 2017 to grille and headlamps as well as making more features standard like lane warning departure. It has the push button shifter which takes a little getting used to but has been fine. Last night the honeymoon came to a very short stop.The vehicle began bucking and shaking and then all the dashboard lights came on! Engine failure; brake failure; the sound system was going on and off by itself. The a/c would go on and off and the seats started shifting. When I pulled into my driveway I couldn't shut the car off. When I finally did, the sound system came back on. Dealer told me that they were having problems with the vehicle and needless to say, I will be driving the dealers loaner for a while. I'm hoping for a positive outcome but I have serious concerns. No bashing of the Acura brand as I like and respect it.Lets see how they repair it and what the outcome is.

acura,mdx,2017,One Driver, 07/14/2017,2017 MDX transmission safety nightmare,neg,"My brand new MDX almost killed me yesterday. It drove jerky from day one. It is not just ""me getting used to a 9-speed transmission"" like the dealer is telling me. It does shift jerky and frequently slows down independent of what I am doing on the gas or brake. Will occasionally jerk strongly and repeatedly like it is about to stall when driving 35mph for several miles with no need for gears to shift at all. I took it back to dealer within 2-3 weeks of purchase. They claimed could find nothing wrong. It continued as before and before I could get back to the dealer a week or so later this happened: Stuck in stop and go highway traffic for half hour. Every press on the gas was herky jerky but suddenly when traffic finally started to move freely, a press on the gas produced nothing but RPM's revving. I took my foot off the gas and tried again 2-3 times. I put on my flashers and barely rolled to the shoulder through the swerving traffic. I turned off the car and restarted to make my way jerkily back home. Second trip to dealer is so far producing the same bs that they can find no problem. I just found several stories online of same problem. Unless they fix this I am not driving this death machine.

It is a 9 speed transmission versus previous 6 speed transmissions and will accelerate and surge forward without you increasing the gas pedal. My previous 2011 MDX was smooth and the transmission never gave me a problem. Acura dealership is aware of this and referred me to the Acura Client Relationship 800# but no fix is planned or recall on this car. Beware you may rear end someone when the car lurches forward.

I only noticed this after getting delivery of the car. The dealership did their best to adjust the door and it is better than when first delivered but after a months the door is back to looking bad. The fuel door appears not closed!  That said, each time I walk up to the car, I see that the door is not sitting flush. I contacted client relations and they said they can't change the design at this point and nothing they can do. So,  if quality is what you like. perhaps you should take a 2nd look at the fuel door. I am not at all happy with the answer from Acura client Relations nor the dealership knowingly selling this car with this problem. 
I connected with 80+ 2017 Acura MDX Owners on Facebook and several others stated a similar problem. Acura has not bothered to notice these social posts but they don't hesitate to solicit new owners for feedback on the quality of the car. I reply to all the surveys and restated my issue. Still no acknowledgement. $50k for a car and lip service from Acura.

acura,mdx,2017,Joe, 10/10/2016,Is this really a Honda,neg,"Before you buy this car, try the electronic system with the caveats below

I have been a loyal buyer of Honda cars for years. However this will be my last purchase from them. I have an 2017 MDX. The GPS and entertainment system is unusable. Don't take my word for it try it before you think about a purchase.

GPS does not work- If you try take a different turn then directed on the route, most GPS is will recalculate and redirect you. Not this system. They have made a design change where the GPS will actually direct you off the road. Apparently my dealer tells me that they know about the problem for a long time and hoping for a fix. 

The car does not allow you to cancel the route as you are driving.

The voice activated commands absent do not work. Dealer says they know about this. They tell you not to use the voice activated system.

The dealer tells me that the MDX system is not entertainment compatible with iPhone (somewhat odd given their popularity).

acura,mdx,2017,Tony, 09/06/2017,Hybrid MDX - the MDX to buy,pos,"We were looking to replace my wife's 2010 Pilot with something modern and a bit smaller (as we didn't need as much space anymore). She wanted something with an interesting design, high quality and would be fun to drive. Kids asked for second row captain chairs with heating. 3-rd row would also be nice to have, since we occasionally need more than 4 people in a car. And finally, we needed an SUV comfortable enough to handle our long family trips. Besides comfortable seats, it had to have driver-assistance capabilities to reduce driver's fatigue. The budget was around $65K. When we started putting together a list of models we wanted to check out, my wife mentioned that one BMW is more than enough for our garage (my 01' M-roadster), so she'd exclude x5/x6 right away. Over the course of 2 weekends of dealership visits, the following options were rejected: Cayenne (only 2-row seating, pricey fun-to-drive models), Macan (just too small), MB GLE (didn't like overall philosophy), Jag F-pace (seating config, compromised rear-seat comfort due to its sedan-based platform), Model X (fabulous car, but way above the budget), Lexus RX (liked the interior and design, but non-heated and somewhat cramped 2-nd row). As such, MDX and Lexus GX were short-listed for test drives. Initially, we tested a gasoline version of MDX (sh-awd). My wife's impression about it was ""safe and boring"". I think it's because of the transmission on the gasoline model, which takes it's time to decide which gear would be better to use right now, considering a few dozen of factors, which probably include speed, inclination, ambient temperature, recent driving pattern, weather on Mars etc. etc. All this, while you have a really small window in traffic to merge into. Our Pilot was way better in such cases. I asked the sales guy to call me when they get a hybrid version, since I knew it should behave differently in that sense. My wife was excited to test the GX because she preferred its design and interior, due to some reason. Her impression after driving it was: ok on a straight, but so horrible even in moderate curves that it wasn't safe. We decided to wait for the hybrid MDX and keep the Pilot for another year or two in case we didn't like it. When the test car arrived a few weeks later, it exceeded our expectations. For $1500 premium you get two major improvements over the gas AWD version: the Acura's hybrid drive with dual-clutch transmission and the adaptive suspension. The former makes the acceleration faster and much smoother, while the latter allows configuring it for agility or comfort, depending on the situation. As a bonus, you get an outstanding fuel economy. With a bit of knowledge of how hybrids work, it's easy to beat the EPA numbers by 1-2 mpg. If it's not your thing and you prefer active driving style (like my wife), you will get the stated 26-27 mpg. At current gas prices, $1500 extra should pay back in 3-4 years with 12K miles per year. Considering all that, the only meaningful reason of going for a non-hybrid MDX I can think of is the budget limitation only enough to get a base FWD model. FWD Tech package and especially AWD Tech and above doesn't make sense in a non-hybrid model.

I noticed the case door does't close tightly before I bought it. I thought someone opened it accidentally until the time I tried to close the door. The dealer told me then it is a manufacture problem because they saw more than one MDX like this. The dealership did their best to adjust the door and it is better. I mentioned the issue in the customer survey and then a case was opened by Acura Client Relations.  I was told they are thinking this is the characteristic of the car and have no repair solution yet. I am very disappointed with the answer from Acura client Relations.

My transmission got a code of p287a. David McDavid Acura Plano just reset the code and told me everything is fine. But I am still experiencing the same hell with this transmission and they say they cannot do anything as their diagnostic run didn't show the code again.

acura,mdx,2017,Disappointed car buyer, 12/19/2016,Nice ride but cheap backup camera,pos,"This car has a surprisingly blurry backup camera. Taken back for adjustment/replacement and the tech said ""diagnostics"" says its working fine. I asked them to use their eyeballs and look at the image and tell me its ok. They neither agreed or disagreed except to say they will replace it as a courtesy and if the camera is the same, there is nothing they can do since its an Acura issued camera. Well, it was replaced and it looks just as bad. I am relying on good old fashion eyeballs to back this car into parking. Very disappointed and frankly surprised that Acura would install such a ""behind the times"" old technology blurry camera from another decade into this high end car. I have had other cars that cost less and their cameras are far more superior and way sharper then this one. Fix the problem or recall it Acura!!! Its dangerous to rely on your blurry camera to back up. Its a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also, for this caliber of car, the steering wheel feels like hollow plastic, maneuvering with it takes some adjustment. It feels smaller then the car's handling. And it feels plastic-ky to the touch even though its wrapped with leather or pleather.

acura,mdx,2017,Jim Shone, 12/16/2017,No fix for flawed technology; A-Link to Phone book,neu,"Generally I like the vehicle, but IPhone phonebook does not download and it is evident that there is no solution.  Support from the dealer and Acura is  empathetic. The response I get from both is that Apple IOS updates are too frequent and Acura cannot react in a timely manner with a compatible fix for the A-Link system. Whatever the excuse, the feature is flawed. It is upsetting that the dealer knew connectivity was an issue as the salesperson said you can use Siri to access your address book, but did not tell the rest of the story.  MDX owners all paid for a hands free phone feature with voice activation, a common feature even in economy cars today that promotes safe driving. Acura, along with the dealer network, knew the problem existed and were glad to charge for the feature.  So what about resale value? Would you buy this car with this sort of defect?  All that said, I like most everything else about the car so I'm close to being a satisfied customer.  Waiting to see what Acura will do to resolve the issue.

This is the 4th model MDX I've owned, and as I'd expected, it's simply far and away superior to any of the others.  Pros: Hit the gas (or should it be called the hybrid) pedal and it flies off the line.  Quietest interior I've ever been in.  Steering is tight and responsive.  My kids are big fans of the second row captain's chairs.  Driver's assisting safety features (lane departure, etc.) seem top notch.  Interior features (seats, wood accents) are very nice.  Averaging 26.6 MPG so far.  Cons: not a fan of the infotainment system.  Miss the old buttons for heating and cooling seats.  Takes too long (IMHO) for rear view camera to kick in.  Had to wait over a minute yesterday for navigation menu to activate - not a big deal unless you're running late like I was.  A few minor things I'll have to get used to.  Overall I'm a huge fan of this ride.  After test-driving the competition, I'd have to say that the bang you get for your buck with the MDX made my choice a no-brainer.

acura,mdx,2017,SN Bueti, 06/25/2018,Second MDX 2017 traded 2015,pos,"2017 MDX is quite different 2015: tires are larger-9 speed transmission-finished exhaust system instead of hidden exhausts with reflectors.  The 9 speed takes a second and a half to down shift but after that it just goes through the gears.  Finished rear end similar to what is on Mercedes, a great touch.  Don't especially like the leather or shall we say 'fake-leather' interior.  Not good, and between the transmission and fake leather had to take a point off the 5 star rating.  Great paint and nice chrome accents that 2015 didn't have.  Not terrific in the snow, tires are touring, main culprit.  Nice looking grill-another reason I traded in '15 for '17.  Really like the vehicle and so do other people, that is why there are a ton of them out there!  Great lease price on tech package, again change of year model and opted for only 7500 a year as Acura rolled in the 2015 14,000 miles under, only paying $433 month for 36 months and most likely will purchase vehicle at the end of lease for only 30K!

acura,mdx,2017,Frank Drebin, 08/11/2018,Certified 2017 AWD,pos,"I bought my MDX with 4K miles  Certified from Acura.  I was all set to buy a 2018 until I saw this 2017 and saved 10K over a new one. Only difference is CarPlay in 2018 and a quicker Navigation and radio screen. (see below)  It was a service loaner vehicle so I had a few issues taken care of under warranty after purchasing.  Let's start with the pros: What's all the  fuss with the transmission? If you want better response and shifting put the car in Sports mode it makes a world of difference in performance, or use the paddle shifters on the wheel for more control. Gas mileage is about 27 on the highway. Seats in the Advance package are more comfortable than  the Technology Package. Overall very comfortable car to drive in.  Cons:  The radio and navigation is outdated and very slow.  This is where you may want a 2018 where you can use google maps for your navigation, I tunes, Spotify etc with ease and as noted the system is much quicker than 2016-2017 models.  I just couldn't justify the cost.  Only other con I can think of is that rear tailgate makes a loud beep when closing. It's so loud you may not want to use your tailgate in the early morning hours. Dealer says it's for safety and can't be turned off which seems odd because if you try to stop it from going down it goes right back up to avoid injuring anyone like a garage door which last I checked doesn't beep going down. Anyway, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  If you need high tech and a better sound system I would check out the Audi's which are up to date on the latest tech stuff for cars.

The nine-speed transmission can be a bit much on takeoff, but shifts nicely, unlike others I've driven. This model has all the safety features, including the birds-eye camera, lacking on many competitors. The power folding mirrors come in handy in the garage and at the car wash. The dual screens require a bit of getting used to, but once mastered are a great feature, especially with the navigation at eye level. On top of all that, it's a good-looking vehicle, especially since Acura replaced that ""smiley-face"" grill (it was my primary reason for avoiding so much as test-driving one). This one's a keeper!

The Hybrid was a risk I felt I was taking being a new model but so far it is a seamless transition. You wouldn't know its a hybrid other than the fact that the tachometer periodically go's to zero. Very quiet and has nice pick-up when changing lanes and entering highways. Comfortable ride and I love the new exterior design. I was never a fan of the ""bagel Cutter"". The advance rear seat package is very luxurious and tops all other vehicles in this department. One item that Acura gets poor marks on is their information systems...I don't get the criticism. These systems are all complicated yet once you learn the ropes they work great and are no problem. My wife drives a new Mercedes and its complicated at first too! So far (15000) I haven't seen super gas milage. I'm getting 28 city/hiway. This is about 8 miles more than my previous MDX Advance.

My daughter has a 2008 and it has served her well for reliability and longevity and safety and is much more comfortable seats than mine.  Having the cooling system in it makes the seats harder and smaller. No this is not a car I would say you have to have. Very disappointing.  After a year I have not changed my mind on the car.

acura,mdx,2017,Stan W., 08/02/2020,Simply Excellent,pos,"After having this car a while, I can say that my family and I absolutely love it. This would be my third Acura (second MDX), and it doesn’t disappoint. We initially toyed with getting another brand, but after haven’t test drove a few, we eventually made our way back to this car. So a few things that are often complained about: transmission and infotainment system. The transmission shifts smooth and quick for me, however there are some odds shift but that’s just simply the design of it. I recommend watching “Alex on Autos” explanation of the ZF 9 speed transmission to really get an understanding of why it shifts the way it does. Next is the infotainment system. For me it’s really easy to use, and why people are having issues understanding it, I don’t know? If you can work your iPhone or other high tech equipment, I‘m not know why this is more difficult. You want to change the heat/vent seats? Just reach up and hit two buttons on the touch screen. Want to change the source of music from Bluetooth to satellite radio? Click “source” and hit “XM radio”. Not sure the complications with it. It’s not anymore distracting than traditional buttons, but that’s just my opinion. 

If I had to nitpick this car, I’d say the adaptive cruise control can be abrupt when reacting to changing speeds on the freeway. It should be a smooth increase or decrease in speed when reacting to cars, but it seems like it accelerates or decelerates (making it drive more rough than I would like it to) quickly to maintain the set distance between your car and the one if front. 

Having said all that, I highly recommend this car for families. It’s met all my expectations of a car of this caliber and will be back again for the next model.

acura,mdx,2017,Uncle Keith, 02/07/2018,Post The Formula,neu,"FWD no longer standard.  Active suspension no longer standard.  Push button shifter awful.  Nav system not upgraded for years.  Transmission hunts and pecks.  Fit/finish not impressive.  Looks good but the quality and driving experience has headed south from prior MDX models.  Honda has lost the Acura formula.  Things like the upgraded wheels on the Advance model of the MDX can be seen on Honda Pilots an Accords.  Acura is no longer a luxury line of vehicles.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Drue Pizzino, 03/25/2018,I’m so glad I leased. Beware,neu,"First off. This 9 speed transmission is absolutely horrible. Driving on the street it does not know what gear it should be in at all and the car literally jerks back and forth as the gears shift extremely rough. Coming to a stop at a stop light the car jerks as it shifts gears down. Then stepping on the gas at a green light and be careful you don’t smash into the car in front of you as the car stumbles into 1st gear and jerks and shoots you forward into second. Then second jerks the car into third. It’s absolutely horrible and very frustrating. I leased this car brand new in December and took it to the dealer two days ago in March. The dealer told me this is normal. When I reverse I hear a loud pop as if I ran over a plastic bottle. This is every time I reverse and again the dealer told me it’s normal. The Bluetooth connectivity is a joke because nothing works besides my music in my phone. Pandora doesn’t work, text message retrieval doesn’t work, Hell most of the time it won’t connect to my phone unless I go into my phone and connect to AcuraLink. I’m very dissapointed with the mdx and Acura overall. I won’t be buying another Acura. I will go back to bmw or Mercedes maybe even Land Rover when this lease is up. Acura is supposed to be a luxury brand but from my experience with them vs my experience with Mercedes, Lexus, bmw, and Cadillac. Acura has a lot to learn about being a luxury brand. I’m highly highly dissatisfied and await for the day I return this car and get a true luxury suv with a brand that stands behind their products.

acura,mdx,2017,Ken, 10/16/2017,Think twice,neu,"The “drive” is quite nice. smooth albeit a bit firm for a luxury vehicle although mine is deemed a sport model so I guess I should expect to give a little on the comfort. The front seat is really an unfortable piece of work. Limit of adjustment and steering wheel make this a never ending quest for comfort. The firmness factor is unbearable for any drive over 30 minutes. Not suitable for a 6 ft person.  The Technology is total mess. While the world is racing to compete with advanced user interfaces like Apple and Android, for some insane reason this cludge of function is reminiscent of a Dos computer. A night time drive was out right dangerous with distraction of radio controls buried in a mess of heater, ac, seat, presets, tuning, and an array of hard buttons and knobs, each with multiple degrees of function. 6 steps required to change map orientation from North to direction of travel. ?? Are you kidding...  Fit and finish one glaring miss aligned fuel door jump out at you and the service manager said they’re all like that with no fix in site.. Overhead control panel has me constantly calling Acura link or emergency when simply trying to open the garage.  Net.. a nice platform with 1980’s implementation.  Way overpriced for this awful level of refinement. The pilot and odessey have both abandoned the two display infotainment system along with the rest of the industry.
.
Update..basically reaffirm the above but I would add the 2018 finally added CarPlay but the goofy two display has not yet caught up to the Pilot and the depreciation is far beyond disappointing. Much worse than expected.

Transmission can never decide what gear it wants to be in. They also charge a $700 upgrade for autostart. This isn't a KIA. This car also has more rattles that have to be addressed.. Shouldn't have to bring a new car in for them to fix rattling Chinese plastic. Wish we would of bought another Tahoe.

acura,mdx,2017,Rebarguy, 10/28/2018,Luxury with Missing Details,pos,"We purchased our 2017 new in August 2017 in the Black Copper Pearl exterior and Espresso interior. We've also owned a 2008 and 2012 and loved everything about these cars.  Except the Technology package does not come with a roof rack nor fog lights.  To my surprise, the dealer would not include these in my deal as the parts and labor to install were almost $2,000.00.  The fog lights alone were over $800 as the steering column has to be disassembled to install the fog light controls on a whole new turn signal lever.  The roof rack requires rails and crossbars, two separate parts that totaled $1,200.00.  They offered me an Advance for close to the same uncharge but they could not find the exterior/interior color combination in all of California.  Additionally, the vehicle would not adapt to Apple Car Play (I hear the new models now do) so we use Waze the old-fashioned way - hand held.  Other than that, it is a phenomenal vehicle.  I keep the transmission in Sport mode and the SH-AWD has me woo-hooing when we drive up to Lake Tahoe or Lake Berryessa.  And the Lane Keeping Assist Steering really does keep you within the lines, even when you take your hands off the wheel (but dash reminds you to keep your hands on after about 10 seconds).  Blind spot alerts let you know when a vehicle is passing and the cruise control has ""radar"" that will slow you down when you approach a vehicle ahead of you.  Interior storage is huge and the second row seats recline and slide back and forth.  Great features for the fussy passengers.

acura,mdx,2017,KT, 04/06/2019,"Great car, transmission needs work Acura!",pos,"We just spent close to $50,000 on a luxury SUV, and yes, I have high expectations for a vehicle of that price.  I have to say the transmission in the thing is HORRIBLE.  It shifts REALLY hard between 1st and 2nd and again between 2nd and 3rd.  It doesn’t matter if it’s cold or warm and the dealer is saying it’s our “fault” for not letting it warm up enough.  That’s crap.  It’s a poorly designed transmission.  When you go on line, you’ll find MANY others now having the same issue.  Is this the best Acura/Honda can do?  I will continue to complain every time I go in, because I want problems down the road covered, because no piece of machinery should run that rough.  The rest of the car is good.  Comfort is OK, but the interior style is outdated.  I don’t care too much though.  The rest of the car has met or exceeded our expectations, being smooth, quiet and comfortable.

From getting out of snowy situations, to literally climbing on ice, can’t forget about bogging through mud, rock crawling, and lastly jumping it, this MDX is reliable, and keeps on chugging. Based on what I’ve done, I doubt that any European competitor can do the same without repair. The acceleration is awesome, gas mileage is great, and maneuverability is also nice.

The MDX also drives like a truck and I selected a SUV that has a more sporty drive. I have teens that are now driving themselves and I don't need a third row however the middle row captain chairs make the MDX functionally a 4 person vehicle which was a negative to me.

The 2017 MDX has the lowest TCO and repairs on the 5 year average, with the best resale/residuals vs. its competitors.  This is the most capable SUV of the 3 in this price range.  Higher priced brands tend towards much higher maintenance and lower reliabilities.  I don't think they are worth their prices given that reliability metric.

The ONLY this I would improve on is the auto shifting from 1st to 2nd gear- not as smooth as it could be. The only change I would like (for me) is making the third room seating optional- would like the extra storage.  My previous vehicle was a 2015 lexus 350 which I loved.

The salesman told me that feature can be turned off in the system settings but it can not be. It can be turned off every time the vehicle is started but it’s extremely annoying do that. If that’s a feature then a tooth ache is enjoyable. I’m not sure what Honda is doing with this 9-speed transmission but it’s horrible. When I was a kid we used to make go-carts and have pulleys and belts with bailing wire holding everything together. The go-card would jump and jerk to get up to speed. And often slip and be unpredictable. That’s what this 9-speed transmission reminds me of except it’s in a $55K vehicle. Ridiculous!

I had to many issues with Air conditioning Compressor/ fans etc and it being in the shop for multiple days at a time For my liking. I liked the vehicle overall but reliability is questionable.


Reading some other reviews I can concur with, the break clicking noise when backing up, The strange distorting haze on the passenger side while looking from the driver side of windshield and vice versa. My biggest issue is the acceleration off the line. When a light turns green and you ease on the gas, it almost does nothing, and then Jerks and accelerates hard. This is enough not to want to drive especially in areas with a lot of stop and go or lights. The dash is dated but i believe it will change to what the 2019 RDX has in 2020. Make sure to get a version with SH-AWD it makes a large difference in the driving dynamics. I still think its funny how the moon roof shade is completely manual like a base model civic from the 2000's. At this price point all things should be automated. Although i'm glad for Apple Car play, it defeats the purpose when you have to use the control knob to access the functions, seems to be one of those, well here ya go type of updates.

Brought it in to the dealership, the district manager checked it, and noted all the other 2018's have the same issue, but said nothing could be done. It is a hazard to drive and see properly out that window. There service department took photos and agreed there is a problem. Now I am stuck driving this car for the next 3 years knowing that an accident could happen due to the defect that they won't correct.

acura,mdx,2018,Leo, 02/17/2018,Base SHAWD Bang for the Buck!,pos,"After researching, haggling, test driving, and repeating this process, we ended up with the 2018 MdX Base with SH AWD.  So here's the deal, after test driving all the trim levels, I decided on the base model. Reason being, it comes with all the options that you will ever need. The tech package is  advantageous if you REALLY need the blind spot monitor. However this car is very easy to drive/switch lanes and is proportioned very well. And keep in mind, tech package adds a pretty penny to the purchase price.  I had the new body X5 but was paying an arm and leg in lease payments so immediately got rid of it, meanwhile the MDX has more options and is half the price.  But going back to the car, it drives well, size is relatively small thus making it easy to drive for smaller statured people, has great utility, and actually fun to drive so long as you have the SHAWD.  The only drawback is the infotainment system. However, with the 2018's having apple carplay, it makes it bearable.  The shifter is annoying in the beginning, but easy to get used to. The Infiniti QX60 is probably the only viable competitor but to get standard options with AWD that you get in the mdx , it will drive up the price significantly. Added bonus is you get a fleet of standard safety and driver aid options with the base. If youre in the market, just go with the base model with SHAWD. Youre welcome!

acura,mdx,2018,David S., 01/04/2018,Updated Review After 2 years of Ownership,pos,"After owning a few of these MDXs, this one is the worst! My wife loves this one but I really hate all the different buttons you have to push or slide to engage everything. I hate the way the locks unlock when you walk by the car if you have your key fob on you and it does NOT lock itself back! It should only unlock or lock when I want it too!! Lane assist is annoying because you have to keep moving the wheel or it times our VERY fast, it should just stay set! Acura Navi & voice has always sucked and it still does, Acura refuses to listen to their customers & switch to Garmin. Still needs a panoramic sun roof and heads up. The front seats do not provide enough comfort under the thigh area.  This one did not come standard with all wheel drive and I really miss it but it is not worth paying the extra money they are trying to gouge you for now. Acura needs to look at how much better the rims on other MFRs look. Even the so called Acura premium wheels they up-charge for do not look that great & you should not have to pay extra to have nice wheels anyway, just put descent wheels to begin with & give us a choice of silver, black, etc. It was still the best bang for the buck and it has great utilitarian value with great layout, just wanted to point out to Acura what I want fixed or changed for the next one. If Acura would start listening to their customers and front line salesmen, they could improve in so many areas and increase sales. Our 1993 Acura Legend LS Coupe is still funner, more enjoyable, user friendly, sporty, stylish, and more comfortable than most of what they offer today and Acura really needs to find their way back. It took Acura far to long to fix the RDX. The RLX is still a dog. They ruined the TSX (we owned two) with the ugly cheap looking ILX. They did not leave any heritage in the NSX at all. Why all the no name letter meaningless prefixes?? Acura does not act on feed back and the point is proven with the bird beak error!!

acura,mdx,2018,Gary Baker, 08/27/2018,Too Many Intermittent Issues,pos,"2018 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid, Advanced Package Review

We took delivery of the vehicle in April 2018, and have had numerous problems with the vehicle since we bought it.  The advance package has the seat, steering wheel, and outside mirrors memory positioning system.  Intermittently, the steering wheel does not return to the memory position of the driver.  It stays all the way up, which is the exit vehicle position.  

I have an open report with Acura Client Relations.  I've had the vehicle at the dealer four times to correct the problem, but they say they cannot duplicate the issue.  On the fourth visit, the vehicle malfunctioned while the service writer was present, but the dealership still contended they could not confirm the issue.  Ultimately, they said Honda knows the issue is present, but in their opinion, it only malfunctions when both keys are present.  My response was that it seems unusual that Honda knowingly has a malfunction in their system, but chooses to ignore it.  Just to be clear, the issue happens whether both keys are present or whether only one key is present.

For some reason, Acura changed the way they receive traffic information for their vehicles.  Acura now uses HD Radio signals to receive traffic information for the 2018 MDX.  I would assume Acura uses HD Radio signals for all their vehicles.  The problem is, unless you're in a major metropolitan area, you do not get traffic information.  As a result, when you are driving in heavy traffic, the navigation does not reroute you around heavy traffic.  I have a 2016 Acura RDX, and the traffic flow works fine.  I believe Acura used to use some sort of satellite signals to receive the information, but for some reason changed to HD Radio signals.  Whatever happened to ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it""!

I've had multiple other intermittent issues with the vehicle as well.  Sometimes I have to press the Reverse button several times before the car actually shifts into gear.  When accelerating normally, the transmission seems to stay in lower gears for a long time, and the engine stays at 3,500 to 4,000 RPM, even though you are at a constant speed.  For some reason, I started getting between 16 and 17 mpg, which is what prompted my inquiring about the proper operation of the climate control system.  Then all of a sudden, I started getting what I was accustomed to seeing.  

Acura Owners Manuals are horrible.  Because of the drastic mpg variance, I've been trying to figure out the Climate Control system.  I have had open dialog with the salesman who sold me the car for over a month.  Apparently Acura sales and technical personnel don't know how the climate control system works either.  No one has contacted me with some sort of information for over a month.  

The MDX Sport Hybrid is actually a nice car.  Very quiet and smooth riding.  Their estimated fuel efficiency is a little off though.  I can get about 25 mpg on the highway, and around 21 mpg city.  Overall I get about 22 mpg.  We traded in our 2010 Lexus 450H, which is a Hybrid as well, for the MDX.  We got around 30 mpg highway and 23 city with the Lexus, and overall we got 25 mpg from the day we bought it until we traded it in.

The open case with their Client Relations has been a challenge since I opened it five weeks ago, July 17th.  From July 19th until July 25th, I left voicemail messages on the case managers direct line, and never got a call back.  When she finally did call me back July 25th, she claimed she never received any of my messages.  Apparently their phone system at Honda also has intermittent problems.  When last I talked to the case manager on August 8th, she told me she would be back in touch with me by August 10th.  That is the last I've heard from her, and today is August 26th.  I guess it must be another intermittent problem.

It's hard for me to understand why Honda/Acura has such lousy
 customer service.  Starting with their sales staff, to their service department, right up to their Client Relations.  When you spend $60,000.00 for a luxury vehicle, I would think the manufacture would be more concerned about their customers.

Been to dealer couple of times- they acknowledged the issue but no solution.  I am told it is a new feature of this model. The sound is very annoying to me and unfortunately Acura can’t fix it.  Very sad! Contacted Acura USA- same answer.

acura,mdx,2018,Charlie N., 02/06/2018,This is our second MDX,pos,"Love this car.  Love the transmission.  Love the gas mileage on the freeway.  Love the night time visibility with the LED lights.  I have owned this car now for a little over 2 months and put about 5.5k on it.  The trans has 9 speeds.  It has drive, sport and manual via paddle shifters.   I like using the sport mode going down hill and  when I really need to get up and go.  Put it in sport at a stop light and it is a rocket ship taking off.  O.K. not a Tesla, but for as big as it is it gets up and goes.  I haven't driven up to Tahoe yet so I can't say how it performs climbing the hills.  If it is anything like the previous 2004 MDX, I am sure it will do great.  I am happy with the gas mileage on the freeway.  I have achieved 25 mpg at 75 mph.  That is on the flat.  City mileage is around 16 to 18 mpg.  I love the LED headlights.  I don't like that the headlights do not self adjust when the car is loaded.  For the price and that it is the Advanced Package, Acura should have installed load sensors and headlight adjustment motors.  On coming traffic really does not like to be blinded by LED lights.  That is a big letdown in my opinion for a '17 SUV.   I am not real happy with the voice activation everything.  It is very clunky, does not understand your voice and very slow.  If you have not memorized the commands it will just frustrate the hell out of you.  I also don't like the little upper screen and the very grainy picture for parking assist.  My '04 MDX with the rear view camera had a more clear, crisp picture.  I don't like that I couldn't get 18"" or 19"" wheels.  They are 20"" and are not low profile tires or run-flats.  I wanted a smaller wheel so it won't bend so easily when you hit a pot hole.  Aluminum wheels bend easy and are really, really expensive to replace.   I am not real happy with the active cruise control.  I was zooming along at 75 mph the other day with the car in front of me going the same speed.  We were in the middle lane of a three line freeway.  A car from the fast lane decided it want to be in the far right lane.  With no blinker, they moved between me and the car in front and then to the far right lane.  The active cruise freaked out, slammed on the brakes (collision avoidance) and sounded the alarm and the flashing orange light on the dash.  It scared the $h_T out of me!!!  When I bought the car I asked if the radar could be turned off and the cruise control be regular cruise.  ""Yes"" they told me.  No you  actually can't.  I tried.  Today I was listening to a podcast on my i-phone (6) when I got a phone call.  I answered the call and I could her the caller, but she could not hear me.  This is the first time I have had a problem with an incoming call.  My wife has an i-phone (8 plus) and the contacts will not completely load.  Acura says it is and Apple software problem.  I can not comment on the cost of maintenance yet as I have not had anything done on it yet.  I have changed the oil because on a new engine I like to change the oil withing a few thousand miles to drain out the engine break-in byproducts.   Over all I am very happy with this car.  It is fun to drive and very comfortable.

acura,mdx,2018,Clare Conley, 04/16/2018,Nice Car-Could Be Better,pos,"We've had our 2018 MDX for about seven months, and have taken it on five road trips.  It replaced a 2010 RL, which in turn replaced a 2005 RL.  We like practically everything about the car except the adaptive cruise control (which picks up large trucks in the lane immediately to our right), the dimmed rear view mirror, and-significant blind spots only partly mitigated by the blind spot monitoring system. However, the big turn-off is the navigation system's traffic information.  Both the 2005 and 2010 RLs had the identical system, backed by XM radio based traffic info.  The MDX traffic is HD radio-based, and at least in Arizona, California, and Oregon, is spotty-some places it works some days.  Other days, it doesn't work in the same places.  Why, oh why, did they replace a functioning delivery system with a defective one?
"
acura,mdx,2018,James Peebles, 01/23/2019,Nine different electrical failures in twenty seven,neg,"I've been robbed. Nine different electrical failures in twenty seven weeks.  That's every three weeks there is a new problem. Most concerning is heated seat problem, possibly a fire hazard. Six failures have occurred one time, three problems are intermittent. Dealership can't emulate failures and will not change any components in an attempt to eliminate a possible cause. I am working with a regional case manager with Acura client relations now. Many other MDX models are having the same problems. If you are having a problem with your MDX, file a report with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . I think all of us should gather in some group and file a  class action lawsuit. Acura knows about these problems and continues to sell their defective product.

acura,mdx,2018,Chris Yoso, 06/05/2018,One Of The Best Midsize Luxury SUV’s,pos,"After owning an unreliable Gl550 resulting in over 5,000 dollars for repair, I decided our family should switch to something more reliable. While the Lexus RX was a solid choice it was slow and the lower trim levels was not really nice. I heard about Acura and thought I should check it out. Overall I am glad with my choice not only because of the lower price, but because of the reliability. This car feels upscale, not cheap. The only downside was the Acura dealers. The service is not very good.  "
acura,mdx,2018,Jennifer, 09/02/2018,Slow to leave 1st gear,neu,"Love the car but leaving from a stop its slow to go. Jerks coming out of first into second. Disappointing. Drove another mdx and it was ok so the problem is with mine. Dealership said it seemed fine but its not.
"
acura,mdx,2018,Shakor, 01/13/2019,Overpriced! Overrated!,neu,"Rear differential fluid must be changed every 7k miles! It used to be every 70k miles! This will run you about $300 at the dealer who is the only one recommended to do it. Premium gas is recommended. The car is sluggish with economy gas. I use plus gas. The car does jerk a little in the lower gears when pressing on the gas but could be due to gas quality. There tends to be some dust when I turn on the fan. Passengers will usually cough or sniffle when the air is on. The air quality and airflow is bad even with a new filter. The front seats are heated, the rear seats are not heated. It would be nice if all seats are heated. Headlights are nice and bright and have a cool design. The armrest on the door is a little hard. It should be made more comfortable. This SUV is overpriced in my opinion at 50K. Safety radar / collision detection feature to warn when approaching a vehicle too fast in front of me is very useful! Rear seats are not comfortable and padding is thin.

acura,mdx,2018,Brian, 08/10/2018,2018 MDX Advance is Awesome,pos,"Solid car! I don’t understand other reviews here. Great acceleration with smart instruments and powerful semi-autonomous driving! Lane Keeling assist kept me equidistant and worked like a charm. Let’s me know- as an older driver I am- if I happen to drift and corrects it for me. Many features and so fun to learn- my dealer has a class once a month so if you want to learn more about all the features you can without having to just poke around- and they feed you free with the great Acura Service bar- sandwiches and drinks served free! Try getting that from another Manufacturer- I can pre order my lunch by my phone and if I get my oil changed- just eat in their awesome lounge while the oil is changed Free! Yes- first 10 oil changes / tire rotations included! Best looking SUV ! Mine is black on black- our one kid loves the captain chair and she has her own console- No mini van needed! Can’t imagine anything better-

acura,mdx,2018,John C, 01/01/2019,Sluggish and Noisy,neg,"Car is slow and jerky in accelerating from 1st to 2nd gear. Is also extremely noisy at highway speed in above normal windy conditions. A clanking sound from underneath engine is quite common. Dealers reinforced sound deadening strips around doors and windows but noise can still be heard. Would not recommend this car.
"
acura,mdx,2018,Cal, 09/04/2018,Great value and style!,pos,"I compared the MDX with the Lexus R350L, Audi Q7 and Infinity QX60 and purchased this car because of the value, comfort and style.  I have been very pleased with the performance thus far."
acura,mdx,2018,Jim Smith, 05/05/2019,Great driving 4400lb Hybrid SUV,pos,"Ride and handling excellent.  Acceleration with assist of those 2 rear electric motors is awesome for this fuel efficient 4400lb SUV.  Average fuel economy is 25 to 30 MPG, but supreme gasoline is required.  Handling in hard driving rain is excellent.  Nighttime drive is excellent and on the winding 2 lane back roads exceptional with great stability and Auto dimming very bright headlights.  Yes, the transition from a stop while on battery to engine power takes bit to get use to, but is really not bad at all.  I find the controls are very easy to use and did not take much time to get use to using each.  I use Android Auto running Waze or Google Maps for navigation and could not ask for better performance.  Front climate controlled seating is awesome, 2nd row captain seats are great, while 3rd row seating is tight and be used for smaller kids or short trips for taller people.  Cargo capacity is good for me.  No towing with this Hybrid could be a problem for some.  I've driven this SUV for just about a year without issue and performance and ride for me has been exceptional both in city and on the highway.  Just about at the 2 year point and this SUV for me has been perfect.  No problems at all.  Ride and drive perfect.

acura,mdx,2018,MDX Owner 15 Years , 02/07/2020,Transmission Problems!!,neg,"I’ve had my 2018 MDX for two years.  At 17k miles I had to have my transmission replaced and serviced after at least 3 additional times to “reset” my transmission because of jerking and the influx from shifting from one gear while driving, mind you while during automatic mode.  My rear camera has been stuck on at least 6 times while driving, error messages but no light warning and getting stuck in Neutral while finishing my car wash.  In a panic about the person behind me about to smash into me because they are on the belt behind me.  Hitting the drive button, neutral button at least 16 times before having to placing my car in park while still on the belt.  Now I’m starting to hear the little humming noise again now at 25k miles, same sound I started to hear before my transmission went out the first time.  Love Acura but this might be my last rodeo depending on the out come with the dealer today.  Uhg!! 
"
acura,mdx,2018,Matt, 05/09/2018,Beware - Fragile electronics,neg,"The rear USB ports are perilously close to the rear drinks holders and unprotected from even the slightest spill.  My young boy spilt no more than a straw full of liquid but it was enough to completely short the electronics and completely incapacitate the car and render it undriveable.  After a four figure repair sum Acura client relations were rude and completely unsympathetic.  Will be the last Acura I ever buy - sticking with Lexus from now on.  Shame because the car actually drives great, but doesn't have the attention to detail of other luxury brands.

acura,mdx,2018,Charlotte, 04/28/2018,LOVE my 2018 Acura MDX with Technology,pos,"Having owned Buick, Honda, Toyota, and Opel, I absolutely love my new MDX.   The technology portions have been greatly improved and are easier to use.  And, I really love CarPlay.  In selecting my new vehicle, I test drove the Highlander, RDX and the MDX.  My requirements were ride comfort and low vehicle noise.  I would rank my choices as follows:  MDX, Highlander (a close second) and the RDX which made more sense economically.  However, the MDX met my primary needs better than the other two.  Knowing Acura's reliability made my decision, and I have been driving it now for a month and love it.  FYI, my friends have been very impressed with the ride and the ease of using the technology.  They drive 2018 Ford, Lexus, Toyota, and Honda SUV's.
"
acura,mdx,2018,WallyO, 07/25/2018,This car is a steal at full sticker,pos,"This SUV offers a combination of high technology in the very smooth, full-time torque-vectoring hybrid system, precise and entertaining dynamics and a comfortable and very quiet cabin that is unlike any other car I've driven; and I've owned dozens, including a few BMW's, several MB's, and four Mini Coopers. The Hybrid semi-autonomous systems work incredibly well (including the Lane Keep Assist, which makes the car nearly self-driving, with no ping-ponging from side to side), and the versatility of operational customization through the settings menu is stellar.  The four-drive-mode setup is also excellent, essentially allowing you to own three very different cars that you can instantly call up, depending on your mood and purpose in the moment. (The difference between Comfort and Normal is subtle, but Sport and Sport+ transform the car.) I know that some people feel the interior design and materials fall below that of other ""luxury"" cars, but I find the cabin very well made, very useful and very attractive. Like most BMW's, the interior is solid and understated, and avoids the ostentatious bling-bling look that some now equate with luxury and ""prestige."" This is a luxury car, but without pretension. The lack of glitzy features (like the completely unnecessary gimmick of Google Earth in the NAV system) is a relief, and makes the car functionally safer because of the lack of distractions. (If you want to play video games, I'd suggest you stay at home. If you want to know where you're going, simple map graphics are required.) Operationally, the Hybrid is complex enough in operation and functional options, that a new owner should take some time familiarizing himself or herself while still in the garage. After a week or two, you'll realize that you have a stellar vehicle on your hands.

acura,mdx,2018,Joe C, 04/17/2019,Ride the hybrid!! updated 4/18/2020,pos,"Overall we have been very happy with the MDX hybrid.  I must say I am at a loss with the Edmund's review which says the car feels lethargic around town.  The car was delivered with one of the folding mirrors not working properly but the dealer promptly fixed it but it should have been discovered pre-delivery.  The car has been recalled twice .  Overall the car is very complex and I have noticed some anomalies which quickly clear up.  Perhaps a dirty sensor or the extreme cold affects the systems for a few seconds.  We get over 26 mpg.  The car has the adaptive suspension which is fantastic.  Want the ride soft and cushy or firm and stable, just dial it up to your liking.  All in all we love the car and recommend it.

Update 4-18-2020
Over 15,000 trouble free miles  We continue to enjoy the MDX and all its features.  We have maintained a solid 26 mpg.  I have no complaints at this time.

acura,mdx,2018,T.J., 04/24/2019,Still some lingering issues not Acura Quality,neu,"Have had my 2018 MDX SH AWD with Technology  Package for over 2 1/2 years now. For the most  part it is a good vehicle, certainly not great. The Acura voice recognition system for virtually all applications is terrible. Pardon...Pardon...Pardon! It is past irritating. Acura has never found a fix.

Drivability is good but the transmission still surges at times when starting from a stop. Has be re-programed by the dealer with minimal changes. Vehicle developed a rattle in the rear interior area . Dealer took panels off and put  grease at every possible point that could rattle. Acura knew about the issue but has no permanent fix so the dealer did the best they could.
On a positive note the front seats are very comfortable.
In retrospect maybe I should have purchased the Honda Pilot. Believe it is a better value for the money.

It won't go when accelerating. It jerks from a stop all too often. Now I must take it into Acura because it isn't shifting into second gear going up our hill. Not a very big hill either. Too much transmission problems and this has been a problem with this car for years. I read since 2005. If it can't be fixed a redesign of the car is a necessity. TOO DANGEROUS.

Although a bit dated and light on luxurious interior the vehicle is packed with technology. The Acura MDX Sport Hybrid is agile and so fun to drive.

The acceration is poor at best. But that’s because you have to get use.  To using the hand throttle control in your fingers . Other then that the MDX technology package is a great value . Plus depending on how and what you did to accomplish buying your vehicle . My strategy was simple getting the most for the least possible cost . What other dealers in the market place were charging me plus tax . I ran a pretty hard bargain. In several dealerships . The comparison and competition was stiff . But you have to drive a hard barge all the way .

acura,mdx,2018,shortKarateGi, 04/20/2018,Must buy,pos,"If you’re in the market for an SUV, you have to consider the 2018 Acura MDX Sports Hybrid. This vehicle is not only fuel efficient, it is also a semi autonomous vehicle. With the combination of LKAS and Adoptive Cruise Control, it could almost drive itself. The infotainment is also good with Apple Carplay. The navigation is OK, I have yet to know how the traffic info can be accessed. For an average size and weight, this car is humongous, lots of space for the entire family. We were able to test the seating capacity, drove for about an hour and a half — no complaints; but I will not suggest it for a very long drive as the middle sit of the second row is quite uneasy to look at. Perhaps this can cary 6 adults and 2 kids? Acceleration is quite good for its size and the MPG was easily achieved, actually moe than the advertised combined MPG. We topped it with 28 and change — actual calculation at the fuel pump. Overall, it’s a verry good car to have. No complaints so far as the car is less than a month of ownership.

Fuel economy, handling , and acceleration is great. The sports+ mode gives you the sports car feel along with the paddle shifters.

Traded in my 2018 Acura RDX Advance because the ride was so non-luxury.  Drove a regular MDX and it rode much nicer, but the Hybrid with the Active Dampers is amazing!  (it is also now standard on the 2019 MDX advance non hybrid)  It rides so nice.  It is fast yet comfortable, and rides beautifully.  The switch from battery to gas is mostly seamless.  The 7 speed dual clutch is great, but at lower speeds tends to stumble like most dual clutch transmissions.  There could be less road noise (an Acura trait).  I love the infotainment system, and while it is dated, it has been in my last 3 cars and it works GREAT.  Of course that is if you take the time to learn it and speak to it correctly and clearly.  Love my MDX and may buy this one at the end of the lease!

acura,mdx,2019,Noelsup, 12/09/2018,Hybrid or Not,pos,When I saw the specs comparison of the Standard 2019 MDX w/ Tech and the Hybrid Tech model  my decision was clear . The hybrid adds up to 5 extra miles per gallon while providing 30 more horsepower. I said where do I sign . This is my first hybrid and I am still getting used to part of the engine turning off while in traffic or waiting for a signal light to change. It can become annoying but other than that the car rides great. One important point to note the Hybrid model you can not add a hitch or tow. also the  vehicle does not come with a spare or lug wrench or jack: instead comes with an inflator system . 
acura,mdx,2019,Terri T., 01/04/2019,Love it! Love it! Love it!,pos,"I have had just about every SUV on the market. I was going to get the Q7 this time but just cannot justify the price and my local dealers customer service is lacking. This time, we tested the RX350L,( we have loved our current RX350 but need something bigger for our 2nd vehicle) Infiniti QX60 and the MDX. Our sales person at Lexus told us to test drive the MDX (LOL!) we went across the street and it was love at first sight. We like all the features and tech, the sportiness of the exterior and the customer service was truly the best ever. For the first time, we actually enjoyed the process. Everyone was very professional, friendly and we didn't feel like we were being ""sold"". Shout out to Acura of Brookfield! I can't see us driving anything else.
"
acura,mdx,2019,Acura fan, 05/08/2019,A-Spec Spot On,pos,"This is my 5th Acura and second MDX.  For the money, I think Acura offers a better value in the luxury market, especially versus the German competition.  The latest A-Spec model features many sporty upgrades and looks hot to trot!  The lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control make this a driver-less car for all practical purposes.  The cruise is a bit slow to adapt especially when cars in front brake or speed up rapidly.  It’s hardly a significant concern, however.  The interior of the car is spacious and luxurious, the suede like leather is an eye catching upgrade.  The Krell sound system rocks on, especially with advanced engineered CD’s - remember them?  The Super Handling AWD is a must for every driving circumstance and performs especially well in higher speed cornering.  A dynamic control feature allows the drive to shift between 3 drive modes.  The Sport mode offers excellent acceleration, responsive steering and enhanced torque in the the S-AWD. The rear cargo space is spacious and fits all my baseball gear, lawn chairs, and coolers so my junk in the trunk has plenty of room to share the ride.  Getting into and out of the 3rd row seating was made easier but automatic seat control buttons accessible to both passengers in the rear 3rd row seats and from the second row.  The brake hold feature is a must have on every new car I’ll ever buy in the future.  It enables me to take my foot off the brake after a complete stop.  This saves the wear and tear on my leg.  Overall a 5 star car!"
acura,mdx,2019,David, 01/11/2019,Third MDX since 2014,pos,"Have now purchased our 3rd MDX since 2014.  Traded in our std 2014 MDX FWD Tech pkg on the new 2019. Had a 2016 SH-AWD Advance/Tech pkg and absolutely loved it but traded it for a Sierra Denali 4x4 truck only because I bought a big boat and needed something to tow it.  Looked at all comparable SUV’s in this class including Lexus, Benz, BMW and Audi.  We just keep coming back to the MDX.  Who cares about badging status on the hood?  Spending over $55K on a vehicle is a significant decision for anyone. The MDX is better at fuel economy, doesn’t break, handles great, has plenty of room, rich in features & feel with a great ride and handling.  We kept coming back to the 2019 MDX which we just bought after Christmas 2018.  Love the comfort and features of the second row buckets with very practical and usable center console.  We are  very pleased and experienced owners of Acura products.  My son also drives an Acura.  He has a TSX and it’s simply a lot of car for the money.  Again very low maintenance costs, no breakdowns, fantastic fuel economy with a pleasure to drive in town and highway feel.

acura,mdx,2019,Paul B., 12/21/2018,A+++ 2019 Acura MDX,pos,"I had an Acura MDX back in 2004 and never should have switched. After the Acura I went to a Mazda CX-9 which is a great vehicle in itself. So when I started to consider getting a new SUV I looked at a Mazda Signature, Lexus RX 350 L as well as Subura and Toyota Highlander. In the end once I drove the new MDX it was a no contest decision. From the safety features, the outstanding ride, quality and looks it was hands down MDX. I have had the vehicle for a month and like it more every time I drive it. I would recommend this vehicle to those who want safety, comfort and looks with extreme elegance as well. Acura has a hit and delivers on this one!

acura,mdx,2019,Allday, 06/20/2019,The best 3 Row SUV for someone looking for luxury,pos,"I’ve been looking at all the 3 Row SUVs and been a Lexus fan for years. But when the RXL didn’t have any room in the 3rd row, we looked elsewhere. I was glad to come across Acura MDX and was blown away by what you get with the price point. There lease programs can’t be beat so we pulled the trigger. The infotainment is dated but I use apple car play so it wasn’t a deal breaker. But everything else about the car and ride is better than the RX. I only wish they had a full glass roof.
"
acura,mdx,2019,Jim R, 06/20/2019,Pleased with the decision on MDX,pos,"Overall the SH-AWD MDX is an impressive 7 passenger SUV. The engine is the long tried and trusted SOHC V6 that’s been around for a long time and proven itself. It’s poweband is well-mated to the ZF 9-speed’s ratios. The engine is smooth through the rev range but really comes on at and above 4000. It also emits a pretty refined but aggressive snarl, backing up the performance image Acura is hoping to convey. The ride is composed yet slanted towards comfort and not so much hard core performance. The ride is unquestionably supple and very little road noise enters the cabin. By far the most impressive attribute of the MDX is its fit and finish. Equal to any European luxury SUV we’ve owned or test driven. My one wish would be to somehow better the real, day-to-day fuel efficiency. This MDX replaced an Audi Q5 TDI, which returned an average of 30+ mpg, combined (along with jet-like acceleration) and it cannot come close to the Audi’s MPG (yes not fair to compare a gasoline and diesel vehicle, I know). All told, my wife and I are very fond of our MDX.

acura,mdx,2019,ACURA FAN, 02/21/2019,ACURA FAN,pos,"Very nice suv reliable and very good mpg for a big car. the technology on the car is outdated for example, the navi, and the dash board. There is no wireless charger even know i have a 2019 advance. Also the entertainment is not blue ray like the one on the pilot or the Honda van.  but overall is a very good suv, i like how it drives and also how it looks. The most important thing is that you don't spend to much money on services or repairs like on the mercedes benz or bmw.

acura,mdx,2019,Ralph, 05/14/2019,"Transmission struggles , navigation graphics poor",pos,"The navigation is poor.  specially the graphics which are useless in a city with  detail.  Also verbal commands are slow and often non responsive.                        The automatic transmission struggles at speeds between 20-45 mph,  It cannot decide which gear it wants to be in......disappointing since this was supposed to be greatly improved.

acura,mdx,2019,David Hall, 02/11/2019,Second MDX is better than the first,pos,"This car is great value for $50,000. My only possible concern is that there are no warning sensors for getting too close while parking. And, that’s why I spent $500 to replace the rear tail light the truck hit"
acura,mdx,2019,Malia B, 02/15/2019,Very disappointed,neg,"My husband and I recently bought this car because we have a little one on the way and we’ve been frustrated and disappointed ever since. The car drives fine- very smooth and nice acceleration- but the rest of it is just NOT user friendly at all. I don’t know how the entertainment system was even allowed to be designed the way it is. The buttons on the screen are tiny. It’s so challenging to navigate when it should be straightforward. It’s even hard to change things like volume and air conditioner speed- things you don’t want to be worrying about while driving. My phone will connect to Bluetooth but not import my phone book for voice activation, which is the main point. Apparently this has been an ongoing issue for others as well, so be aware if you’re thinking about buying this car. I’ve tried contacting Acura support for help multiple times and each time I have to hang up after being on hold for thirty minutes. So, service is apparently terrible as well. For as much money as we spent on this “luxury” brand, I would expect so much more!!!

acura,mdx,2019,jeff Spencer, 09/05/2019,Acura Convert,pos,"I have been a Lexus owner for many years and recently traded a Honda Pilot in on a 2019 ES 350.  Big mistake, don’t get me wrong the car is awesome but I immediately realized that I made a mistake.  The car is almost impossible to get out of and after 3 weeks of ownership I couldn’t take the pain from the seats(very hard) so I parked it while deciding what to do.  MDX to the rescue.  From the moment I stepped into the SUV for a test drive it took about 10 minutes and I knew that it was the right fit.  We worked out a generous trade and an hour later I was on my way.  Everything about this vehicle is first class. I can’t believe how happy I am with the vehicle.  Try it you’ll love it. 
"
acura,mdx,2019,Acura fan, 05/08/2019,A-Spec Spot On,pos,"This is my 5th Acura and second MDX.  For the money, I think Acura offers a better value in the luxury market, especially versus the German competition.  The latest A-Spec model features many sporty upgrades and looks hot to trot!  The lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control make this a driver-less car for all practical purposes.  The cruise is a bit slow to adapt especially when cars in front brake or speed up rapidly.  It’s hardly a significant concern, however.  The interior of the car is spacious and luxurious, the suede like leather is an eye catching upgrade.  The Krell sound system rocks on, especially with advanced engineered CD’s - remember them?  The Super Handling AWD is a must for every driving circumstance and performs especially well in higher speed cornering.  A dynamic control feature allows the drive to shift between 3 drive modes.  The Sport mode offers excellent acceleration, responsive steering and enhanced torque in the the S-AWD. The rear cargo space is spacious and fits all my baseball gear, lawn chairs, and coolers so my junk in the trunk has plenty of room to share the ride.  Getting into and out of the 3rd row seating was made easier but automatic seat control buttons accessible to both passengers in the rear 3rd row seats and from the second row.  The brake hold feature is a must have on every new car I’ll ever buy in the future.  It enables me to take my foot off the brake after a complete stop.  This saves the wear and tear on my leg.  Overall a 5 star car!
"
acura,mdx,2019,S. Smith, 03/29/2019,Very disappointed,neu,"I traded the 2018 RDX for the 2019 MDX. WTH is wrong with Acura putting the temperature control on the awful screen?? Changing/adjusting the temperature is enough to cause an aneurism. Are you supposed to pull over everytime you need to adjust it?? This is a huge safety issue and utterly stupid. The 9 speed transmission is not great, and while it's not as loud as the RDX, it's still very loud on the interior.  The GPS is still garbage,  please see Verizon's navigation app for some 21st century ideas, your GPS is still trash. Last Acura for me.

acura,mdx,2019,MamaKath, 10/29/2019,Exactly what I wanted!,pos,"I was looking for a vehicle that could seat 5 comfortably, but with optional seating for more. I also wanted a 6 cylinder engine. The turbo charged 4 cylinder engines seem great, but I don't think there is enough data to prove their long term benefits. I drive my cars into the ground, so I want a car that will last for at least 10 years. The MDX has everything I want. The 50/50 split 3rd row seat allows for a comfortable seat while also providing ample cargo space. I have owned my MDX for about 6 weeks and couldn't be happier.

acura,mdx,2019,Ann Gantt, 09/28/2019,MDX is the best,pos,"This car has all the bells and whistles, even on the base model. It is fun to drive.

I love it."

acura,mdx,2019,Steve, 11/17/2019,First time MDX owner,pos,"Very happy with our purchase. We purchased a 2019 MDX SH-AWD Standard package. We did not need the upgraded Tech package since 2019 MDX has apple car play. We really like all the safety features in AcuraWatch, was a major factor for us. 

Just finished an 800 mile road trip and at the end of the drive, we didn’t feel like we have been on a long trip. The ride was so nice, comfortable and quiet...it’s like the car drives you. 

We looked at all the major players, and for the price we were able to get it for, it was an easy decision. Our first Acura and our first “luxury” car and couldn’t be happier. Buy an MDX for less than a highlander, um yes please. 

The MDX handles like a car, fun to drive if you want it to be, but plush and comfy as well. All this with a 3rd row for our 2 kiddos and stuff. 

Highly recommended the MDX.

acura,mdx,2019,Bama Belle, 03/04/2020,No Regrets,pos,"I leased this SUV in July 2019 and have put 4,600 miles on it so far. I  can honestly say I absolutely love the vehicle! Plenty of room, all the bells and whistles I need (Apple Car Play, Power folding mirrors, remote start, SH-AWD, ELS Stereo, heated seats, Siri Eyes Free, AcuraLink, Nav, etc.). The transmission is butter  smooth. My MDX has been on 3 road trips so far and it is super comfortable to drive long distances. I feel very safe especially knowing I have the SH-AWD system. The ride quality is very smooth. Plenty of cargo room (I keep the 3rd row down). I do not regret for one second leasing this vehicle even though a redesign is right around the corner. I got a great deal and know the vehicle has had several improvements to keep it amazing. Well done Acura! 
"
acura,mdx,2019,Andy, 07/15/2020,"Great value, love almost everything",pos,"For the money, this can’t be beat. Got a FWD Tech for nearly $10k off sticker. That’s Honda Toyota Hyundai Kia money for a luxury brand. Inner snob is satisfied. 

The only bad is the transmission. It’s not awful, but sometimes in the 40-50 range it just can’t decide what gear to take and it’s sometimes awkward and jerky. Solution - cruise control only at higher speeds. 
Also wish I’d sprung for the advance pkg in order to Get cooled seats and heated steering wheel. Features our old Kia minivan had. But power memory steering wheel is a real plus. 

More good:
Infotainment. It gets a bad rap, but with Apple CarPlay on top, you’ll never need the janky outdated factory Navi (except as a backup when there’s no cell signal), and the bottom screen shows the audio. Easy peasy. It’s auto climate control and the temp +\- toggle switches are great. 
Sound system is pretty good too. 

The transmission- in the mountains in sport mode, it was telepathic. Held lower gears both up and downhill, I didn’t have to ride the brakes. Played with the paddles some but it wasn’t even necessary. Was SO FUN in the twisties, felt like my good old Accord but bigger and more powerful. Such a blast on our summer vacation in Colorado. 

Fuel economy - not bad, 19ish avg mixed, 25 over a long hot fast 2100 mile road trip. Had I stayed in the 70s mph, would have been high 20s mpg, but I was making good time with cruise at 88 (in a 75 zone). 

Great cruiser, could be a bit quieter but the comfort and handling are very good.

acura,mdx,2020,Steve C., 09/15/2019,Previous European car owner,pos,"I've been doing a lot of research in the last few weeks on which SUV would be right for me.  My past vehicles have been Saab, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo and Porsche. I've only owned 2 Japanese cars Honda & Subaru. I have to say all the European models were spot on as far as appearance and performance but one thing for sure expensive to own if your warranty runs out. Any repairs or service for these cars can be a huge expense (Porsche oil change $275). I normally buy my cars outright and keep them for at least 8 yrs so I asked my mechanic what he thought.  He told me he's been in the auto repair business for 28 yrs and while some  Euro cars are beautiful looking  as far as reliability, dependability and cost efficient you cannot beat Japanese cars.  After checking out Lexus, Infinity and Volvo I decided to give the MDX a test drive and was very much impressed for how much value you receive at around $10,000-$15,000 less than most European models. I've only had this car for a few weeks and I can say so far I love this car.  It's spacious, looks great, handles excellently for an SUV, has many standard safety features, and has a very smooth ride. After reading some reviews on this car I was a bit hesitant about remarks on the info system being non intuitive but it really wasn't that bad at all it's amazing all the features this car has. I drive to Florida once a year and like to take a lot of road trips and now I feel confident that I can do so with worrying about high maintenance cost or finding the right facility that can service my vehicles. All in all I am very please with my purchase.  I will give another update in a few months..
"
acura,mdx,2020,Mike in Katy. Texas , 09/30/2019,The MDX offers the most bang for your $,pos,"Update to the review. I’ve now had the MDX for a year and it continues to exceed my expectations. Due to Covid, I haven’t put as many miles on it as would have been, but it was still over 10,000 miles. It drives great and came in handy when taking hurricane relief supplies to my family 500 miles away in Alabama. With all seats folded, I was able to take a generator and a week’s worth of supplies, so it’s size really came in handy. 

Overall I continue to be extremely pleased with the MDX. 

I’ve owned a 2002 MDX, three Honda Pilots (2006, 2013, 2017) and they’re great SUVs. I traded my 2017 Pilot for a 2020 MDX, FWD w Technology package. The MDX is amazing. It looks fantastic and drives even better. It’s a great mix of sporty, with excellent comfort. The two screen infotainment system gets a lot of bad press, but I like it a lot. It allows me to have Apple Car Play with maps on the top screen, while showing which song I have playing on the lower screen. The single touch screen in the Pilot was excellent, but often switched to the next song, requiring me to move it back to maps on a longer trip. The dual screen MDX doesn’t require that. 

The MDX drives like a dream. It’s powerful and smooth. The nine speed ZF transmission has been hammered, but it seems quite smooth to me. The sport mode is especially fun, as it tightens down the steering and makes me forget I’m driving an SUV. 

The ELS stereo is outstanding, and as quiet as the MDX is, it allows the ELS to really shine. While I had to upgrade my Pilot with aftermarket speakers, the MDX Tech package removes  the need for that. 

The seats are amazingly comfortable and the 14 way adjustable seats makes it feel like you’re sitting in a lounge chair. 

Overall, the MDX offers the most bang for the buck in the crowded luxury SUV space.  
"
acura,mdx,2020,SL2C, 12/14/2019,Sensible Review and Impressions MDX 2020,pos,"I decided to write a review to help those who are on lookout for their luxury SUV buying adventure.

There are a tons of choices and all are good and since no size fits all, MDX may not be a right choice for you. I will give you my experience of buying and features that we use all the time.

First of all this is a solid car which we hope to own for a long time. Everything in car is high end and not overly show off. I read a lot about two screens and I actually love it. It is a brilliant implementation. It takes some time to learn but if you are middle of the road tech person you will learn it fast.

First screen on the top and deep  inside the dashboard is for inbuilt navigation and apple play and Android auto. It is non touch screen for a reason because you can't touch it. But since it is dedicated to a particular function it remains that way all through the trip. Other screen is dedicated to normal functioning of controls and buttons below that screen control Navigation and Apple Play screen. Don't fret too much about it you will learn fast and will realize how splendid two screen idea is.

Now, lane assist and adaptive cruise are the two most used functions and they work perfectly on high way but sporadically on inner roads. Which is not a big deal as you should be in charge of driving while in your neighborhood.

The biggest upside of having advance model is 360 view camera. It is brilliant if you want to know how far are you from car parked next to you or how far the right side curb is while parallel parking. Having back seats heated are important if you will be driving kids around. And heated steering wheel is great during cold weather.

Pricing wise we found out the best discount you can get is in $7000 to $7500 range off of msrp. So let your dealer price it up. Go back home and counter with $7500 below. Most likely dealer will accept. You can go on TrueCar and randomly select dealers nearby and request pricing pick the best price and ask your dealer to match. From our experience best price was $7,500 below MSRP.

Before you decide to buy sit down with finance person and ask what additional warranties or treatments are available. There are a lot and for us making decision on the same day while picking up the car was hard. We suggested our dealer to improve on that. But there are some good ones and it makes sense to get those.

Extended warranty is expensive at $4000+ but it virtually covers everything non wear tear up to 125,000 miles. If you are going to keep car for that long and afraid if technology inside the car will fail then it buys you a piece of mind. Having window treatment and outer body treatment is another great option that covers from spills inside and dents outside. And it is lifelong.

Accessories are another area where there are some great choices. Having a tow hitch and splash guards with all weather mats in my opinion is a must for this car. In a high traffic area use tow hitch to install rear collision protection guard and you don't have to worry about someone rear ending your car. Splash guard protects sides of your car from mud splashing.

Whether you buy tech package or advance both are great and not having overly jazzy but a solid family luxury car is what you need and you are a buy and hold kind of family then this is a car for you.

Happy hunting."
acura,mdx,2020,Deb , 01/09/2020,Super Impressed!,pos,"It took me a year to finally buy an Acura MDX- wanted one for a long time, but I am one that probably researches way too much and I kept seeing 2 main complaints... the 9 speed transmission and the infotainment!

So far I am loving the MDX it’s super smooth! Whatever refinements have been made have seemed to work so far and I really like the 2 screen infotainment! I bought the advance AWD with Entertainment and I’m super happy- at this point... I’m still holding my breath a little hoping that I don’t have trouble with shifting, but so far it’s so smooth.

The last 3 cars I’ve bought have been the last year right before a new model change and it’s worked for me... all the kinks seem to have been ironed out.

I have no trouble with the touch screen AC controls ect and I pretty much do everything other than AC from the steering wheel... the main reason I went with Advance was the leather seats they are so soft and worth it to me to pay the extra for comfort! 

I’ve had a Lexus RX 350 and it was not near as comfortable and roomy as the MDX... buying car is such a personal decision I just hope this helps someone who may be struggling as well...

acura,mdx,2020,Hoyden, 01/12/2020,Worthwhile upgrade from Pilot.,pos,"Quiet, competent, quality.  All of the Honda build quality and engine excellence with more sound dampening insulation and better ride than the excellent Pilot.  I like the two level screens, keeps your radio info showing on the lower screen while your phone call goes onto the upper screen. Plenty of power, never gets loud, even under full throttle acceleration.  2nd gear off the line system is smooth and quiet. I waxed the car, the paint is flawless across the body, no divots, no rough spots. Quiet sunroof at speed with the optional air deflector. I would like a roll shade over the back deck as I never use the 3rd row seats. I liked it better than the Volvo XC-90 for much less $$.

I can’t understand what’s so difficult about having two screens one upper screen for apple car play and driving info And bottom screen for radio cd etc its very well planned and nothing confusing about it .
I am driving MDX since 2010 now I upgraded to 2020 MDX
I got excellent deal and a decent trade in price for my old MDX .
Plus no extra charge for awesome HONDA SENSING features a must have which other charge thousands of dollars for these features
Will recommend AWD, drive and handling is cool AND less drag on your body when you drive long distance in AWD

acura,mdx,2020,John, 03/21/2020,MDX Sport Hybrid Advanced,pos,"Spent months looking around at different cars (Mercedes, Audi, Subaru, Toyota) and ultimately decided I wanted the Sport Hybrid with Advance package.  I found a new 2019 with the Canyon Bronze that I wanted about 100 miles from my house so got a great deal on a new car.  With Acura's incredible warranty on certified I would have been just as happy with a certified used with low miles..  I had some reticence based on what I had read about the infotainment and the quality of the materials on the interior.  My wife has a 2017 Honda Pilot Elite with the 9 speed transmission and will admit that I don't love it.  But the Sport Hybrid doesn't share the same transmission.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase.  The car has great acceleration, very smooth, the infotainment system is perfectly fine and it is nice to have Apple Car Play/Nav/Camera in one screen and the Stereo on another.  The safety features (lane keep, brake hold, adaptive cruise, etc.) are a great feature and are standard on all MDXs.  You pay a lot extra on other vehicles for those features and once you have them you realize how great they are.  Very pleased with the quality of the interior, too.

Things I don't love are that that the controls for the seat heater/cooler aren't terribly easy to use, but if you put it on auto I have found it is not an issue and I don't have to use the controls very often.  I wish it had a digital speedometer like our Pilot and our Mercedes.  You get used to having one so it is a bit of an adjustment when you switch to pure analog.  I don't love the push button gear shifter.  I think with time I will get used to it and it will not be an issue at all.  The Pilot has it and my wife said she got used to it.  

Overall, exceptionally happy with the vehicle and highly recommend.  I have only had it for a few weeks so if my feelings change I will repost.

Only negative I've seen is the well reported delay in cruise control response, reference the time it takes the vehicle to move into a new speed when the cruise control is already engaged.

"
acura,mdx,2020,VINNYNY, 09/26/2020,Best Value & Performance with a Side of Utility!,pos,"My last three SUVs were a Mercedes Benz, a BMW, and a Honda Pilot EX-L. I bought the Pilot because I wanted a vehicle that could haul my family of four, a couple of my kids' friends and all of our gear to the beach, amusement park, or on weekend getaways. The Pilot had the ""Utility"" part of SUV wired, but it totally lacked in the ""Sport"" department. My MB and BMW had the opposite problem.  The MDX SH-AWD delivers on both counts. Although it handles much better than the Pilot, it hauls almost as much. Acura should call it an ""FUV"" for Fun Utility Vehicle.

The reviews here bash the dual screens as archaic, but I love them. I can see my navigation and entertainment on separate screens without scrolling through the pages of a single large display. I never have to switch away from the nav screen to find a new radio station, change the source, or dial a call. Speaking of navigation, I purposely bought a base model because I'm not a fan of Honda/Acura's navigation systems. We have owned eight Honda/Acuras with navigation systems in the last 20 years and the nav system has always been the worst part of the car. With the MDX, I use Android Auto running Google Maps or Waze--much better than the OEM Garmin units!

Maybe the ""V"" should stand for value. I paid less than $35K for my MDX (plus TTL)--that's $20K less than I paid for my MB, $10K less than my BMW, and $5K less than the Pilot! The MDX is so inexpensive right now, that I'm thinking about buying a second one for my wife. Love it!

acura,mdx,2020,Molly Spence, 12/12/2020,I went back.,pos,"I had a 2008 MDX for many years and loved it. In 2018 I decided to shop around and chose, just for fun, the Volvo XC60 - I liked the sporty look and the wood-trimmed interior. But in driving it the first week, my whole family was annoyed by the engine noise level on the highway, the rigid back seats, the handling in snow, cumbersome tech and more. So about a year later, I decided on a lark to test drive an MDX again. It felt like returning to an old boyfriend who was so warm and strong, so good at hugs, tough and adventurous and capable to make me feel taken care of, but also, you know, a man who likes luxury and cleans up nice. He’s not the first one you notice — but why had I left this man?
 That day I ended my Volvo fling and brought home MDX. The whole family was so relieved and happy.

acura,mdx,2020,Rachael Hughes, 09/25/2019,Absolutely awful,neg,"This car is so so so outdated and terrible. The two screen system is so incredibly confusing. It has apple CarPlay, but why even try to use it when you can’t toucj the screen and have to use a nonsensical dial that doesn’t give you the full features and accessibility! The cabin could be likened to a recycling plant. Do not believe what the dealers say! This is a car stuck in the 20th century. Buyers beware.  
"
acura,mdx,2020,Informed consumer, 06/06/2020,Nice but not overly luxurious. Decent gas mileage.,pos,"The MDX will be upgraded in 2021. Styling is dated but still appealing. Navigation screen is much smaller than other cars in the class but I’m sure that will change in 2021. Power, performance and handling are good. Comfort is also      Very good. The start stop feature on this and all other makes of vehicles needs to go away! It interferes with climate control comfort and will be a maintenance issue down the road. The gas savings is minimal and doesn’t justify the inconvenience. There must be a better way! Overall the Acura MDX is a quality vehicle.

Acura has no fix.  The ac is not near as cold as my old Murano or Toyota’s and just adjusting the heat and ac on the screen is bizarre  reds normal heat and ac buttons/controls. Other than that car rides nice but will not be keeping after lease is up. I’m just crap out of luck w this one.

I was initially going to get the Lincoln Aviator but the price was $500/mo more.  The best part of the deal was they gave me $27500 for my 2015 Mercedes GL450.  The Acura is a nice car with a lot of amenities for a base model.  The only thing the base model was lacking was the navigation, but I use my navigation through my smart phone, and I think I like it better that way.  Other than that I am happy with my choice.

acura,mdx,2020,Duke, 11/17/2020,Love it!,pos,"We shopped a long time and compared all the models.  The price point and features of the MDX drew us in and did not let go.  Then we saw and fell in love with the PMC Edition.  I know it's really only 9 layers of paint, blacked out trim and a badge, but it's freaking awesome to be 1 of 330 in North America!
It's powerful, smooth to drive, handles really well, and has really great cargo storage.  Our third row is always down.
Definitely recommend the MDX.

acura,mdx,2020,G. Colton , Atlanta,Too Much Tech,pos,"This past May we purchased a brand new 2020 Acura MDX complete with the technology package. I had been driving an MDX for the previous nine years and was extremely fond of that car. The new model has, in my opinion, too much tech. For example, there is no stick shift anywhere in the vehicle. The transmission is all electric push button. It takes a while just to get the hang of it.  The car has an assortment of safety beeps and dings and flashing lights that alert you to potential roadside hazards. The problem with these is, they trigger frequently during what I shall call normal driving.
The owners instruction manual, while the thickness of a small library book, has so much information about so many things, and you have to read the fine print just to figure out how to work the radio. I guess you could say I have become used to the old way and now find myself slightly lost. Thank you"

break the bank. This is my 2nd. NSX. 
My previous one was a green 1996. I 
sold it with 62,000 miles and the car 
was tight with no problems. I bought 
my 2002 with 11,000 miles. I wanted a 
red one and wanted the 3.2 and 6 
speed. My buddy has a Porsche and he 
said it costs him more than his ex-
wife. I drove Vipers, Corvettes and 
Porsches. I feel the NSX out did them 
all. In overall driveability, quality 
and fun factor. My wife loves to drive 
it. And you don't see one on every 
corner. IT'S A TRUE EXOTIC. "

much I'd have liked it. Driving this 
car is as fun as driving it for the

Truly spectacular. Worth the extra 30 
thousand dollars over the Corvette -- 
this thing has *soul*."
acura,nsx,2002,Kiwi, 05/08/2002,A fine instrument,pos,"I'll take hand-crafted aluminum over

yourself a Caddy with an 8-liter V8.

is an axe. To join the legions of macho 
men that have the world looking at your

I have not spent a cent on the car except for normal maintenance and an upgrade to a Comptec exhaust system. I didn't notice a change in performance, just a better exhaust sound. I just had an oil change and the tech said I still had 60% left on the brakes. There are no squeaks or rattles and everything works perfectly. I will need to replace the tires soon. The short throw shifter and 6 speed are a pleasure to drive. A tip of the hat to Acura and this car. It's no wonder that used NSXes hold their value.  "
acura,nsx,2002,RPM217, 06/18/2003,Excellence at a price,pos,"I came out of a 2000 C5 convertible, it 
was a great car, I wanted something 
different, this is clearly different.  
People ask me to compare the two, I 
tell them that the Vette was brute 
force, and the NSX is pure finesse.  
The torque advantage of the Vette is 
obvious, but the 0-60 times are not 
that different between the two.  The 
NSX is so much more ""tossable"" and you 
don't feel close to the ""limit"" on the 
street. It's a blast, and people don't 
know what it is, even after 12+ years"

hp. Yes, I like the way it looks and 
handles and all the exotic materials 
like the all aluminum body and titanium 
connecting rods. The interior leaves 
little to be desired. I mean even the 
Acura RSX has a more modern looking 
interior then the NSX. I especially 
like the white gauges in the RSX. Come 
on Acura, or actually the Honda Motor 
Company, if you want to sell more NSX's 
you have got to get with the program.

Raw Horsepower), then you'll be 
surprised that this ""merely 290HP"" NSX 
can outrun most stock sports cars that 
has more much more HP on the drag strip 
as well as on the track. The engine has 
the 2nd best soundtrack of any sports 
car (I rank Ferraris on the top of my 
list). Words aren't enough to describe

$30,000. lower then where the present 
model is priced. ACURA has always been 
know for it's great cars at reasonable

advantage over the NSX. Or if you are 
Corvette alergic, get a Dodge Viper. 
Way better and still saves you 20K."
acura,nsx,2002,laseca, 05/18/2002,This NSX is awesome compared to Z06,pos,"I've driven a ZO6 for a few days before 
buying the NSX.  Here's a comparison:

The Z06's steering is too light No feel. 
Shifting is truck-like. Body rigidity is worse 
than my 11 year old Honda. Ergonomics are 
pathetic. Controls vintage 1970. Build quality 
poor. Wavy panels, uneven gaps. 
Acceleration and braking are much better 
than the NSX.  Handling is about equal.

The Z06 feels half sports car and half truck. 
The shift feel is horribly coarse. This car feels 
like an old rattly crapbox with a big engine 
stuffed into it. There is none of the hi-tech 
feel one gets from most modern cars. Sure it 
costs less than a new NSX but I don't see 
the attraction at all.  You get what you pay 
for."

ferrari or lambro, and a similar 
price,however it doesnt have the 
performance of them. Its close though. 
This car isnt one you should get if 
your looking for pure performance. You

It is definitely faster than when I first received 
it.  It is the easiest manual transmission I've 
ever driven--ratios are perfect, gates easy to

wife loves it.  The brakes are strong.  The 
acceleration is very good, but my son says 
the Z-06 he has driven is much faster.  The

acura,nsx,2004,Peter Pantazopoulos, 07/24/2004,Horsepower is Lagging.,pos,"In all it is a fun car and it turns 
heads. I don't like the fact I need to 
but a new set of tires every 7000 miles 
and also that the horsepower is not up 
to speed with the rest of the exotics 
in the class.  Maintenance wise it is 
an incredible purchase and a very 
rugged vehicle."
acura,nsx,2004,matthew, 03/08/2007,WOW,pos,"What can I say? This is the exotic all cars that have come after it have had to set as a benchmark in terms of reliability and performance, and many cars costing twice as much still fail to meet the goal 15 years after the car was introduced."
acura,nsx,2005,Shawn So. Cal, 11/04/2008,Absolute Dream,pos,"I've had this car for almost 1 year.  The drive is superb, tight, quick, and responsive.  The style and attention to detail of the body hasn't been matched. Everywhere you go, people comment.  One catch, it is mainly guys that comment, women have no clue what they are seeing, so if your goal is to attract women, buy a Ferrari or a Porsche. The women that do notice tend to know a lot about the history of the car and what it is.  The look and feel of the drive is awesome.  Recently drove an M6 with over 500hp and love the NSX even more. You feel like you are one with the road.  The NSX is an extension of you and your skills.  Anyone considering this car drive the others first, and you will see"
acura,nsx,2005,goodbuy, 11/11/2004,i love this car,pos,"this car is a trip what a head 
turner    gets almost 30mpg on the hwy
and out performs most anything on the   
road"
acura,nsx,2005,High Desert NM, 11/05/2005,My second NSX,pos,"This is my second NSX. I owned a '91 automatic and now own a Spa Yellow '98 6spd targa. I love this car for its beautiful, timeless style, reliablity, and of course it's exclusivity. I lived in NM 2+ years and have only seen 2 other NSXs. The view out the front window is the best in the business--- GT Prototype-like. The car is subtly fast-- 0-60 in 5.0 and 30-80 in a snap. The NSX has remarkable handling without too much drama. The car thinks along with you-- I guess that's what they mean when they say you become one with the car. This car looks as good standing still as it does flying by. The six speed transmission is Mazda Miata-like is quickness and short shifting distance."
acura,nsx,2005,Brad Tuski, 02/02/2006,A smart mans exotic car,pos,The car is unbelievable it handles like a gem and is a constant head turner.
acura,nsx,2005,eyez2glow, 10/02/2004,I love this car!,pos,"There are some things worth sacrificing 
for.  At a larger payment than my home, 
its worth it, and I feel great in it. 
ITs safe, handles excellllllllently, 
even with my speed heavy foot!"
acura,nsx,2005,stephanie s, 09/30/2004,THis car is awesome,pos,"I wish i could keep this car forever. 
Or on the other hand that it would last 
for ever. It's the best car i have ever 
had and could ever ask for"
acura,nsx,2005,RIDDA, 10/23/2004,Like no other,pos,"This car is really like no other. Sure 
other cars can boast higher horsepower 
and probably have a longer history or 
lineage, but in terms of something very 
unique which not many people know 
about, it has a character all in its 
own. There are no real words to 
describe it. It does no justice, but 
for the select few who get a chance to 
step in and drive one of these hand 
built exotics, it trully is an 
experience one should partake in."
acura,nsx,2005,Morrow, 10/23/2004,Four months experience!,pos,"Most responsive car I have ever 
driven.  Mine is a silver 2004.  I also 
have a 1978 Corvette.  No contest.

I often find someone standing around it 
when I park in a lot.  Mostly, they 
want to know what it is.  There are no 
identifying marks on the outside except 
the Acura ""A"" on the trunk."
acura,nsx,2005,Matt, 02/24/2005,Still A Great Drive,pos,"Unless you are going to go to a racetrack and take on the new vette or vipers, you will not be disappointed by the horsepower.  The car is still 5.0 sec to 60 and handles incredibly well.  The NSX is very much improved from the 2002 model year forward.  There are very few automotive reviews on the post-2002 NSX which is a shame because the driving experience is much imporved over the older car."
acura,nsx,2005,Too Exotic, 02/25/2005,The real exotic car.,pos,"Big time head turner & get many thumbs up, Great PERFORMANCE, oustanding stylish look to it. Does not get blown away from any cars, as a matter of fact, it steals & attention from any car out there. Just way too hot.  When I pull up anywere, people have their jaws dropped onto the ground while staring at it. This car steals the show from M3 & any Porshce out there. You need a $250K Ferrari or $450k Carrera GT to compete with the NSX, not any upgraded volkswagen on steriods like the M3 & Porshce.  Can a Vette beat the NSX? OF course, but keep in mind, vette is only 1/2 the price of NSX. It really isn't a matter of affording any of the car, it is truely a matter of choice & taste!"
acura,nsx,2005,O.C. Dave, 09/17/2005,Great Car,pos,"The trill & performance of a Ferrari, with the reliability and low cost maintenance of an Acura. This is my 2nd. NSX and this has the best bang for the buck in the sports car market. I met a 1994 NSX owner whose car had over 200,000 miles on it. His only costs were for normal maintenance. I drove his 1994 and it was still tight and rattle free. People are always stopping me to ask questions or compliment on the car. "
acura,nsx,2005,kushbudz, 09/17/2005,An exotic without the price tag.,pos,No other car I have owned has attracted so much attention (it's almost a problem actually). The ride is exceptional and it corners like a bat outta hell. The interior is simple and free of the usual slew of buttons and oversized LCD screens. I much prefer this to the modern trend of bloating the car out with useless features  (it's a sports car not a cadillac). Add a supercharger and you will toast Ferrari's and Porsches that cost twice as much.
acura,nsx,2005,King Dudley, 11/16/2005,King Dudley's WHITE NSX,pos,"The automobile is SUPERB.  It is STILL what others are trying to evolve to.  The handling and performance is incredible for Acura.  Fun to drive and looks great, backed by Honda's reliability.  An everyday exotic,  which is still an ""exclusive"" exotic as well.   KD 1"
acura,nsx,2005,Harry Leff, 01/31/2006,2005 Acura NSX,pos,"This my second NSX.  I had purchased the first one in 1991 and and in 2003 purchased the anniversary corvette.  After a year of the corvette, had to sell it and purchase another NSX. The NSX is agile, quick, responsive and beautiful.  The car is pure, not fancy regarding features ...lacks navigation, heated seats, bluetooth, etc.  But if you are looking for a great sportscar that virtually has not changed for 15 years, its because Honda created perfection from day one."
acura,nsx,2005,T Str, 07/15/2016,Great older generation auto,pos,"Edmunds has no idea based on its appraisal feedback of the true market value of this car.
"
acura,nsx,2017,T. F Malik, 04/30/2017,90% of Porsche 918 at 80% discount,pos,"Super handling super car that blends the qualities of Ferrari and Porsche nicely in a relatively affordable package if ordered with the only essential option of Carbon Ceramic disk brakes. Can be a daily use car except in snow and ice unless equipped with proper tires and clearance issues with snow as it has pretty low clearance and no option to raise the car to clear the snow. Acceleration is instant, thanks to electric assist that takes away the turbo lag, torque vectoring with the front electric motors works transparently to assist in carving turns at any speed.
"
acura,nsx,2017,Eric, 01/06/2018,this is the best car that i have ever owned,pos,"Ive owned a Ferrari, Audi R8, Porsche, Jaguar, Lexus and others. i had the old Acura NSX and this blows away all of the cars that I've owned.
"
acura,nsx,2017,Jaws, 03/09/2018,New Sports Experience,pos,"Just amazing car!!!  I have always been a Porsche 911 loyalist and decided to check out this semi-exotic. I have been blown away. 

Using as my daily driver, the comfort and performance are unmatched together. The distinction in driving modes allows me to always find a level that suits my mood. 

Not quite understanding Edmunds 3 star rating when comparing to the competition, especially when you add in the Honda/Acura reliability to the equation. 

Yes, a bit more storage would be nice, the trunk should be better insulated against temperature, and they could have found a way to offer blind-spot monitoring, but for an everyday supercar that looks distinguished from the sea of Porsches and more common R8s which you can actually drive everyday, this is the real deal. "
acura,nsx,2017,Jeff Boldt, 08/28/2019,Very Happy With NSX,pos,"My wife and I love the looks of this white NSX with many carbon fiber highlights. It also goes like as Meatloaf says ""a bat out of hell"". My kids (30s) bring friends over for a ride. Electronics are good, but I'm having trouble getting the 10-years of free map updates to work or the garage door opener to work. Trunk looks small at first, but is very wide and as long as you use soft luggage (e.g. duffel bags) it holds plenty for several days of travel. Very easy to drive. My wife said she would never drive a super-car, but she drove it half of the way home from the dealer and said, ""It drives like a normal car"". Well unless you put your right foot down. It's quiet in sport mode, which I like. We love the red-black interior and the seats are very comfortable. It gets a lot of double-takes. I'm very happy with this purchase. 
"
acura,nsx,2020,Dan, 03/11/2020,Frighteningly Fast,pos,Go drive one. Make sure before you do you are cleared by your doctor and have no heart problem.
acura,rdx,2007,K Smith, 11/27/2015,225K and going strong,pos,"I've had no maintenance or repair problems with my RDX. All maintenance at Acura dealership. No repairs beyond scheduled service. Drive 25K/yr in Northern and Central Valley California. Most miles on I-5 at 70 mph. Also into Sierra foothills in light snow.  Acceleration is great entering highway and passing on 2 lane roads. 

Only negative comments -  suspension is very tight. Wonderful for cornering but bothersome on poor roadways at highway speed.  I still prefer it to my wife's 2007 MDX.   Premium fuel required but knew this when I bought it. Interior is great except center console armrest is thin vinyl that began to wear and tear after 4 years.   Mentioned to dealer and they acknowledged that other owners had same complaint. Overall great car, hoping to get 50K more on it waiting for Tesla Model 3.
"
acura,rdx,2007,binh, 01/17/2007,Best SUV for us!,pos,Me and my wife absolutely love this car. We were previous owners of an RX8 and making the switch to an suv/cuv we expected loss on the fun factor. Turns out this car is a lot of fun to drive and feels solid all around. Gas mileage has been around the 19/20mpg with mixed driving. Everything I had hoped for.
acura,rdx,2007,ECB, 12/06/2006,No substantial complaints. Great SUV,pos,"Purchased mine 2 weeks ago and have put on about 800 miles.  The RDX handles amazingly and accelerates extremely well, very much like a sports car and far better than any other SUV. The technology package is a must. Acura/Honda has the best navigation system around.  The handsfree capability is also impresive. Cargo room is good, as well is storage room in the RDX. Interior build quality is quite good; the leather seats are extermely comfortable. Sound system is, by far, the best I have heard in any car. I have averaged 21 mpg and I'm anticipating a slight gain when the car breaks in.  Please keep in mind that I do about 70% highway driving and I am a fairly conservative driver "
acura,rdx,2007,Charlie, 04/22/2016,THICK IN THIN RDX IS A GREAT QUALITY VEHICLE,pos,"The 2007 4 C Turbo eats premium gas in daily city grinding/driving.  HOWEVER - exceptional reliability, incredible performance in torrential rain (Upstate New York), lots of snow (upstate & downstate- NY blizzards), cruised through major hills (Smokey Mountain),  saved my life as well!  The exceptionally strong metals used around the ""passenger cage"" deflected a blown Truck Caliper that sharded and exploded ahead of me - tore through two other cars then into mine - did not penetrate into the cabin - only deflected through a part of the undercarriage and did minimal damage under the passenger door side.  138K miles, still runs beautifully.  Only major change was to the front struts recently (GET THE KYOBI BRAND MONROE DOES NOT FAIR WELL IN THIS CAR)- NYC POTHOLES) and all discs and Break pads from www.handa-accessories.com.  Mobil Synthetic Oil  - car still runs like new.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Acura Lover, 10/11/2010,Hard to Beat an Acura,pos,"This is my third Acura.  I traded a BMW X3si for this RDX.  I had the BMW only 5 months.  Before that, I had an Acura TL.  Always wanted a BMW until I actually owned one.  Proved to myself I am an Acura fan for life.  This is my first 4-cyl car.  Turbo makes it feel like a V6.  Comfortable ride, quality interior expected from an Acura.  Tech pkg is nice, but could be much improved.  Feel like I went downhill from the 03 TL to the 07 RDX on that end.  This RDX really makes me feel as though my TL got a face and body lift.  Don't miss the BMW one bit except for the Bluetooth.  I hate pressing the talk button for each and every command; even my 03 Yukon doesn't require that. "
acura,rdx,2007,cg, 01/21/2007,Why I bought this car over others,pos,"I have a BMW 323i and love it. I bought a lexus 330 3 years back b/c BMW does not do well in snow :) Lexus is a smooth car but NO excitment to drive.. I was looking for a car w/ good in the snow, comfortable to drive long distance, fun to drive, can hold 4 people comfortably, good cargo area - the RDX fit the bill for all these. Being a female, I find most of the SUVs are TOO big and too heavy for me. This car feels like a sports sedan, except that it is taller and wider.  The turbo give you the 'peep' of  sporty ride. Yes there is more driving noise then a Lexus, but it's a trade off for performance."
acura,rdx,2007,"My 3rd ""Honda""", 09/09/2010,Do your research,pos,"I bought a certified 2007 last month with 33k miles on it after lots of research.  This is a great car. Gets 20mpg city/hwy which is just what I hoped for with a 3900lb turbo vehicle. It handles like a dream. It hugs curves like no other. The ride is bumpy, but not as bad as other SUV/ CUVs I've been in.  This car is FAST! I'm not a lead foot, but I punched it a couple times and I was gone! The seats are comfortable and supportive. There's lots of leg room in the back. The cargo area with seats up or seats down is more than adequate for this class and  size of vehicle. This is a great vehicle for a family of 3. It nice after driving an Accord for 15 years not to see myself coming and going."
acura,rdx,2007,Josho, 12/11/2006,"Great crossover, a blast to drive.",pos,"This car is really fun to drive. There's basically no turbo lag; hit the gas, and off you go. It's surprisingly quick. The real joy comes from the SH-AWD system, which helps you stick to the road in any conditions, but especially when things get slick. The gas mileage is a bit worse than advertised, but still better than most, if not all, SUVs. The standard RDX comes with so much standard, you're better off buying a 3rd party nav system, and saving a bunch on the sticker. With so much standard, why pay another $4K for bluetooth and a back-up camera? Overall, a great buy at the standard level!"
acura,rdx,2007,dorianf, 11/22/2006,Terrific Alternative To German Models,pos,"I buy a new car every six to seven years, alternating with my spouse.  I bought the RDX with a need to buy something upscale and fun.  Also winter handling and cold weather features were other concerns.  Here was my must have list and what the RDX provided: heated seats, standard; heated outside mirrors (hate scraping), standard; AWD, standard, XM or Sirius radio; XM standard (better channels than Sirius and no Howard Stern); Bluetooth; standard; good acceleration; standard, and very good I might add; classy; standard - even without the BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes nameplate.  Okay, there was another sort of must-have that the RDX did not give me: auto-headlights."
acura,rdx,2007,Wayne Shaffner, 12/28/2006,My RDX,pos,"My RDX has many great technological features, however some important ones to me were left off. My TL had seat memory for the drivers seat. This was a great feature for me because people at the dealership move the seat all the time, and it takes me a week to get it perfect again. No power seat for the passenger is also missed by my wife. Drivers side mirror does not tilt down. Rear lift gate should be remote controlled both from the remote lock / unlock and the dash as the trunk was on the TL. "
acura,rdx,2007,harvey agustin, 11/24/2006,I love the sports mode of RDX,pos,It's fun to drive using the sports mode. I never had a car this fast and stable at high speeds. My average mileage after 3000 miles is around 17-18 miles per gallon both city and highway driving combined. 
acura,rdx,2007,changomo, 12/26/2006,No Brainer for *This* Segment,pos,"This is not the perfect car, but it is the perfect choice for the entry level small-luxo-SUV market.  Felt the RAV4 and CX7 were not as refined.   X3 is the only real competitor in this segment.  The X3 was a nice car, but would cost about $10K more similarly equipped.  I thought the ride was a bit fairer on the BMW, but I felt the handling and power on the RDX was superior.  It has ridicoulous amounts of technology, plenty of power, and sport-sedan like handling."
acura,rdx,2007,NorCalJ, 01/03/2007,First Tank RDX,pos,First tank 19.7 mpg mixed highway (60%) and city (40%) with some aggressive driving mixed with mostly conservative driving. Drove up to Tahoe in snow and the AWD worked great. Love the car so far. 
acura,rdx,2007,AJ22Flight, 01/31/2007,RDX Rocket!,pos,"I have owned this for a week now and I could not be more impressed with this car.  I traded my 2002 TL and can't believe how much better the RDX handles.  Acceleration is great for a two ton auto.  The fit and finish of the interior is second-to-none with a smartly designed cockpit and great seats.  I got the tech package and the ELS sound system rocks!  Nav is easy to use, handsfree bluetooth works like a charm.  I have read many reviews from others complaining about the gas mileage.  I am averaging 17.5 after 600 miles of mixed driving.  If you are constantly stomping on the gas (and jamming on your brakes) you'll get 12 mpg.  You only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo will move you!"
acura,rdx,2007,S. Banks, 03/16/2018,Most Reliable Vehicle I've Ever Owned!!!,pos,"I will definitely be replacing this vehicle with another Acura RDX.  Extremely reliable vehicle!
"
acura,rdx,2007,HowdyKeith, 01/16/2007,Cool Car!,pos,"My car is my office as I put a lot of miles on my car.  The RDX sold me on several points: 1) its outward style; 2) its interior design; 3) the Technology Package (outstanding audio and navigational system!); 4) the quality, fit, and finish of the interior materials; 5) the comfortable driver's seat; 6) its handling and performance; 7) the excellent warranty; 8) and Acura's reputation for building excellent cars and providing great service.  The RDX has been very fun to drive thus far.  Some might say that it drives too harsh; however, I am more than willing to sacrifice a little cushiness for the excellent handling and road feel the RDX provides.  Additionally, this car really turns heads! "
acura,rdx,2007,rcizme, 05/26/2009,Love my RDX,pos,"Although some call it an SUV it's not.  I don't drive it off road and don't plan to but on snow covered mountain roads it out handles my 4x4 Explorer in every way.  The SH-AWD is one of the best I've ever driven.  On performance, I didn't buy it as a race car but I drive over a mountain pass to work every day and this car doesn't work very hard climbing the grade AND with just over 50K miles, I'm averaging 24 MPG.  I'm confused as to why so many complain about poor fuel economy.  I'm guessing that mileage figures vary with driving habits?  It's not a race car... don't drive it like one."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX LOVER, 08/29/2009,I REALLY Know This Car,pos,"I'm a sales rep and drive approximately 40,000-45,000 miles a year for work. I've owned the RDX for a little more than two years and have 94,000 miles on it. I LOVE THIS CAR! The quality is excellent, the power & handling is excellent. The features of the tech pkg are great and reliable. I get compliments about this car all the time because of its styling and luxury. As long as you don't stand on the throttle and use up the turbo all the time, you get respectable gas mileage. I usually get 20-21 mpg in mixed driving conditions. When I'm aggressive I get 18-19 mpg. Due to a sporty suspension some may not like to feel every bump. You get a lot for the money. Compare the features to others."
acura,rdx,2007,mike, 11/06/2006,I Love My Techno RDX,pos,"I researched all the new models extensively before deciding on my purchase of the RDX with Technology package.  This is an incredible vehicle for the price.  The fit and finish are better than my last Mercedes ML, as is the technology and handling.  I've owned the vehicle for 6 weeks and still look for errands to run just for the fun of driving it."
acura,rdx,2007,palsons99, 12/18/2006,2007 Acura RDX,pos,"First off, there is no small SUV out there that is as fun to drive as this car. I tried the mazda and subaru equivalents, and they just don't match the feel of this car. This car is just a blast to drive. "
acura,rdx,2007,Dzenan, 12/30/2006,Great car for the money,pos,"I used to work for a valet parking co. and drove all kinds of cars, but nothing like this. The RDX has the punch, it is techno loaded, interior & exterior design is superb."
acura,rdx,2007,Mary , 01/20/2007,You'll fall in love...,pos,This vehicle handles like a dream. I was reluctant to purchase an SUV because of their traditional fuel consumption but this vehicle gets pretty decent milage. The interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius is awesome.  Safety was a big deal for me and the RDX has almost everything you could ask for in security at an affordable price.  This is my second Acura and it is every bit as impressive as the first.  There is also much to be said about the way Acura cares for their customers.  I'm an Acura customer for life.
acura,rdx,2007,Amy G Schmid, 09/19/2017,Sporty RDX,pos,"I have had my 2007 RDX since 2009. It is a beautiful, reliable car that hits high speeds with it's turbo engine that makes it fun to drive. The stereo is good, seats are comfortable and sunroof lets the sun in. I plan on driving this SUV until it decides to stop. I highly recommend this vehicle!
"
acura,rdx,2007,Doug Jordan, 07/05/2018,A 12 years' remembrance,pos,"It has remained exceptionally reliable.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Rusty, 11/27/2006,Super Fun to drive!,pos,I have had my RDX now for 1.5 months and I love it. It is the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned. The power is great! The cornering on snow and ice has been exceptional. I have already been through 3 blizzards! I never dreamed that this car would be so much fun! Sound system is the best ever experienced!
acura,rdx,2007,Ben, 12/19/2006,Special car,pos,"Have had the RDX tech package for about 2 months now. Love the bluetooth and other tech features. Car has the room I need without being too big. Would have preferred manual transmission. I find the car very comfortable, I see some complaints about the ride, I have had cars on either side of the RDX and personally wouldn't want to give up any of the fine handling that would undoubtedly be lost with a more plush ride. I would have considered the 21 MPG that I am getting fine several years ago. Next time around I can't imagine that I would even consider a car with this type of mileage. Very happy with RDX quality, feel, and image."
acura,rdx,2007,george, 08/10/2015,"after 9yrs/50k+ miles, i would buy it again",pos,"the first thing I said in my previous updates is still the first thing i have to say this time... ""quick"". this vehicle is very quick.

there is a slight turbo lag but when the turbo kicks in...you're gone. the quickness is maintained as long as you keep the turbo engaged. the quickness does not fade as your speed increases. and if you use the paddle shifters, forget about it. with the 4WD, even on wet surfaces, you get great acceleration and it handles very well.

the ride is very comfortable and the back seats sit higher than the front seats so you don't get that claustrophobic feeling. 

it's no wonder that acura doesn't make the tiny 2.3L 4cyl turbo SH-AWD anymore...probably couldn't sell their MDXs. 

I got my cruise control button fixed at the last review. still working.

since my last review, I had to find the broken wire causing my rear defroster failure. I had to recharge my a/c. a total of $180. both working.

also now the covering on the door armrest is peeling. that could be a lot my fault as it has to be pouring rain before I close my windows so it got wet frequently.

the only other interior problem is still minor, the covering on the center console arm rest has now pealed off entirely (JUST the covering, the cushioning and its covering are still intact and the arm rest is fully functional; just doesn't look great)  but otherwise the upholstery is in excellent condition. 

I STILL have ONLY 2 gripes with the car... premium gas for the turbocharger and the rear windows don't go all the way down. ya can't have it all.

if anyone is keeping track, I haven't changed my mileage in my reviews because I STILL haven't broken 80K miles. I am just over 78k now. I ride my bikes pretty much all the time, even to work.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Andy, 08/12/2016,Reliable and sporty small suv,pos,"This review is on my moms 2007 Rdx, bought new in 2006 on my recommendation, which I have driven on and off over the past 10 years, including 10 hour road tips, mountain ski trips in the snow, etc.  She now has around 100k miles on it and has not had a single trip for unscheduled maintenance in that time.  Acceleration is quick for an suv and the handling is sporty and precise.  Ride is quite firm, you will feel every bump in the road, but the chassis feels solid.  The sh-awd handles great in the snow and it was a great vehicle to take on ski trips.  Passenger and cargo space is reasonable and visibility is good.  Stereo is good and materials are nice but not overly luxurious.  Only negatives are requiring premium fuel for the turbo engine, and averaging only around 18mpg (90% stop and go city driving.). Road trips to the mountains I would be lucky to eek out 23-24 mpg.  Buy this for its Honda reliability and being fun to drive, not for its gas mileage.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Critical, 07/28/2009,The Family Sportscar!,pos,"Absolutely great car.  Tech package is easy to use.  Here's the bad things... interior plastic scratches easy, 19 to 20 mpg avg., 92 octane gas.  That being said this is the best car I've ever owned.  I'm a ""car nut"" and backyard mechanic, this car is extremely easy to maintain.  I'll drive this car till it dies!     "
acura,rdx,2007,jingo, 01/12/2007,Go!,pos,"I bought this car to replace a small hatchback that got totaled in an accident. I feel very comfortable with all its safety features, and it handles very well. I never was fan of SUVs, but I really love this car. I was looking at the BMW, but in the end I thought the RDX was simply a better ride. I also like the fact that I don't see these very often since it's a new model. I live in L.A., and I think I've only seen one or two others on the street. It's a very hip car!"
acura,rdx,2007,Mel Vento, 02/12/2019,Best car I've ever owned,pos,"I bought my 2007 new and it is now 12 years old and has 166,000 miles. Other than the airbag recall this car has had no mechanical issues which is amazing.  This is the most reliable car I have ever owned and so fun to drive.  The turbo and handling makes it feel like a race car and the safety rating was top of it's class.

acura,rdx,2007,stevieharris, 10/08/2006,Putrid gas mileage,neu,"Neat car, but stupendously bad gas mileage.  We got 11MPG on the first tank, 13MPG on the second tank and have not hit more than 13MPG since.  This is computing MPG the old fashioned way.  Our local dealer (PA) has more than 20 of these on the lot unsold, they said that they ""had deposits"" on them, but they don't.  I see why now.  Like the car, but this gas mileage is just really, really, really bad."
acura,rdx,2007,Blueman, 02/07/2018,Gas Hog!!,pos,"The Car is very Nice, Except for the Poor Gas Mileage!!!!  Running on Premium Gas the four cylinder turbo sucks up the gas, I only get 20 Highway - 11 in town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
acura,rdx,2007,rsbell, 08/12/2006,Great SUV,pos,"I've only owned the vehicle for 1 day, but have put 300 miles on it.  There IS some turbo lag, but once the turbo winds up, you're pressed to the back of your seat.  A bit smaller than I expected, but appears to have ample rear space, especially with the back sets folded flat.  Very nice, leather.  The tech package is with voice control is very detailed, and very complicated.  Will definitely take a few good days of use to get all of the commands andm options down, but looks to be well worth the effort."
acura,rdx,2007,ever_green, 05/09/2009,Best CUV out there for the Money,pos,"This car is great. Oops I mean SUV. Well same thing real for this ""CUV"". Sometimes you forget it's an SUV with its excellent acceleration and sport suspension. You feel the road unlike any other SUV out there. It feels more like my friend's BMW 3s. Apart from performance Acura offers excellent interior design with everything you need, really. Comfortable heated leather seats, Dual zone AC & so on...The super handling AWD also helps on snow and offroad. even though this car is not designed for offroading I still do it and it feels just as good as my highlander on dirt and light muddy roads. Only thing I'm unhappy about is the MPG in hwy. I get 21MPG."
acura,rdx,2007,Debbie, 03/03/2018,Love it,pos,"I still love my ride smooth and attractive

acura,rdx,2007,Acuralover, 10/08/2006,Surprising disappointment from Acura,neu,"I've owned 5 Honda and Acura products before, and this is a HUGE disappointment!! The 4-banger feels sluggish from a standstill (although it's reasonably quick after the initial lag). The engine is very noisy during acceleration, with a lot of turbo whine (even under some cruising conditions) which ""wears down on you"" after a while. And I was SHOCKED by the horrendous fuel economy. At 16 mpg overall (mix of hwy/city), it's exactly the same as my other vehicle: V8 powered Lexus GX470! Isn't this supposed to be a 4 CYLINDER, SMALL SUV? Helllooo!!"
acura,rdx,2007,rskdsk, 08/17/2006,"Fun SUV, but gas milage could be better",pos,"It is really to early to tell alot, however my first tank of gas seem to yield me only 13.5MPG ... and I did not dog the SUV.  This may be because the engine needs to break in, but with my last acura (MDX) getting poor gas milage, I am starting to see a trend.  This vehicle is very confortable and the handeling is great (for a SUV).  The exterior could be better, but still very nice.  I paid just over sticker ($150) ... not bad so far.  The brakes seem a bit weak, but again they may need to seat and the intial take off torque is nonexisitant, but once the turbo spools, it has a good punch."
acura,rdx,2007,Alex Harris, 09/05/2006,Bad gas mileage,pos,"The gas mileage on this car is horrific.  The EPA is 19/23 but thus far we have had no tank higher than 13 MPG and our average is 12.8 MPG.  I took the car to the dealer and they said that ""the gas mileage on the RDX isn't great"".  Wow is that an understatement.  If I had known that the mileage would be this bad I would never have purchased this car.  The car is great otherwise, but it only takes premium gasoline and the gas costs are now more than double my prior car (a V6 Honda Accord).  I am really disappointed that Acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no way out now, I estimate that my additional annual gas costs will be about $2500 per year, which is insane."
acura,rdx,2007,NemoUmbra, 09/29/2006,Base 2007 Acura RDX (CAN),pos,Car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too harsh at times for normal day to day driving.  Gas mileage has been quite reasonable (12.3L/100km or 19.1 mpg) but I've had to watch the turbo indicator to use the turbo as little as possible.  Hills seem to make the turbo kick in quite a bit as expected which really drains the gas quite quickly.  Cruising at relatively high speeds while feathering the gas to keep up with traffic seems to make the turbo kick in oddly causing seemingly choppy driving.  Blind spots are quite minimal as the mirrors and small size help counteract this.
acura,rdx,2007,idr, 10/11/2006,Good but needs improvement,neu,"Before buying, I really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto the closest freeway with no radio on.   I was very annoyed with a shaking/vibrating steering wheel every time I waited in front of the red light.  During acceleration, I found the turbo to be rather loud.  The gas mileage could also be improved.  On the other hand, great visibility and comfortable seats in both front and back.  Excellent design as well.  The ride is also very comfortable when compared to a sport X3.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Brillo, 11/28/2006,"Great handling, poor mileage",pos,"The car is fun to drive, handles very well, excellent quality and features. Only disappointment is a 3+ MPG gap in rated numbers versus actual. Avg 19-20 in semi rural and highway driving.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Glen, 12/25/2015,"Japanese quality, German performance",pos,"The 2007 model drives and handles like a 5 series BMW. The seats hold you securely on spirited curves. Later models were softened up and ""family car"" dumbed down. If you want fun, get a 2007. If you want a polite quality family car, get a later model.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Phundriver , 11/27/2019,"Reliable, Safe, Sporty!",pos,"The 2007 Turbo RDX SWX is by far the best vehicle I’ve owned following Audi, Mercedes, Lexus.  Buy it if you can find it!  Premium sound!  Handles like a sports car.  Drives like a smooth limo.  Again, if you find one in good well maintained shape.  BUY!  "
acura,rdx,2007,The Boss, 01/19/2007,The funnest car to drive,pos,"The car is great. It drives like a sports car, but it is a safe, small suv. Highly recommended."
acura,rdx,2007,diamondpearl, 10/21/2006,My point of view of RDX,neu,"It's been about 2 month since I purchased 07 RDX right after debut. I have really good image of honda also I had Acura RSX type S before and really liked it. That is why I decided to buy RDX. I am well satisfied with my purchase; however, I see the car is not well built. I happened to find many rattles from dashboards, passenger seat, and twitters. I hate that ticking sounds that dashboards makes.  This year RDX missing few things, and I dont see how a car at this pricepoint does not have these as standards: passenger power seat, memory seat for driver seat, auto-dim back and side mirrors."
acura,rdx,2007,Terrible car, 08/05/2010,Worst car ever purchased,neg,"In the first 3 months this brand new car was in the shop for electronic malfunctions, sunroof malfunction, rear hatch cracked, turbo replaced, warning light indicator malfunction, ""flooding issues"" and engine noise.  This has been our worst experience with a car purchase, Acura service was terrible along with Acura Canada's response.  I would NOT recommend this car, it is noisy, rough and unreliable."
acura,rdx,2007,Bink, 11/26/2006,Boutique SUV,neg,"Poor gas mileage on premium - 18.3 MPG on mostly freeway driving.  I used to average 16.9 MPG with my 4.7 L Jeep 4x4.  Very uncomfortable ride on 18"" tires - bounces down the road.  No interior space or trunk space in spite of being longer than my Grand Cherokee.  It feels like you're in an airplane cockpit.  No pep when you step on it.  High maintenance cost as it requires premium and special oil, 4 times the cost of regular oil.  I can't wait to get rid of it in the spring."
acura,rdx,2007,def, 10/21/2006,Love it!,pos,We love our RDX.  I no longer mind driving anywhere.  It is fun to drive and I feel very safe.  With the fold down seats I can haul a lot.  This car is so comfortable and has a great sound system.
acura,rdx,2007,rdxster, 10/23/2006,A great SUV - fun to drive,pos,We picked it up this weekend and so far it's been all fun. This is a great SUV and drives like a sports car. We had a Maxima GLE but this has way more zip and is great in cornering and feel.
acura,rdx,2007,Greg B, 11/21/2006,Loving it so far,pos,"Have been ""in love"" since seeing first RDX on highway more than a month ago.  Picked mine up (black, tan interior) last week, and have been smiling ever since.  Cannot recommend it enough. "
acura,rdx,2007,sad rdx, 05/31/2008,Turbo is design flaw,neg,"Be very careful of the RDX: the front end has a problem that will need to be addressed - it feels a little like the shocks but it isn't.  The turbo has a major problem - my car has been in the shop for over a week they are tearing it down and do not have any idea what is wrong; no warning indicators it may have cracked the head but the dealership isn't talking.  They do not know why the turbo is malfunctioning but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for major issues of course that is when the warranty expires.  Powertrain is 70,000.  Everytime I have had to deal with warranty issues (3 dealerships) they try not to fix.  Good luck sorry you have this car and sorry I have this car.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Turbo Fan, 05/08/2009,Want a sport sedan needed an suv,pos,"I chose the RDX because I wanted sport sedan like handling and power but the utility of an SUV. Gas mileage is not as bad as some say. If I ease into the throttle, I can get about 25mpg highway with some city driving. Ride is firm, but you get lots of grip. Sport mode tranny is neat but not necessary. This is my first turbo engine and overall I like the power surge; surprising that a 2.3L can feel this strong in a 3,900lb vehicle. Turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 CX7 and 2009 Subaru Forester I drove. RDX felt more powerful than CX7 despite having less advertised hp and one fewer gear. Glad I spent the extra money and chose the RDX over the CX7.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Chapel Hill, 05/22/2009,Excellent peformance crossover,pos,"We purchased an '07 RDX brand new when they first came out (we purchased in Aug '06).  We are in the process of selling it, not because we want to, but because our family has simply outgrown it.  We put 40k miles on it in almost 3 years of ownership and have thoroughly enjoyed the RDX.  We've used it around town & on family trips.  Extremely reliable.  Quiet ride.  Incredibly comfortable interior w/ awesome styling.  Multiple compartments for storage, & many tech features.  Front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat (2/3 / 1/3) to expand cargo space.  The AWD RDX drives better than most performance cars - handling is incredible & it is a fun, solid drive/ride."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX, 08/21/2006,RDX First in Colorado,pos,"Just bought one of the first in Colorado. It's awesome! Fun to drive, decent gas mileage, looks great inside and out! TONS of power for a 4cyl. Deffinately recommend buying..."
acura,rdx,2007,Eric, 08/22/2006,2007 RDX with Tech Pkg.,pos,"An exceptionally fun to drive small suv with technology that will make you grin. Abundant power that is enjoyable but takes some getting used to. The turbo feels well tuned and is mild at first then spools up to deliver smooth, lag free acceleration. It's Nav system and voice recognition software really work well. The stereo is so good you'll be the envy of not just audiophiles but anyone with ears! It's better than the several thousand dollar aftermarket set up I have in my other vehicle.  Basically, consider it an impressive blend of MDX utilty, TSX performance and RL luxury.   "
acura,rdx,2007,betsy_me, 09/05/2006,13.65 MPG,pos,"Car is great BUT gas mileage is terrible.  Dealer says to wait until 2000 miles before bringing it in, but we have 1300 miles on it coming back from a trip north, and we cannot break 14 MPG.  Most of the drive was highway."
acura,rdx,2007,TColeman, 09/28/2006,Great Crossover SUV,pos,"My wife wanted her latest vehicle to be an SUV.  After looking at a few and noting the sticker price, we decided to test drive the RDX.  Hands down it drove and felt better than a Toyota Highlander and Mazda CX-7.  The engine has plenty of pep, the interior has plenty of luxury, and the Tech package has plenty of toys.  The HandsFree Link for a Bluetooth phone works great and the voice-activate NAV system is impressive...lots of voice commands to learn.  No problems with gas mileage. We are very pleased with our first venture into a luxury line of automobiles."
acura,rdx,2007,k, 10/06/2006,"Fun to drive, poor mpg",neu,"Great pickup and handling for an SUV. The tech gadgets are fun.  My first tank of gas gave me 16 mpg - my Porsche gets 19 mpg combo and 27 mpg freeway. It makes me wonder what Acura was thinking when they designed this engine. If the mpg doesn't go near the lowest stated mpg after break-in, then there is a problem."
acura,rdx,2007,Bryan, 10/09/2006,24 MPG on the HWY,pos,I have made 2 round trip between Baton Rouge and New Orleans driving on Interstate 10. The trip computer said that I was getting 24.1 MPG @ 65 MPH. I didn't notice any turbo lag when I punched it while driving around town. Steering pulls to the right somewhat. Don't know if it is an alignment problem or not.
acura,rdx,2007,Vern from Florida, 10/26/2006,2007 RDX Tech deluxe,pos,"I use on line reviews a lot but don't often have time to give back. I'd like to here. This is my 5th Acura and first SUV. I traded a 2005 RL which was nice but not nearly as much fun and functional as this. It's fun, cool and for a 56 year old guy, it fits my needs perfectly. Who says it has to go to upwardly mobile 30ish types?"
acura,rdx,2007,On the road again, 11/13/2006,RDX - let 'er roll,pos,Purchased an RDX two weeks ago. Previously owned a Honda CRV and loved it.  Wanted to upgrade and stay with a Honda.  Getting 22 mpg for normal highway driving.  Could easily get less with the peppy turbo if you stand on it.  Great handling both on straightaways and curves and a solid built vehicle.  A litte stiff ride but quiet interior with awesome stereo system.  Love the navigation system but it takes some time to learn the commands. Bluetooth is awesome and great for making/answering calls while traveling.  Tilt down right passenger mirror is helpful when backing as well as rear viewing camera. Gauges are well placed and lighted both day and night.  Overall pleased so far.
acura,rdx,2007,Curtis, 11/17/2006,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",pos,"I had been looking for a tall (better line of sight) performance vehicle that has better interior and comfort than the X3.  It turns out that the RDX has a much nicer interior and ride.  I am very happy with the price and value of this terrific car.  I do not notice any turbo lag.  I do notice that it accelerates like a jet and handles like a nimble sedan.  To quote Burgess Meredith: ""It eats lightning and craps thunder!""  It is the younger, faster, and more fun brother to my RX 330!  The stereo even sounds incredible and has sold me on xm radio!"
acura,rdx,2007,Charles Hatley, 11/16/2006,So fun to drive,pos,I love pulling up to people in sports cars at red lights and knowing how surprised they are when my little SUV takes off like a rocket!  This is the most fun drive I've ever had.  The quality of the interior is incredible... blows my old VW away!
acura,rdx,2007,GNV, 01/16/2007,Great Car,pos,Technology package is superb. Fit and finish interior also superb. Seats are very comfortable - esp given size of car. Only problem is gas mileage and it requires premium fuel. If Acura corrects this they would have a more sought after car.
acura,rdx,2007,lukeivic, 06/23/2007,Performance,pos,"My husband already owns the Acura TL.  So we wanted the MDX (awesome vehicle too).  But we saw the RDX - good price, great quality and it had all of the bells and whistles as the MDX.  I have been driving it since January and I love it.  It is everything they said it would be. However, it is a ladies car because of the size.  You have a luxury car for a great price.  "
acura,rdx,2007,J. Wood, 10/17/2007,"""A Well Kept Secret""",pos,"I knew this was the car for me the first time I test drove it. I tried other small SUVs in this range, i.e, Lexus, Murano, and there was no comparison.  This car has a solid compact feeling.  I was not aware of this car. Someone talked me into seeing it. It's a quality car and handles well in bad road conditions (heavy rain storms and wind).  I love the turbo power when I need to accelerate in traffic. The interior is classy & the techology is state of the art. I highly recommend this car.  It's fun to drive - I look forward to driving everyday."
acura,rdx,2007,FTNSS1, 11/15/2007,I'm in love....,pos,"I traded an '05 TSX for the RDX - needed more room for gear.  Not only is the RDX just the right size, it's actually MORE fun to drive!!  The SH-AWD system produces such grip and control that it almost feels like you're driving a sports car.  I've had no problems/repairs, the mileage is acceptable for an SUV (about 21 mpg), and the fun factor is a 10!  The ride is firm, but comfortable.  The interior is great (and versatile), the technology package is great."
acura,rdx,2007,Chad, 03/20/2008,This is a Driver's SUV,pos,"This car has been so fun to drive. Lots of reviews about the stiff ride, but that is one of the things I like about the car. Leather is very nice. Lots of fun gadgets, and voice command works very well. This car offers more for the money than any of its competitors, especially the overpriced BMW X3. If you have a family with a bunch of kids, get the GMC Acadia or Mazda CX-9 in this price-range. But for the young professional looking for an entry-level luxury SUV, this is the bomb. Even if I was willing to pay more for a car, I would still end up with the RDX, that's how much I've loved it. My wife drives a new audi, and has been jealous since I bought this. "
acura,rdx,2007,PaulT, 03/21/2008,Road Warriors Dream,pos,"Test drove Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, Range Rover and found the RDX beat them all. Performance, quality and driveability all exceeded my demands. Gas mileage has been an avg of 20 mpg. I spend 3-5 hours a days behind the wheel and this is an awesome ride. Just love it. "
acura,rdx,2007,michael, 04/23/2008,The Best of Both Worlds,pos,"I have been in the car business 18 years, and have had a few front drive cars and 4 rear drive pathfinders.  One day I was driving a front drive passenger vehicle and took a corner to fast and the rest is history.  That day I test drove the 07 RDX SW AWD and the rest is history. I have never owned an all wheel drive vehicle with VSA.  Being in the business, I have driven this vrossover hard.  It corners better than any thing I have ever driven. Bring on the rain.  Floor it from a dead stop and the car just launches forward, comfortable on long trips, the navigation is great."
acura,rdx,2007,Very Very Unhappy, 05/05/2008,In the shop three times already,neu,In the last Month my RDX has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with Japan now and still have no idea what's wrong. I'm probably going to trade it in once the find the problem. I can not trust this car. I thought Acura was a trusted car that had no problems I guess I was wrong.
acura,rdx,2007,Gaye Brown, 04/15/2018,Speedy luxury suv,pos,"Wonderful car for hauling customers around and to get to appointments in traffic.

acura,rdx,2007,jjc, 07/15/2010,Well balanced and fun to drive!,pos,"We just got this car used several weeks ago and are thrilled with it!  It is very fun to drive and has a nice kick. The car is a great balance of size, speed, practicality, and fun.  Plus, it looks sharp and is fast!  Both my wife and I love it. "
acura,rdx,2007,black satin, 11/02/2006,Quick midsize SUV,pos,I purchased the black satin looks great in that color. Quality compares to no other. Tech pkg. is the best out there.
acura,rdx,2007,Robert Small, 11/20/2006,Scratch Scratch Scratch,pos,"I drove a Volvo for 12 years and needed a change. The Acura attracted me because it was small. I also owned a Honda in the past.  The car handles well and dazzles but there is absolutely no body protection. It's a joke.  Everytime we park, the car boasts a new ding or dent. They should think about some body trim.  "

acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 02/22/2009,Floor Mat,neu,"This is my first and last Acura.  At 5K the driver's floor mat was worn through.  After some argument, the dealer agreed to replace it under warranty. The replacement lasted about the same.  While the overall interior quality appears acceptable, the carpeting and floor mats are very cheap.  Mileage is fair, but you must use premium fuel.  For the money, the vehicle is not worth the price."
acura,rdx,2007,Steve Cohen, 03/27/2016,Nice car until turbo failed,neg,"Check engine light came on at 92000 miles. The dealer diagnosed a failing turbo, around $4500 to fix. I don't expect a premium car to fail at this mileage. Also the ride is fairly harsh as is road noise. Fun to drive though. New Mercedes is so much nicer it revealed to me how crude this is and how much fatigue it caused on long trips.
"
acura,rdx,2007,susan, 10/09/2006,Fueled with fun,pos,"Fun car to drive traded in a 2002 TL was sort of nervous to get an SUV but have no regrets.  Quick, corners nicely, fuel economy could be better but then if I wanted fuel economy I should have bought a hybrid."
acura,rdx,2007,pete, 11/01/2006,So Far - So good,pos,So Far my RDX is working as advertised.  It handles well and is very responsive. I have the tech package and would highly recommend the addition.
acura,rdx,2007,mlb11, 02/25/2007,Awesome vehicle,pos,"I've owned the RDX for a month now and I still can't wait to drive it - I look for excuses. It handles magnificently and the turbo provides impressive power. Interior fit and finish is top notch and the seats are comfortable. When cruising at 80 it feels like you're doing 50 because it is so quiet and refined (the 4-cyl is only tach'ing 2800 at 80mph). Great handling and cornering as well with a ride that makes you feel in control. Driven it in two snowstorms and the SH-AWD & VSA performed excellently, keeping the car straight and in control."
acura,rdx,2007,MattAZ, 08/22/2007,Too Fun To Drive,pos,"Beside this being my 3rd Honda product (2000 Accord Coupe and then 2005 Acura TSX), I was looking for a bigger car than the TSX, but still wanted that performance and sportiness found in the TSX. The Lexus and BMW equivalents to the RDX can't even compare and the RDX is even more fun to drive than the TL! There are only a few improvements I would like to see, but overall, I have yet to be displeased by this car. Fast, sporty, good looking and yet extremely safe for the family and it has AWD - for a price of under 35K, you can't beat it. MPG for one year has averaged 19.8 - not bad. The car performs totally different in auto versus manual/paddle shifters. "
acura,rdx,2007,CB, 09/11/2007,Be careful of roof,neg,"We bought a new RDX two months ago and now have been hit with a $4,500 bill to repair the roofs complete collapse. We mounted a bike rack on the roof, virtually identical to the one Acura sells as an RDX accessory. My son got on the roof to make sure that the bikes were placed in the rack properly  just like weve done on other cars weve owned with bike racks. This turned out to be a giant mistake, even though Acura never states anywhere that you shouldnt do this. This time though the weak, badly- designed Acura roof collapsed. Acura will not cover this huge expense  so much for customer service. My advice: dont buy this car; especially if youre putting something on the roof."
acura,rdx,2007,crvols, 06/18/2008,"After One Year, love the Car",pos,"I bought this last year trading in my 2004 TL.  I have enjoyed it from the start, with no problems and average of 22 mpg on the road.  I wish they hadn't scrimped on things like interior lighting, passenger power seat, auto dimming mirror, etc., but that seems to be Honda's marketing approach.  At the end of the model run it will have everything you would expect!  Overall very happy after the first year with my purchase."
acura,rdx,2007,johnnymauler, 07/02/2008,The good and the bad.,pos,"After owning this vehicle for a year I am already tired of the non responsive automatic transmission.  I have driven manual transmissions for most of my life, but I wanted to have a SUV for the snow and portability.  I have to say I love everything else about this vehicle.  The handling is great, comfortable, roomy, tech package kicks, even the turbo 4 isn't so bad.  But the paddle shifters and transmission are sub par.  Shifts are slow and sloppy.  This vehicle should have made with a 6 spd manual.  Also the GPS is outdated."
acura,rdx,2007,HondaMoCoFan, 10/03/2008,The Little Things Add Up,neu,"I decided to trade in my TL for this because I wanted all wheel drive. I was disappointed to find out that the car lacked some features I thought would be standard across all models. Namely, the navigation screen was no longer touch screen (as my TL from a few years prior had been). I also found both the gas range prediction and mpg to be terrible. On a drive across the country in a torrential downpour, I checked my range vs. the nearest gas station. At the time (about 20 miles away), I had about 12-15 extra miles according to the trip computer. Suddenly, about 10 miles away it jumped to 9 miles and I wondered if I would even make it."
acura,rdx,2007,LoveACURA, 05/05/2009,Spoiled Honda Owner,pos,"I owned Hondas for years but strayed to AUDI a few years ago.  I loved the AWD of my AUDI but hated the UNreliability - I'll NEVER have another Audi. Finding AWD for under $40K was a challenge. LOVE my RDX - a suped-up Honda with AWD!  All the bells and whistles of a more expensive model but at a great price.  Gas mileage is wonderful when I drive it like a 4 cyl. When I need the power of a 6 cyl, I have it with the Turbo. Drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about the gas mileage.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Chuck W., 02/17/2008,Look elsewhere,neg,"Acura is a luxury brand, but this is not a worthy model.  It's quick and sporty with a stiff ride.  But gas mileage was terrible and we had to replace the front brakes and rotors every 5000 miles.  We never felt like it did anything well. If you drove it as a sports SUV with paddle shifters, you paid at the pump and in maintenance.  Also, missing some key features at this price including automatic headlights, driver memory settings and iPod interface."
acura,rdx,2007,Eric, 08/21/2006,Awesome IS RDX,pos,This Car says it all RDX is the most incredible suv on steroids the ride is superb and the agility witht ht sh-awd doesn;t make you move when you make a sharp turn just eay and pleasant...Awesome tag to high but still KICKS RDX
acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 08/27/2006,Fun ride!,pos,"I have just taken an RDX for a test drive. The engine is very peppy once it gets into turbo zone. On the downside, the gas mileage is negatively affected by the AWD that cannot be switched off. Another necessary improvement deals with the cargo space (my current TL has a larger trunk). Also, the back seats do not fold down, so there is no way in which you can expand the cargo space (why call it an SUV then?).  Overall, the new RDX is a fine car!"
acura,rdx,2007,William, 08/31/2006,RDX REVIEW,pos,We fell in love with this new SUV as soon as we saw it. Drives like a dream and is very quick and responsive. The interior is very plush. Great SUV..
acura,rdx,2007,Bob, 09/02/2006,Exceptional Quality,pos,"This is my 5th Acura. The drivability wasn't as smooth as some other SUVs I've driven but considering the ""sports package"" it's understandable. Power galore for a 4 cylinder. Maybe a bit overpriced but you get what you pay for."
acura,rdx,2007,Andy, 09/08/2006,All I can say is WOW!,pos,From the first moment I test drove this vehicle I was very impressed. It's amazing how much HP a 4 cylinder with a turbo can give you and not to mention the decent gas mileage. The handle on this vehicle is awesome compared to other small suvs thanks to its sh-awd.
acura,rdx,2007,SyracuseAcura, 09/09/2006,No Compromise,pos,After extensive driving I noted that the RDX really shines in a wide range of driving scenarios.  The rear seats DO fold down for a very flexible interior and abundant cargo room.  The car actually gets quieter over the break in period and it is a vehicle that definitely grows on you.  The performance and handling is impressive for a sport sedan let alone an SUV.  Get one and have fun.
acura,rdx,2007,Tom from New Jersey, 09/13/2006,One Terrific Small SUV,pos,"I wanted a small but very luxious SUV and the Acura RDX is the answer. I've owned my RDX for two weeks and I couldn't be happier. I was a little skeptical of going back to a 4 cylinder engine (even though I had owned many 4 cylinder cars in the past) since many newer small SUVs have 6s in them. However, so far I am thrilled with the performance. I have 450 miles on the car and have been averaging better than 22 miles per gallon. The quality of construction and interior cockpit materials are top notch.  I highly recommend this car if you want a superior small SUV with far more in the way of goodies (I have the technology package) than the BMW X-3 for about $4000 less in price. "
acura,rdx,2007,Lewis, 09/18/2006,Awesome High Tech SUV,pos,"I've had my RDX for two weeks and love it!  It's plenty powerful, has loads of futuristic technology, including a voice recognition system which works very well, and is lots of fun to drive.  I'm getting 23 comfortable miles per gallon around town and on the highway.  I looked at other SUVs and was impressed with the Acura's quality, performance and high tech features.   "
acura,rdx,2007,Cdangelo, 09/20/2006,The TRUTH about the gas mileage,pos,"I don't know how people are reporting milage in the 12-14 mpg range.  I drove an RDX from Albany, NY to Utica, NY and got 24 mpg with the cruise set at 70 mph.  This past weekend, on a trip to the lake, I got 20.7 avg.  I was going through the mountains.  In order to get 12-14 mpg, a person must be mashing to pedal and driving on the turbo constantly.  Also, the rear seats DO fold down, so who ever said they didn't, must not own the vehicle which they posted a review about."
acura,rdx,2007,Fast Freddy, 09/25/2006,Car of the Year 2007,pos,I have had my RDX for 3 weeks. It drives excellently. Acura is #1 in technology and luxury. Drive this SUV and fall in love with it.
acura,rdx,2007,Stevie, 09/22/2006,It's a great little SUV,pos,"I am very impressed and happy about this little car. Fun to drive and a lot of power for a 4-cylinder car. The Turbo really makes the difference. The fuel economy for the first 2 tanks of gasoline is not good, then as the car breaks-in, the mileage gets better. Nicely made and stylish. Love it."
acura,rdx,2007,Pacific, 09/23/2006,Great new SUV,pos,"Just a great car, and an even better value.  Very quick, responsive and fun to drive.  Have put over 2000 miles on it in less than a month while averaging a shade less than 22 MPG. No Turbo lag at all.  The gadgets are great especially the superb audio system, the rear camera, the voice activated controls and the traffic info.  Acuras have always been reliable and I expect no difference here. "
acura,rdx,2007,CJ, 09/25/2006,"Awesome, BUT missing a few critical options",pos,"Ok, if you have not driven an RDX, go do it now.  This is an awesome machine.  Yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop, but you will be amazed how much power this little engine has, it really moves well.  The SH-AWD is just incredible, I took curves at 65 mph and you can see on the display which wheel is getting power, it is simply amazing.  I love all the tech gadgets, I am a gadget freak.  BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I WISH THEY CAN FIX.... one, NO MEMORY SEATS, what's up with that, this is a LUXURY brands, PLEASE give us memory driver's seat.  NO AC VENTS for the poor people in the back. Come on!!! a chevy has that.  Why can't Acura match the pwhite bumper to the white body.UGH"
acura,rdx,2007,Ed in Illinois, 09/27/2006,My First SUV,pos,"This is my 1st SUV and my 1st Acura. I couldn't be happier. The car is a blast to drive (love the turbo) and handles great. I wanted an AWD for the northern IL winters and the SH-AWD should be perfect. Interior looks and feels very nice and quality is heads above other SUVs that I test drove. The sound system is the biggest suprise. I read how good it was, but you cannot believe it until you actually hear it. The DVD-nav works great and helped me avoid a traffic jam driving home from the dealer the day I bought it. Highly recommended car."
acura,rdx,2007,Wedgebolt, 09/28/2006,WWWWOOOOOOWWWWWWWW,pos,I went in to the dealership just looking to test drive the RDX and ended taking one home. The RDX drives more like a sports car and I had to catch myself this morning when I was doing 90 mph without even feeling like I was speeding. Interior is well constructed but I feel like I am in a spaceship with all the buttons and features on this vehicle.
acura,rdx,2007,Bill, 10/04/2006,Great Car,pos,"Having driven Audi A8s for the last 9 years, I was a bit daunted by the thought of going to a smallish SUV.  But I wanted something smaller and better suited to a less formal lifestyle, and the RDX fit the bill. It is one great car!  Handling, performance, all are great.  The Technology Package is fantastic - voice recognition commands make using the Nav system a piece of cake.  And the sound system is the best I have ever heard in a car - it will blow you away, literally.  The XM radio is also super - digital surround sound must be heard to be believed."
acura,rdx,2007,drtimko, 10/04/2006,Great car but 18 MPG,pos,"Great car and just bought it last week.  I use it for business as a home care doctor, but 18 MPG is killing me.  The ride is great and acceleration is awesome with turbo.  The seats are a hard ride and wish they were softer.  Great interior look.  Best car in mini SUV category for the money.  Drove a 3 series BMW last car and this car handles very well.  Bluetooth not compatible with most Sprint phones.  That needs to be updated because Sprint big in my area."
acura,rdx,2007,NYC=Fun, 10/05/2006,Technology is fun,pos,"It's not often that I take the time to write about anything, however this crossover with the Tech. Package is a must. I have a Lexus RX and it doesn't hold a candle to the RDX. If you are looking for a sport car/suv you must test drive this one. You will be sold."
acura,rdx,2007,Dan, 10/05/2006,RDX,pos,"I wanted a sports car but needed the room of an SUV.  It performs like a sports car with agility, quickness and handling but offers more comfort than a sports car.  I evaluated the competitors but they could not compare for the difference in price.  I am satisfied!  "
acura,rdx,2007,patentcad, 10/09/2006,RDX exceeding expectations so far,pos,"It's impossible to convey the RDX's overall excellence in a brochure or 10 min test drive. After a week I'm THRILLED. More like an AWD TL station wagon. An SUV that out performs many sports sedans and handles like a Porsche 944. Superb passenger comfort. You sacrifice a little in the cargo area dept., but the car is perfectly adequate for our needs. We installed Thule cross bars and attachments to the factory roof rack. Fuel economy? I'm getting 17-18 city, 22-23 hwy and about 20 mpg combined. That will improve once the engine breaks in. On the gas guzzler issue - compare the RDX to real world mpg from other AWD wagons/small SUVs and you'll find it's better than most of them."
acura,rdx,2007,Falloonrd1, 10/10/2006,Acura RDX,pos,I am very impressed with this vehicle.  I had an 04 TSX and wanted something a little bigger.  The interior controls are well placed and easy to use.  The Nav is a lot better.  You can feel and hear the nice turbo engine.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on fuel ecomomy.
acura,rdx,2007,gomboy60, 10/12/2006,Fun car with lots of extra,pos,"Just got it the other day and I am very happy with the car. There are some complaints about the mpg but if one does not step on the accelerator all the time, (as any other car) the number should be very good. The ride is a bit bouncy at times but handling is superb. There is so much kick in the engine you won't even know it is I4. If you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market, take a test drive and you will be sold, esp with tech package. It provides everything and more at 12-14K less than that European ""thing"". Ext looks appears to be small but once inside, there is plenty of room. Happy motoring...  "
acura,rdx,2007,Zel, 10/19/2006,Fun to Drive,pos,"A great SUV.  My first Acura and SUV.  My family had a long h/o driving Mazdas but the CX-7 or Murano were no match.  The interior is just right and the body design turns heads.   I purchased 18"" Inspyre RonJon rims and they look great.  A definite recommendation to make it a bit sportier helped a bit.  As a single male in his 30s I am the demo they were going for and they succeeded!!"
acura,rdx,2007,Michael, 10/23/2006,RDX is Rockin!,pos,"Just purchased an RDX w/ tech - definitely worth the additional $3k.  Handles well, navigation, voice, gadgets are awesome.  First tank of gas was 21 mpg.  Turbo definitely works!  As long as you're not looking to haul anything or carry 10 people, definitely look at the RDX as an alternative to any SUV on the market."
acura,rdx,2007,J in AZ, 10/29/2006,I'm in Love!,pos,"I've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that I do not like about it (2500 miles so far).  Yes, it gets between 18-20 MPG, but considering the 15 MPG I was getting with my minivan, I'm certainly not complaining.  I don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 MPG, but I've been pretty much right on the rating for the vehicle.  Love it!"
acura,rdx,2007,dostoyevsky77, 11/04/2006,"Fun car, but missing some small things",pos,"I bought this car for my wife.   First, this ""car"" is awesome.  It handles like it wants to be a sports sedan, but it has the luxury and utility to make it one of the best crossovers we test drove.  The peppy turbocharger makes it jump off the mark, and the ""super handling all wheel drive"" really improves the cornering.  Watch out for the AWD status display on the dash; you should have your eyes on the road whenever you actually need the torque to be redistributed!"
acura,rdx,2007,Tami, 11/06/2006,Love It !!,pos,Love the RDX/ Tech Package.  I've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! BUT  Im getting really bad gas mileage 12.5 mpg in the city really bad at average speed of 14 mph. Other than the poor gas mileage I love everything else about the SUV.  
acura,rdx,2007,Tami, 11/08/2006,Love it!!,pos,"Just bought the RDX a few weeks ago and I love it!!  This is my first SUV I test drove others but when I drove this I was sold.   However, my gas mileage is really bad. I've been getting 12.5 mpg.  Not good. I do not drive crazy or accelerate fast so I don't know what's up but not too happy about the gas mileage."
acura,rdx,2007,BornToDrive, 11/14/2006,Finest Car in its Class,pos,"I have a 300 RX Lexus but found it a little sloppy on the road. Yes it had a luxury ride and feel but wasn't quite what I wanted. Solution RDX with tech pak. It rocks, it has performance, ride, handling and about every bell and whisltle you can find a price that will not put you in the poorhouse. Go for it!  Tech pack a must!"
acura,rdx,2007,Mi Ami, 12/08/2006,Best Car I Ever Owned,pos,"From the second you open the door to this high tech monster you know you made the right choice. It is fast, secure, comfortable, fun, safe. The sound system is beyond the finest. Navagation - wow. This one is a no brainer to own. Best car I ever owned and I had them all. This is the least expensive and the best."
acura,rdx,2007,BVaughn, 12/11/2006,First year for Acura RDX,pos,"This is my first ""suv."" My previous cars included an Acura Integra and a Mercedes CLK320. It took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride, but the handling is very similar to a car and not a truck. The sound system is excellent and the free XM radio for a couple months is nice too. The navigation system is also my first and I am thrilled with the detail in various map specs. The only real issue so far is that the battery mysteriously died at 1000 mi. Without a key in the ignition almost all electrical things shut off within 30 seconds of removal which makes it difficult to drain the battery. Overall, I am fairly happy with it so far."
acura,rdx,2007,Emile, 12/12/2006,Another Great Car from Acura,pos,"I've had the RDX for over a month, it is fun to drive.  It is very comfortable and comes with many standard otions.  I had an '04 MDX and I like this model much better. It has good fit and finish and the quality is excellent. It is very quick and the gas mileage is good.  It handles well on the open raod and is very responsive, like a sport model. "
acura,rdx,2007,wendy, 12/10/2006,Sooo Fun to Drive,pos,"I have had the RDX for two months and think it is a blast to drive.  I had an A4 1.8T and suffered through turbo lag.  There is no lag whatsoever.  This car (it's not really an SUV) really goes!  The trade-off is fuel economy.  Based on the computer, it seems like a 1/2 gallon is used each time I accelerate rapidly.  I am getting 22-23 highway and 11-13 in city. Very comfortable seats.  Audio, navigation, XM and traffic is fun but there is so much functionality it can be distracting while driving at first. Read the manual! I am disappointed in the wind noise from the driver side door at highway speeds.  Hard to detect this on test drives in urban areas.  It overshadows the stereo."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX_75, 01/07/2007,Get SUV,pos,Purchased this vehicle about one week ago and couldn't be more pleased.  The voice activated navigation and bluetooth with the technology package is awesome.  The fit and finish on this vehicle is some of the bese I have ever seen having owned Audi's and Mercedes in the past.
acura,rdx,2007,Grizzly, 01/13/2007,Great comfort,pos,"I purchased this car never having driven an Acura before, and I was sold from the minute I sat in the seat.  Comfortable, secure, and sporty.  The performance of the RDX greatly surpassed my expectation.  Far better than any of the competitors in its class.  And the technology features are easy to use and the voice recognition can do anything from find a location to turning on the A/C.  I would highly recommend the RDX to anyone wanting to purchase a small SUV with performance and technology."
acura,rdx,2007,Janice, 01/24/2007,Definite Improvement,pos,"We purchased this vehicle to replace the Honda Odyssey that I hated at 13 mpg.  I wanted the MDX but couldn't get into that one at the time - should have tried.  Anyway, this one has much better mpg, fun to drive, great looks, fairly easy entry/exit for ""fat"" mama.  Wish it had the power lift gate, auto on headlights (my Pontiac did).  And I wish I could pair my phone to it-- technology.  We love the Navi!  Wish our two Fits had that!"
acura,rdx,2007,Diego, 01/28/2007,Best car ever,pos,"Best car that I have had. And believe me, I've had every make out there. It's very fun to drive!! It's impossible to learn all the features it has. They just pop out and you think ""There's onother feature I did't know!!"" Its a great car, it's an SUV sports car."
acura,rdx,2007,SJN, 01/25/2007,Excellent SUV for the road warrior,pos,"We use the vehicle for work and travel. We love the tech package. HandsFree link is a favorite. The rear camera, SH-AWD is a must. Feels very safe to drive."
acura,rdx,2007,Mike, 02/04/2007,RDX,pos,"The most comfortable, fun car I've ever owned."
acura,rdx,2007,John, 02/06/2007,Awesome vehicle!,pos,"Our RDX is as solid as can be.  It has no problems handling grades. Matter of fact, it is tough to keep it from racing off.  The car has plenty of power, is very comfortable and has excellent ergonomic design.  It does eat up fuel, but I'll take its appetite over my old Maxima.  It truly is amazing, Acura is in a whole different class."
acura,rdx,2007,Stacie, 02/15/2007,Love It!,pos,"I purchased my RDX this week, the day before a large winter storm hit our area.  I thought the vehicle performed very well on the icy, snowy roads.  The roads are dry today, and I love the handling and feel.  The turbo engine has a lot of pep.  The interior and exterior are very sharp. I've gotten lots of compliments already from admirers who've noticed the vehicle. I also love all the things that Acura has made standard on the RDX that are options in vehicles from other automakers. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in a smaller SUV that drives more like a sportscar."
acura,rdx,2007,CJ, 02/16/2007,The Best Ever!,pos,"This is our 3rd Acura & is the best and our favorite one to date!  This car is simply awesome!  The AWD in the snow and ice is amazing.  The features and comfort of this car are excellent.  This car is luxury, drives like a sports car and has the utility of a SUV."
acura,rdx,2007,Baldegl, 02/20/2007,Mileage no hassle,pos,Averaging almost 20 mpg on first tank including urban Chicago driving and expressways. Handling very much on par with an X-3 and feels a little quicker and certainly more opulently finished interior. The 4 cylinder is surprisingly responsive. Feels faster on than the 2005 RL we traded even though comparable weights.
acura,rdx,2007,acurardx2, 03/03/2007,super,pos,"Plain super, I love the vehicle. I was contemplating between fully loaded RAV4 and BMW X3. I am glad that I test drove RDX, within minutes I was certain that I was going to buy RDX.  Turbo engine gives great accelaration, which I like better than v6 of RAV4. You get a feel of road while driving this suv which is very much like x3. RDX definitely score big points on style (interior and exterior).  I have driven this car in lots of snow and icy conditions, Acura's SH AWD and Vehicle Stability Assistant provides super handling.  I love driving this so much that I kinda want to be on road all the time."
acura,rdx,2007,Tom's RDX, 03/14/2007,Fun on wheels,pos,"Love this SUV/Car. Technology packed in the car for the price is outstanding. Stereo is best I've ever heard in a car. Incredible handling in the snow. 4000+ miles now, and each mile makes me happier I purchased the RDX. Drives like a sports car, without the cramped seats and crappy ride."
acura,rdx,2007,Jappi, 03/23/2007,Black thunder!,pos,"Honestly, I was never even considering a Japanese SUV until I took the RDX for a test spin. I love the zero to 60 in 6.8 secs, SH-AWD (it truly works!), no-lag turbo. The RDX V4 Turbo is as good as any V6 guzzler SUV you see in the market, even better in some sense. And not to mention, the tech features are just fabulous. Everything works great. The RDX handles way better than BMW X3. And come on, the luxury and reliability of Acura can never be beat. The pricing is too good as well. And the best thing, the car is going to tell me when it needs servicing. Until then, I dont even need to take it to the service guys. How cool is that?! Go Acura!"
acura,rdx,2007,Michael, 03/07/2007,Perfection,pos,"I am a young single male who works hard and plays hard. From what I have read that was the market segment Acura was hoping to target. They definitely hit the nail on the head with the RDX. This car fits my lifestyle perfectly. Whether it's a night out on the town with friends, a business luncheon, or a snowboarding trip up north, the RDX handles all of my needs flawlessly. I was concerned about how fun it would be to drive since I was coming from a sports car, but boy was I wrong. This car is such a treat to drive, it doesn't matter where you are going. It's fun, comfortable, and has great features. This is one of the first cars I have owned that doesn't have a single rattle or squeak."
acura,rdx,2007,steve v, 04/02/2007,Finally a Fun to Drive SUV,pos,"I was so hesitant to look at the RDX after I read all of the reviews about it being too bumpy of a ride with lots of wind noise. Coming from a truck based sport utility, this car screams luxury and comfort. The console is amazing and offers every amenity you can think of plus all of the gee-whiz gadgetry that appeal to the 30-something market. The stereo system is the best out there as well as the navigation package. The car handles the road like a sports car and fields the bumps just fine with minimal wind noise. If you are looking for a pillowy ride to tote your kids around this isnt it. You just need to drive it for yourself to find out if it is a fit for you and your family."
acura,rdx,2007,kenjr, 04/08/2007,Very Nice Vehicle,pos,"Drove home with the RDX w/Tech a few days ago and am absolutely loving this vehicle.  The common complaints are gas mileage and bumpy ride but those are VERY easy to overlook with all of the other great features of this vehicle.  The ride isn't THAT bumpy, but it certainly is a little rough.  Freeway driving is very nice and I'm averaging about 18-19 on my first tank of gas with a good mix of city/frwy.  My wife will probably get better MPG as she doesn't have a lead foot like I do.  Overall, great value - tech package is amazing... best on the market (and I'm a geek) without question. Build quality is solid with a lot of little cool features."
acura,rdx,2007,John K., 03/30/2007,Awesome Crossover !,pos,"This Crossover SUV is a blast to drive. I think its the best value in its class.  This was designed to compete with BMW's X3 and does so quite nicely.  Similarly equipped you would have to spend about $8,000 more if you opted for the BMW.  The Acura has a well crafted interior that is  is full of luxury.  The handling is extremely sporty, it drives a lot like a sedan with all the great features of having a SUV. I have noticed some negative reviews regarding gas mileage, feeling bumps etc...  It seems to me those people don't have common sense.  If you want a crossover with sports car like handling and performance, you will give up some gas mileage and cushyness on the road.   "
acura,rdx,2007,Lori, 04/10/2007,Great Value,pos,"I bought this car 4 months ago and love it!  Quality materials and construction inside and out.  This car feels more luxurious than many of the higher priced cars I drove and has so many more features when you add the Tech Package (totally worth the added expense, especially if you spend a lot of time on the road).  I use the Bluetooth, the voice commands, and the Navi-traffic on every trip.  Gas mileage could be better. My overall MPG (for 6000 miles) is 22.5.  Not great when I compare it to my old Honda CRV, but is still better than I expected.  To sum it up, if gas mileage is your primary concern, stick with the CRV or go to a sedan.  Otherwise, you really can't go wrong with the RDX."
acura,rdx,2007,Sutter A., 04/20/2007,"Once to get in, you will never get out!",pos,"Really, this SUV is just too cool. Buy it with the tech package. Its rival crossovers (I test drove Mazda CX7, BMW X3, Ford Fusion, GMC Arcadia) totally pale in comparison. This SUV is both performance-rich and super techy. Beware! With the sport suspension and handling, it does not drive like an old man's Cadillac. Turbo kicks in real nice. Even the base version is fully loaded - moon roof, leather, etc. For an equivalent version, other luxury brands charge you a fortune. Nobody else offers all these features in one car, and for the price. Overall, it's the best ""bang for the buck"" in its category.  Good job Acura!"
acura,rdx,2007,Albert, 05/01/2007,Acura RDX is an awesome small SUV,pos,"RDX is quick and nimble, acceleration feels like v6, it corners like it's on rails, suspension is nice & stiff, and it  has a great turning radius.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Trailman, 05/03/2007,Good Vehicle,pos,Very happy with it so far. My gas mileage has not been as bad as some others report: 17 mpg.
acura,rdx,2007,I love Acura, 04/04/2007,Acura has done it again!,pos,"I can't say enough about the new RDX! I absolutely love this vehicle!  This is my 4th Acura and they keep getting better.  Everyone interested in an SUV should put this on their list!  Once they drive it, they won't be looking anywhere else!"
acura,rdx,2007,Rob, 04/14/2007,Change is Good!,pos,"After driving a large SUV for the last four years, I am thrilled to be behind the wheel of a new RDX!  I am thoroughly enjoying the superb handling as well as all of the amenities that come standard and those that are part of the tech package.  For the extra cost, the navigation and voice command functions are easy to grasp and make the entire driving experience even more exciting.  As a father who runs many errands with my son, I am pleased with the size of the RDX as it has plenty of interior room and is comfortable for back seat adults as well.  Thus far, there is nothing about the RDX that I do not like.  Definitely a welcomed change!"
acura,rdx,2007,Greenboy, 05/03/2007,"Whew, So happy to have gotten it.",pos,"Just got the car last weekend and am having a great time.  This car is quick and responsive yet has all the versatility I need.  I go over a mountain/hill in Berkeley/Oakland every day and it is a joy to drive through the woods, taking curves and downshifting manually on the downhills.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 04/18/2007,What a blast!,pos,"I drove all the competitors prior to this purchase.  This vehicle truly screams ""fun to drive"".  I almost bought an Infiniti FX35 but could not get over the awesome tech package in the RDX at this price.  This crossover SUV almost handles as well as my BMW 330xi.  It has great acceleration.  In fact if you floor it expect to get pinned to your seat.  So far the reliability is 100% better than the Grand Cherokee that it replaced.  I cannot help myself from accelerating hard in corners and feeling this SUV handle like a sports sedan. Complaints about poor fuel economy and a  harsh ride should be put in perspective.  This is meant to be a sporty crossover and it totally meets the criteria."
acura,rdx,2007,dfjcu1979, 04/18/2007,Great SUV!,pos,"I just bought my RDX a week ago and love it thus far.  I originally thought I was going to buy an MDX but after driving both, I prefered the way the RDX handled and I do not need the extra room that the MDX has.  Mileage is ok, been getting an overall average of 19 mpg, this should improve after a couple thousand miles.  I was concerned about going to a 4 cylinder from my 06 TL.  This vehicle has plenty pickup and absolutely no turbo lag.  The engine is rather quiet too from the inside, as opposed to how noisy it is on the TSX.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Vivian, 05/14/2007,Best in its class,pos,"Test drove the BMW X3, Lexus RX 350 and the RDX is the best. It's the class leading in acceleration, braking and handling. It's just like a sport sedan and I like it better than my 2006 IS 250 (much faster....^_^). Also, the finish and materials are much better than X3 and even better than Lexus. We love the RDX and my wife is thinking to trade in her 2006 IS 250 for another RDX with tech package. It's our first Acura. I highly recommend people test drive the RDX before you make decision."
acura,rdx,2007,Kathy, 05/19/2007,Too much fun!,pos,"After six weeks of my son and I driving and researching all types of SUVs, I narrowed it down to the RDX and still enjoy every minute in it. I don't want to go to work in the morning, I want to keep going! This definitely has a sporty ride, but the handling in snow and rain is great. The controls are very easy to use, yet I am still getting use to the nav. I don't need to use it a lot, but it has been great when needed. The sound system is awesome. Still looking for some DVD-A discs of the bands I like. The size of the center console is great and I like that it locks."
acura,rdx,2007,rdx, 05/26/2007,"After 18,000 miles and 10 months",neu,"Throughout 18,000 miles of 60% city and 40% highway driving, gas mileage is 17.9 miles/gallon. Did not have any major problem other then air vent warranty fix. However, I have minor rattle and ticking noise problem. Oil change $70 x 2. Rear differential fluid $100 at 15,000 miles service. Not a comfortable ride if one is seeking an ordinary SUV ride. Some improvements on coming year (08 model) would make this car better and outstanding."
acura,rdx,2007,cnmec, 06/06/2007,My RDX,pos,"The turbo is peppy, but takes a second to kick in.  The road noise is a bit more than I would like and it is a stiff ride, which some people don't like. "
acura,rdx,2007,acurafan, 06/17/2007,Beautiful!!,pos,"Just purchased the Acura RDX with Tech Package. The moment I drove it off the lot, I knew I had made the right choice. Beautiful, smooth but powerful engine, excellent handling for an SUV and quick pickup make this a great ride. The tech package is worth it, the voice recognition rocks and you rarely need to touch any of the menu buttons so long as you know the voice commands. Plenty of room in the back seats and they fold down giving even more room. Great, sturdy car!"
acura,rdx,2007,T. Gray, 06/14/2007,2007 Acura RDX w/ Technology Package,pos,"The is my first ownership of an SUV, a term I generally despise being somewhat of a car snob. I've owned Acura sedans before, the last being a 2004 TL, so I was mildly skeptical that the RDX could provide the comfort and performance of the TL.  This vehicle redefines for me the term sport ute.  The straight line performance, particularly while using the paddle shifters, is the equal of the more powerful V6 TL once you get used to the mild turbo lag on initial throttle tip in.  And the RDX's handling actually outperforms the TL on my favorite two-lane country roads and city round-abouts.      "
acura,rdx,2007,swiftfootedperseus, 06/18/2007,Exactly Right,pos,"I really wanted something that had some get-up-and-go and was fun to drive in the mountains.  This really fills the bill.  Yes, the ride is stiff, but it's nearly as much fun to drive as my wife's Mini Cooper, which is saying a lot.  In addition, it's got one of the best sound systems I've heard. Don't worry about the road noise."
acura,rdx,2007,remke44, 08/01/2007,Very few flaws,pos,"The RDX is a great small SUV.  I've had mine almost a year and I love the ride, handling, and sleek interior.  The interior and cargo space are much larger than the exterior of the car would indicate. The biggest drawback is the poor gas mileage.  I drive 80% in the city and 20% on the highway and I've only averaged 15 MPG.  That's pretty bad for a small SUV.  Other small annoyances -- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front leg room. Cheaper than the BMW X3 and more luxurious and sportier than the RAV4 or CRV."
acura,rdx,2007,Matt, 08/07/2007,Very impressed overall..,pos,"Obviously I bought the RDX, so I must like it. I needed a smaller SUV than the MDX, but didn't want to sacrifice on features, performance, materials, and quality. Nothing else provided this mix for the money. I initially looked at the CRV, but was very disappointed in the materials and options. I was very impressed with the interior of the RDX. Excellent materials, a mind-blowing stereo, and very comfortable seats. The navigation is top notch, and some German car makers should take notes. So many techie toys too! And this thing handles like a dream. The SH-AWD from the RL is used, and whoa it's amazing. A bit of tire noise, and a bit of turbo lag are my only small gripes."
acura,rdx,2007,judy , 08/11/2007,RDX,pos,I love driving this car.  It rides smoothly and it feels luxurious.  The only thing I really hate is having to fill up the tank so often and having to pay so much because I can only use premium.
acura,rdx,2007,Carey, 09/21/2007,2007 Acura RDX: My Experience,pos,"My use of the car is limited to a 10 round trip commute to the office 5 days a week and about 150 miles of driving over the weekend.  The car drives wonderfully and has great acceleration.  Highway use is phenomenal.  Extremely comfortable back support in the driver's seat which comes in handy for my bad back.  Two gripes:  first is the poor gas mileage (18-19 city driving is disappointing (but what did I expect when I bought a car with turbo, right?)) and the CD player isn't performing well.  Still, all in all, it's very fun to drive and sharp-looking."
acura,rdx,2007,UTRDX, 10/05/2007,New To Me But So Far Impressed,pos,"I just recently purchased a preowned RDX with about 10000 miles on it.  I am really enjoying this car.  I am getting about 25 mpg on the highway and about 19 in city.  Overall this car seems very good, not at all underpowered, previous car was a sedan powered by V6 and this little SUV blows it out of the water. The interior is very confortable (no wood trim is a plus for me as I think it looks tacky).  I am hoping that the car is as reliable as other honda cars and am looking forward to updating when I get a few more miles under my belt."
acura,rdx,2007,FitnessCC, 10/06/2007,Most Fun in an SUV!,pos,"This vehicle is incredibly fun to drive.  I traded up from a TSX and the RDX actually handles/drives better!  The SH-AWD system is amazing: I feel glued to the road, no matter how hard I push the RDX.  Acceleration is great, and fuel mileage (for me) has been adequate (21 mpg) - not great, but decent for a SUV with this kind of acceleration.  The interior is wonderful - comfortable, tasteful, high-tech, full of useful information.  Awesome stereo system.  The nav system is very user friendly, if a little outdated in its database - but I absolutely love the XM live traffic display, which saves me time every day.  Great vehicle!"
acura,rdx,2007,CAS, 10/08/2007,Had questions initially,pos,"Had initial questions primarily due to problems with bluetooth, poor gas mileage and limited carrying capacity.  But now after several trips and three defective cell phones, believe I made the right choice in the RDX.  Gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg, seems to improve with each trip. City is routinely 17 mpg.  4th cell phone was the charm, bluetooth now works flawlessly.  Love the hard rear deck when using as a sedan, and sport handling is terrific.  Wife's Infiniti M35 screen graphics for navigation and rear camera is sharper and clearer, but after looking at several competitors, all have some compromises, but like RDX the best.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Lainey, 06/02/2007,Great ride,pos,"I've been looking for a car that had everything I wanted in a size I wanted.  The technology package has everything I was looking for.  There are a few things missing, but they weren't deal breakers.  The navigation is easy to use and the bluetooth is superb. The seats are comfortable and the a/c blows cold (important in the desert).  This car has good pick-up and has a great ride. "
acura,rdx,2007,Bish, 06/15/2007,An SUV with a High FTD Factor,pos,"The best thing about this vehicle is its high fun-to-drive factor. I have owned 3 VW GTIs because I loved the combination of practical, usable room and sports car handling and acceleration. I never though I could find it in a family car, much less an SUV. The ride may be a bit firm for some, but one feels noticably relaxed even after a long trip. The Tech package is worth every penny. The nav system and stereo are outstanding. The main drawback is gas mileage. I can't get much over 17 in the city and 21 on the highway. But, take a look out there, other than the RX 400h ($55K !!), this combination of FTD factor, room and tech can't be found with 20+ mpg!"
acura,rdx,2007,Lainey, 06/13/2007,Fun to Drive,pos,"I have had this CUV for about 3 weeks and driving has never been this fun!  This car has the technology I've been wanting.  I was rather surprised to find out it doesn't have automatic headlights, all my cars have had those for years.  The ride is very sporty.  As one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars I was leery of the 4cyl turbo, but it has the pep needed to get me where I want to go.  Gas mileage isn't great but I knew that going in and it's better than the car I had been driving so I'm not complaining.  There are things missing but obviously it didn't dissuade me because I bought one!"
acura,rdx,2007,Disappointed Owner, 07/15/2007,Big disappointment,neu,"I thought I could get sport and utility in one vehicle, and be happy, but I was wrong. I find myself disappointed when I want to drive aggressively. Off the line acceleration is poor. You feel like you are anxiously waiting for the vehicle to realize you want it to go. The transmission often seems to be in too high of a gear and the paddle shifters are an absolute joke. The brakes also do not inspire confidence and you can still tell that you are driving an SUV. From a utility standpoint I am disappointed with the ride, comfort of the front seats, and leg room. I can't find a comfortable driving position and actually get sore on trips longer than 20 minutes. Overall I wish I could return it."
acura,rdx,2007,Henry, 07/29/2007,A great blend of car and SUV,pos,I always get a consistent 21 mpg all around. The seats are best in class. Go ahead and try all other makes - none compare. Ride is stiff - thats the price you pay for handling. 
acura,rdx,2007,Spoiled, 08/29/2007,Hands down winner!,pos,"I drove 5 other smaller sized SUVs, the BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Nissan and Infiniti.  None could even come close to the features for the money in the RDX.  Envy of everyone at work.  So much fun to drive it makes me wish I had a longer commute to work.  Even with gas prices the way they are I find myself looking for excuses to drive somewhere.  It rains a lot here and the SH AWD is very noticibly helpful in those conditions.  This vehicle is fun, safe and a great value.  Would recommend it to anyone."
acura,rdx,2007,lrpba300, 10/01/2007,RDX is the best!,pos,"This SUV/CUV is the best all around vehicle I've ever owned! It has it all. It has a great interior, comfortable seats, great handling (like a sports car!), ride is firm, but nice, solid build, room to haul stuff, paddle shifters, great looks. I'm very happy and have had many vehicles before due to leases for work, but I bought this one and couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX Fan, 05/19/2007,Nice But Lacks Some Acura Tradition,pos,"I ordered the RDX in May and received it in Sep 06 and it was worth the wait, mostly.  Great handling and performance, sporty and comfortable around every corner & on the highway.  Acura did a good job bringing the RDX to this class of SUV.  But I do wonder why Acura went away from what worked in the MDX family (I left the MDX to come to the RDX).  With all the good there are some things missing (see Suggested Improvements).  Some toys just detract from the experience and others should have carried over from the MDX.  Maybe they should have actually asked Acura drivers what they liked before building something with so many less functional add-ons."
acura,rdx,2007,Alex M., 05/23/2007,A definite disappointment!!,neu,"I traded an '03 MDX for this vehicle because I'm single, have no need for a large SUV, and have been very happy with Acura (my 4th Honda product). This vehicle has been a big letdown compared to my MDX. The nimbleness, size and manueverabilty (and handling) are excellent, and what I was looking for, but the 4 cylinder turbo engine is terrible and is really beginning to wear down on me. There is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start, and the the engine is noisy even when accelerating moderately!! The fuel economy is simply horrendous for a small 4-banger SUV (same as my 7-passenger MDX with a 3.5L V6!!). I will likely end up trading it for something with a decent V6."
acura,rdx,2007,Luis, 06/12/2007,WOW!!!,pos,I traded in my 2004 Nissan Murano SE. I test drove the RDX with the tech package and fell in love. This SUV handles better than most sports cars. The SH-AWD is great especially in inclement weather. Gas mileage in ok but I have a lead foot.
acura,rdx,2007,jfc, 06/21/2007,Perfect mix,pos,"Acceleration, handling, comfort and utility.  Limited capacity is not a surprise based on the size.  20 mpg mixed driving - aggressive at times but not needless (like racing to a stop light).  Stiff ride took a whole week to get used to and one more to love."
acura,rdx,2007,wsdyer, 07/18/2007,I like it.,pos,"Small enough to get around the beltway nasty traffic yet, big enough to allow you to see what's up ahead.  The tech package is cool if your company allows you to synch your blackberry with your car - mine doesn't - ostensibly for security reasons.  Even if the company doesn't, it's worth it to get your own phone and just ignore theirs when it rings.  She drives like a dream and looks very stylish.  The only thing I don't like about her is really crappy gas mileage.  Even when I am on the highway I get no more than 21 or 22 MPG.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Paul, 07/20/2007,Still Needs Tweaking,pos,We liked the car at first sight. It is a blast to drive and the turbo kicks in quickly. The technology model is the way to go.  Great sound system! Overall visibility is excellent!
acura,rdx,2007,RDXer, 07/27/2007,Can't go wrong,pos,"The RDX is the complete package for the new category of CUVs. Compared to the X3 (way overpriced) and its cheaper counterpart the CX-7, the RDX is hands down the winner with better handling, vtech engine, non existent turbo lag, and Acura quality and reliability that competitors dream of."
acura,rdx,2007,Garg, 09/25/2007,Excellent SUV,pos,"I love the F1 system, drives smoothly, love the interiors, blue light is amazing. GPS is awesome. Fuel economy is bit poor but justified when you buy RDX."
acura,rdx,2007,kcosta, 10/12/2007,Love this vehicle,pos,"My husband needed a new car for work to haul people around. This vehicle is what we were looking for. It has enough luxury to impress but is still not over the top. Great performance. Although it is small, it is spacious inside. After getting used to a WRX we wanted something that did not lack in the performance department but didn't break the bank. This vehicle is perfect."
acura,rdx,2007,CD, 10/19/2007,Engine troubles are a surprise,pos,"I love everything about this car except that I have been into the shop with engine troubles about every 2-3 weeks.  The engine will suddenly rev uncontrollably and the turbo has stopped working 3 times.  This car is downright dangerous to drive without the turbo support to get you moving.  The dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is wrong yet -- just keeps erasing the codes which make the problems go away for a short while.  Sadly, it's time for a trade-in after only 5 months.  So much for Acura quality, which is one of the main reasons I traded in my Saab 9-5 for this."
acura,rdx,2007,dk168, 10/25/2007,Fun to drive but not impressed!,pos,"Have had the car for almost a year now. Not impressed by Acuras quality. Dashboard started to rattle after four months of having the car; now is getting worse, both corners rattle at cooler temperature. Even the sunroof rattles during bumpy road. Turbo lag is definitely noticeable at low RPM with A/C on.  I have to put the gear in the Sport mode to minimize the turbo lag when traffic is in a stop-and-go condition; this seems to help. Ride is a little stiff (comments given by everyone who had ridden in my car). Poor gas mileage.  I am getting averaged 18 MPG with roughly 60% hwy and 40% surface street driving.  Okay, with all the negatives mentioned, I must say the car is a fun car to drive."
acura,rdx,2007,Henry FL1, 12/01/2007,Great Ride,pos,"Other than gas mileage, it's a fun car to drive. Notice how I said ""car"" - it does not drive like a SUV at all. I considered the Honda CRV loaded, but it lacked some-like no useable armrest etc."
acura,rdx,2007,JimTex, 11/19/2007,Not for the daily commuter,pos,"We bought this car knowing that fuel mileage was not its strong point, but have averaged about 19 mpg (mostly city).  My wife loves this vehicle because it is incredibly responsive and handles as well as the BMW we traded in.  The seating position is nice and high, but without the huge vehicle to go along with it."
acura,rdx,2007,dpo, 04/24/2008,"Good car, poor storage space and MPG",pos,"The RDX performs well and is clearly well made.  It drives like a sedan.  It is a very good car for a single person, but storage space for families on trips is relatively poor, especially given only 20 mpg.  Bringing a stroller severely limits baggage space.  The reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage, you might as well buy a larger SUV.  My 4-Runner gets about 20 to 22 mpg and has far more space.   Seats are very comfortable as long as the ride is on a smooth road.  Bumps are unpleasant for back seat passengers.  Steering is tight and car handles nicely.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Zach, 08/13/2020,I must of had bad luck,neg,"I bought mine used with 100,000 so it could be that just the previous owner didn't maintain it. It was a pretty sad ending for me. At first i loved it infact i still have not found a car that has such comfortable driver seat. From the armrest on the door to the adjustability of the steering wheel it was just so well designed. The trubo flet great! It couldn't through you back in your seat but it was a gradual and nice acceleration. This crossover felt like more of a gate way to a sport car notwithstanding though it looks like a minny van. Gas mileage as expected didnt get much better than 24 mpg but for a 2007 not bad. My main complaint is that once i got a sensor it was impossible to fix. The o2 sensor went out and then everything went out spent about 2,000 to repair in one month but eventually i just had to let go"
acura,rdx,2008,Drew Engstrom, 08/07/2015,Great if you can live with the compromises,pos,"The RDX is sports sedan masquerading as a luxury SUV. Cornering and acceleration? Great. Cushioned, quiet ride? Nope. I chose the RDX because there are many SUV and truck drivers where I live and I wanted to sit a little bit higher than I would in a sedan - and I am completely sold on Honda/Acura reliability and quality. 

Quality and reliability have been excellent and the driving position is comfortable with excellent visibility; my advice to prospective buyers would be to simply understand the trade-offs:

1) The turbocharged 4 cylinder is very responsive and fun to drive - but, don't expect to get much more than 16 MPG when you're zipping around town, or about 23 MPG when cruising on the highway.

2) The taut suspension makes for great handling - but, don't expect a plush, Toyota-ish ride quality; you will feel and hear road imperfections.

3) The car is very nimble and comfortable for an SUV - but remember, this is a smaller SUV and it really isn't any roomier than a smaller sedan (think Acura TSX)

Conclusion; if you like the Acura feel (tight suspension, cornering on rails) and you want something with some power, this is as good a combination of value and quality as you can get in a small SUV.
"
acura,rdx,2008,mike, 07/17/2015,Overall We Love This Car,pos,"In the year 2015, had to replace our 2005 CRV which we loved, because of a hit and run that left our car trashed. We were looking at simply getting another CRV, but stumbled across a 2010 RDX at a dealer. We took it for a drive and fell in love. We didn't quite like the look of the 2010 model (fog lights are a little ""pronounced"" for our taste, so out of curiosity we looked and found a 2008 model with 59k miles that was a new arrival at a local dealer. Took it out for a drive, and loved it even more than the 2010 model we had driven earlier.  To be sure, we subsequently tried a few other CRVs (2005, 2010, 2012) but by that time I think we were just too smitten with the RDX and never looked back. We got the RDX for $15k and are sooooo happy about it. (cheaper than any CRVs we saw, including a 2005 model that would have essentially replaced the one we lost, but was more expensive than this 2008 RDX.  

A couple things that any buyer should be aware of especially in 2015: (1) Mileage. We just took a road trip and got 23 mpg, which is about what it was advertised at (actually slightly better).  You have to be on top of RPMs, use of AC, buying gas at Costco, and other things if you want to keep your costs and gas use down - and those are all things we are good with doing. (2) We had a little rattling in the car when we got it. After a long search we found it wasn't mechanical, but rather the latch for back seat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS7CgzsiRs&feature=youtu.be), which is now totally silent thanks to electrical tape!  That's pretty much it so far, and granted it's only been a month since we bought the car, but it is a 2008 model and no other red flags (just had it inspected too).

So many good things for us. The cabin is like a dream after the CRV. Again we loved our CRV but didn't realize how much better it could be with a car like an RDX. Driving it feels like we got bumped from coach to first class. Don't know what rear passenger  seats feel like, but front are awesome with leather, memory seats, amazing stereo, storage, Dual climate setting. Dash is real easy to look at and find what you need. We don't have the Tech model but don't seem to be complaining either. And as much as cabin rocks, the engine is amazing. 240hp turbo, whoa. So fun to drive!! That might have been the kicker for us, I'm pretty sure it sealed the deal for my wife, I'll never forget her face when she turned her first corner - she was like ""oh yeah, I love this car."" Separate from that, good fold-down seats in back to make the entire rear a flat surface, and our model is black with tinted windows, so lord it is sexy!

If you can keep on top of gas use and budgeting, I think this car is great. I realize it's early for us but coupled with our inspection by our trusted mechanic and plans to get regular maintenance checks, we hope to have many years of RDX fun to come...

Update: After a few years of owning the car, if anything I would bump up the rating. The RDX has held up extremely well, especially considering it is a 2008 model, 10 years old! We are close to 100k miles, but it's still pretty much running the same as we bought it. We have been good about service appointments based on the warnings we get from cars, and aside from normal things for older cards - like replacing brake pads - it has been solid. We have taken countless road trips which this car is really the best for, but also use it for day-to-day use and it's been great all around. Realize the age might catch up to us soon, but for now we are happy to continue enjoying the ride!
"
acura,rdx,2008,Mark, 03/26/2016,Love my RDX,pos,"The handling, acceleration and look of this car is unmatched.. Love the interior and leather seats as well. The only negative is the turbo requires hi octane and the gas mileage is a little disappointing. However, with a turbo you can't have your cake and eat it too.. Overall, I believe it's the best small SUV on the market..including the BMW..
"
acura,rdx,2008,Cone, 08/21/2017,Love it! Just can't afford it when things break.,pos,"I bought this used 6 years ago, from a known and trusted private seller. At first I loved everything except the cost of fuel. It takes Premium, and gulps it at about 19 miles/gallon on average. I love the handling, energy, road feel, visibility... it is a great ride and I love driving it. Its great safety ratings made my insurance stay the same as the previous car, which was worth 10% of what the R cost me. Here's the problem. Since 90,000 miles, stuff started to break. Notably, the A/C compressor... between $900-$1100 to replace. I had to do an inner tie rod and front struts. Most recently, the alternator. There are things gone weird with some of the technology, such as the backup sensor system and the driver memory and the map display. Recently, when the Climate Control is on Auto in hot weather, the passenger side dashboard vents have been randomly blowing HOT air instead of air conditioned cool air such as the other vents properly have. Messing around with different settings will usually help us to work around the problem. Like most intermittent problems, I suspect this will be impossible to troubleshoot and address unless it becomes constant. My guess about the technology is that 2008 was an early year in the introduction of some of this stuff. Finally, sad to say, this was my first non-Japanese-made Acura, and its fit and finish are just not as good as the two Integras I had that were actually built in Japan. I still do like this car, though, and will keep it for as long as I can.
"
acura,rdx,2008,flip110119, 01/30/2011,ACURA QUALITY,pos,"I have the 2008 RDX with Tech package - 33,000miles & it has delivered as expected. NO problems what so ever!! All that I have done so far is change the Trans fluid, rear differential fluid & Oil. I love the SUV from the performance to the comfort & utility. It's the perfect size for utility & still can parallel park in the city with no problems! I've seen a few reviewers complain about Gas Mileage but I haven't really experienced anything less than the 17/22 which Acura expects. I've been getting 19.6mpg in the city & 26.1mpg on the highway with the cruise control on at 70MPH. I keep the tire pressure at 40PSI & I drive with a roof rack. I'd buy this car again!!"
acura,rdx,2008,Medina Wood, 07/27/2016,Acura RDX,pos,"Had this car for 8 years and not once in shop.  Very reliable and stayed looking brand new after 8 years.  Very pleased with this purchase.
"
acura,rdx,2008,Stretch, 07/27/2010,The right car for me,pos,"I had an Accord, and wanted more cargo versatility. Drove several other small SUVs (Rogue, CX-7, EX-35), and the RDX was the obvious choice. The EX-35 was great, but just not enough room. The others were not comfortable enough, both in seat comfort and ride quality. The RDX does seem too stiff on city streets (my '98 Accord was smoother). But it has a solid feel, very smooth on the freeway, great acceleration, plenty of upscale features - basically a blast to drive. My wife can have her cushy Lexus. I prefer the sporty Acura."
acura,rdx,2008,ducky79, 02/14/2012,"60K, so far, so good",pos,"2008 RDX, 60K mileage, no problem so far.
I would say this is a very reliable car.
Pro: reliable, great handling, decent power
Con: rough ride, bad gas mileage
I believe it can run 3-5 more years."
acura,rdx,2008,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,It's just ok,pos,"I have been driving my RDX for 2 months now.  Interior is nice with heated leather seats, moonroof.  Not enough room in the back, my tall 9 year old won't be able to sit back there in a few years.  Gas mileage is awful.  20 mpg on average. Its a gas guzzler and you must buy premium gas. poor cargo room. My honda crv had double the cargo.  Nice pick up with the turbo acceleration.  But too much of a gas guzzler, can't wait to get rid of it.  Luxury vehicles are way over rated and not practical for the cost.  I suggest you shop around before buying a luxury car. Total waste of money just for transportation.   "
acura,rdx,2008,ledwinka, 07/17/2008,A Satisfied Owner,pos,"Worked as a vehicle test engineer for an European car company when I fell in love with the SH-AWD system on the RL. Got the RDX based in July of 2007. Handling is light and responsive for a car with this huge mass. Turning corners is a dream with the SH-AWD: it ate corners while driving down I-80 near Lake Tahoe, CA. Turbo lag is small compared to other turbo cars but you can hear them. Durability has been excellent. People all comment how pricey this car looks and become surprised at the price. Very comfortable seats. Love the relatively large width of the vehicle. Rear seat space is very large for people of two, even three. Lament that I did not get the nav system."
acura,rdx,2008,Jim R, 10/11/2008,A Great Compromise,pos,"Having spent a year and 13,000 miles with my RDX, I'm very pleased with the experience. After driving European sport sedans for the past 20 years, I wanted the utility, AWD, and taller view of a compact SUV.  However, I didn't want to give up the ""fun to drive"" nature of my previous vehicles.  The RDX delivers.  It's very quick.  And the ride is somewhat firm -- what I expected and wanted in a vehicle that enjoys attacking mountain curves.  Yet, to me the ride is by no means harsh.  The interior is well designed and fairly luxurious.  Acura reliability is a huge bonus -- I got to know the service techs far too well with my previous cars. "
acura,rdx,2008,Eilidh, 01/11/2008,Nearly as Fun as a Mini,pos,"When my cute mini cooper became a sled in the Boston winter, I reluctantly hunted for a small SUV. After much deliberation, decided on the Acura over the BMW X3 on cost and reliability. So glad I did - the sound system is superb, the build is quality, bikes fit in the back, the turbo makes pleasing whooshes and the acceleration is plenty for me. Its just as grin inducing as a mini - and no icy skidding. Negatives include instructions more mind boggling than physical chemistry textbooks and a voice recognition system that doesnt quite understand my UK English. However, I'm persevering to learn Honda-ese and confident we'll become friends. An excellent fun car in every way."
acura,rdx,2008,AcuraFan, 11/10/2007,WOW! Awesome compact SUV,pos,"I purchased this car about a month ago. What a great ride. It's Honda reliable, love the navigation system, very comfortable. This is also a VERY stylish car. No complaints, just suggestions. Good price range for a luxury crossover. From this car, I will likely drive Acuras for a long time."
acura,rdx,2008,Jeremy C, 11/25/2007,"In crossover segment, hard to beat",pos,"Faster and less expensive than the BMW X3, the Acura RDX is about as good as it gets in this segment.  It drives like a sports sedan and has plenty of storage.  If you're looking at the Murano, you should check out the RDX as well.  It's faster and a lot nicer, for only a few thousand dollars more.   The SH All Wheel Drive makes accelerating out of a corner nice as well.   Overall, I'd give it a 9.5 / 10.  "
acura,rdx,2008,twistlock, 12/17/2010,"40K and so far, so good",pos,"For the past couple of years my RDX has worked well - no warranty issues to date. In addition to city/ highway driving, I travel frequently to Lake Tahoe during the winter. The SH-AWD mated with winter tires keeps me truck'in along. Agree with other reviews that gas mileage is not the best when climbing the Sierra Nevada, but there is zero power loss (IMO) and I knew what to expect with a turbo-engine. "
acura,rdx,2008,RW, 05/07/2008,Learn about it first,pos,"Just bought my RDX and love to drive it.  Make sure you know what you are getting with the RDX - it is a sports car with stiff suspension and a firm ride so if you want a soft, ""never feel a bump"" ride then look elsewhere.  Went without the tech package - the $4k was too steep for me.  If you want the suv where sport meets luxury (and don't need that much cargo room), check it out.  "
acura,rdx,2008,MCK, 05/10/2008,"Fun, but expensive to operate",pos,"I traded my 2004 Expedition for a more efficient vehicle.  After 1400 miles of combined driving the computer indicates we averaged 14.7 MPG on expensive premium gas (required).  That is almost exactly the same mileage my big Expedition was obtaining on regular gas.  Needless to say, I am terribly disappointed.  On a positive note, the car is very comfortable (except, a lot of fun to drive, the technology package is amazing, the sound system is even more amazing.  The handling system in the car is a technological masterpiece.  But at 28.5 cents per mile for fuel (and rising), it sits peacefully in the garage while we drive our Civic and EOS around town.  "
acura,rdx,2008,angelina247, 05/13/2008,Fun RDX,pos,"I recently purchased the RDX with tech package. It is such a fun car to drive. It really has a quick pickup. I'm sometimes surprised how quickly I can take off if I'm not careful. I'm still learning how to work the voice controls and navigation screen. I really did my homework and went back and forth about whether I should lease or own. I've been leasing another make/model SUV for the past 7 years and finally decided the RDX would be worth owning. I comparison shopped the BMW X3 and Mercedes 350. The extras in the Acura for a lot less money were definitely a great incentive. Yet, I feel like the car is just as good if not better. My friends and family love it. I'm having a blast!"
acura,rdx,2008,andreadavis1, 04/14/2011,Rattle Trap,pos,"Cute, Fun car to drive. Rough ride. You can feel every bump and vibration in your head rest and seat. Isn't this supposed to be a luxury car? Stiff suspension causes things to rattle in the car. Not enough compartments. Just a big deep hole in the center console. Not large enough to fit carseats behind drivers seat."
acura,rdx,2008,Not happy in Florida, 07/11/2009,Did I just buy a lemon?,neg,"This RDX has been a nightmare. I have been in the shop 12 times since purchasing - 4 times for brakes alone. I've had them cleaned, replaced, rotors and then completely redone again. My memory module has gone, my seat has stopped working, blue tooth stopped working, bubbles on the hood from the paint, everything down to the footrest has fallen off. The rattle in the windows is terrible. Trying to get corporate to take back (WISH ME LUCK). The only good thing about this vehicle is the turbo."
acura,rdx,2008,disappoited, 02/25/2009,Brakes,neg,"I had the car for 8 months and drove wonderfully. Then, it snowed and my car had no brakes.  I would miss stop signs, traffic lights, etc.  3 wheels ago, I got in a car accidents because the brakes fail to operate. I had taken it to the dealership and complained but they indicated that some ppl have had issues but there isn't much they can do about it.  I filed a complaint at the corporate office but they brushed the matter off as if it was nothing.  Beware when purchasing the vehicle.  Not every car gets tested for snow, rain and gravel.  this is a matter of life and death, for you and others on the road with you. I am in the process of a law suit with Acura.  Good Luck to all!"
acura,rdx,2008,adam, 07/15/2008,Drive it right and get 26 MPG!,pos,"I love everything about the car. In the beginning I was disappointed in the gas mileage (~16MPG) but now that I've learned how to drive less aggressively, I'm getting 24 to 27 MPG in a mix of city/highway. The trick is to stay out of boost and under 70MPH on the highway, sure it takes patience but I've gone from 260 miles per tank to just under 400... that's a savings of about $150 per month based on the 1800 miles per month I drive."
acura,rdx,2008,lwfineny, 09/13/2007,2008 RDX,pos,"I've had the 2008 RDX for just a few days - very impressed so far. Handling and acceleration are great. I'm 6'5"" and have over 3 inches of space between my head and the roof - pretty amazing for a car with a moonroof. Initial fit and finish seem perfect. All in all, it's a lot of fun to drive."
acura,rdx,2008,Justin N., 05/12/2009,The BIGGEST MISTAKE of my life!!,neu,"Where do I start? Sure this vehicle is ""fun to drive"" and handles like a dream, and the interior is full of nifty features, like bluetooth, the Nav system and the phenomenal sound system. But that's about it!! Everything else about this vehicle is simply the worst. The turbo-4 is VERY NOISY when accelerating, and a good amount of ROAD NOISE enters the cabin. Very tiring on long highway drives!! FUEL ECONOMY is HORRENDOUS (about 15city/20hwy)- A huge disappointment for such a small 4-cylinder SUV!! (and for the most part I don't even drive very aggressively). I wish I could just return it and get something else!!"
acura,rdx,2008,RDX'er, 05/31/2008,For the Most Part -- Happy Owner,pos,"The style, speed, handling, AWD aspects are great.  The fuel economy could be better but is improving as the miles drive increases.  Dealer did have to replace the left front brake caliper due to a rattle noise but dealer assured me it was a new, factory replacement part not rebuilt.  Would be nice if it had auto on/off headlights and if the air conditioning ""auto"" function would always work with the recirculating button engaged -- living in the city you have to pretty much keep the recir button on all the time.  "
acura,rdx,2008,Satisfied Owner, 06/19/2008,Right Choice For Me,pos,"Car is wonderful to drive.  Quick and nimble, quiet yet solid.  I purchased the RDX with Tech package and am glad I did so.  Nav system is great and the ELS Stereo system is impressive.  The drive is a sporty, stiffer drive which I prefer.  I now have 3,300 miles and in mixed driving I am averaging 23 mpg."
acura,rdx,2008,dep, 08/14/2008,Amazing SUV at an amazing price point,pos,"Wow!  For the money the RDX really delivers.  I think of it as a cross between the TL Type S and the MDX.  Power is ample and the turbo makes it fun.  Grip, hold, and road feel are spot on.  The RDX makes you feel like you are attached to the pavement with no chance to ever come loose.  Acura, as they tend to do, has really invested a LOT in the technology and engineering that you will never see. From the SH-AWD to the first of its kind dual stage turbo.  So far, we are really impressed with the RDX."
acura,rdx,2008,Bob La Salle, 08/14/2008,Awesome vehicle,pos,"I have about 2,500 miles on it now and I get about 19 mpg all city driving, 26 all highway, much better than the other reviews.  It helps fuel economy if you keep that turbo gauge needle pointing down at the bottom, but the power is there when you need it.  It is really fun to drive and just the right size; awesome stereo & interior electronics; sporty to drive & sporty/plush ride."
acura,rdx,2008,ray f, 08/26/2008,Puts a smile on my face when I drive,pos,"Just bought an RDX Tech package.  This is primarily a commuter vehicle and a second car, so I was debating about getting a sedan for the gas mileage.  I really like SUVs though, and this one is spot on the money -- fun to drive, higher ride height, good performance, decent space.  I had a BMW x3 and 3 series sedan, and I like this better than either of those cars.  Each time I drive it, I get a smile on my face (hearing the turbo whoosh is a blast).  I just wish it got a bit better mileage.  Previous cars also include an MDX (previous body style).  This is way better than that car in tightness, comfort, luxury, and technology."
acura,rdx,2008,pdxRDX, 12/04/2008,A wolf in sheep's clothing.,pos,"What a hoot this thing is to drive! Somehow the wizards at Acura have managed to put the soul of a sports car into an SUV.  Decent fuel economy (great for an SUV), comfortable interior, great looks, amazing acceleration, plenty of goodies in the base model.  Buy one NOW!"
acura,rdx,2008,Marty, 12/05/2008,Nice,pos,"I've had the RDX for about three months and have been very pleased.  I drove a Honda Pilot for 5 years and it did a great job of hauling kids, but driving it was kind of like driving a boat.  Not so with the RDX.  This little SUV handles better than my wife's TL but offers a lot more flexibility.  I'm getting about 20 mpg in mixed driving, which is about what I expected.  I could probably get better mileage if I kept the little red turbo needle pointing down more often, but where's the fun in that!  So far, a really nice car."
acura,rdx,2008,Danny B., 03/10/2009,Great SUV!,pos,"A great little SUV!  It outperforms my G35X in the harshest winter conditions and is more fun to drive.  My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it had a little more cargo space; but then I guess it would have been the MDX.  The interior is beautiful, the features and tech outstanding.  And I LOVE the XM Satellite radio!  A great car!  My wife loves it and I love driving it when she's not."
acura,rdx,2008,JJayB, 03/20/2009,"RDX after 27,000 miles",pos,"I test drove every car in its class before I decided to buy the RDX.  I wanted something smaller than the gas guzzling Cayenne Turbo I was driving.  I wanted good visibility, good handling and reasonable fuel mileage and a vehicle I can put my golf clubs without folding down the back seats, which the Porsche, Audi, MB Ml all fail. The RDX has good acceleration and if you use the paddle shifter it beats just about any Suv at the stop light grand prix.   The handling leaves the X3 for dead.  Only negatives is the brakes.  Several high speed stops in succession will cause the pads to vibrate.  Dealer has replaced rotors and pads for free and admits it a problem.  Also, nav screen is not bright"
acura,rdx,2008,ALB, 04/01/2009,*Insert Smiley Face Here*,pos,"This car just makes me smile every time I get in it.  Roomy interior, comfortable seating, out-handles any small SUV I've ever driven.  If there were one car to completely embody my persona, this would be it-- spunky, sporty, with the perfect mix of practicality and luxury. "
acura,rdx,2008,Kdog, 04/13/2009,Qualtiy not good for price,neu,"I actually like this car, it handles well and has a lot of nice features. I have 23 months to go on my lease and will not purchase again. Too many rattles for a car at this price range. The gas mileage is horrible especially in the city, 17 mpg. I have taken it in twice and they seemed to fix one rattle but the other is still VERY audible. Overall somewhat disappointed. "
acura,rdx,2008,Mike H, 06/03/2009,"A good car from Acura, if it's for you",pos,"Buy this car with your eyes wide open and your expectations in line - you'll be happy. Reading the previous reviews for the RDX, I wonder whether some simply chose the wrong car. Don't buy a race horse, and then complain that it eats too much or can't pull a loaded wagon. This turbocharged engine has its quirks, but drive it right and you'll be rewarded with decent mileage and good acceleration. About 21-22 if driven moderately. Is it noisy?  A slight growl when floored. How about road noise? Depends on the road. Texas chip-and-seal roads get a little tiresome, but interstates are pretty quiet, and low-to-moderate speed roads are no problem. For me it's the right car - I'm happy."
acura,rdx,2008,sfduckie, 01/03/2008,I love this car!!,pos,"I've never owned an Acura before but I'm now a huge fan! The RDX is fun to drive, has great visibility, and the base model comes with absolutely everything you'd want (CD, bluetooth, MP3 hookup, XM radio free for 3 months, moonroof, seat warmers, etc). Also, the driver interface (at least on the base model) is intuitive and uncluttered. It feels like they really have the driver in mind. I highly recommend this car!  I'm so happy I bought it!"
acura,rdx,2008,Brenda Rodrigues, 01/09/2008,Awesome vehicle!!!,pos,"This is a great SUV! I received this SUV after totaling my 2002 dodge neon.  I was telling my husband how much I loved the MDX but not just any MDX. It had to be the older model because I was no fan of the rounded backs.  After a wise car salesman convinced me that I could get a 2008 RDX for the price of a used MDX with nearly 30-50 thousand miles it was no surprised I rushed to take the RDX for a test drive.  After the test drive I was sold.  We visited that dealership more than my in laws literally.  After a few weeks of debating, on 12/15/07 my husband purchased me the 2008 tech RDX.  I have put well over a thousand miles on it and I have had it less than a month.  It is a joy to drive!"
acura,rdx,2008,RDXLover, 01/19/2008,Love My RDX,pos,"Love my new RDX.  It's fun to drive and has all the bells and whistles that I was looking for.  Tech Package is a must especially if you like gadgets.  Handsfree bluetooth works great.  Very easy to to use and program.  Nav system is also very easy to use, easy to use voice commands.  Much better than my Camry bluetooth and nav"
acura,rdx,2008,Erik B., 11/28/2010,All Around Well Built,pos,"This is the first car in the luxury category that I considered buying. I own all Honda products. Pros: comfortable drivers seat, thrill to drive, rock solid reliability, Maintenance Minder system, sports car handling Cons: cheap aluminum accents, turbo lag, slightly cramped back seat, navigation should be touchscreen (selector knob is cumbersome, stock tires wear quickly Overall, I do like this car. It was a dealership loaner with 17,000 miles on it. It lacks the refinement of the other cars in this class (BMW X3, LandRover LR3, etc.) but for the price you get all the options you could ever need. I will most likely opt for another Acura when purchasing my next vehicle. "
acura,rdx,2008,Marc, 02/05/2008,So much fun,pos,"Just picked up the RDX 2 weeks ago and love it so far. My fiancée wanted an SUV, I wanted a sports car and we settled on the RDX. It has the body and space of an SUV, the interior of a luxury sedan, and drives like a sports car. I spent months looking at similar rides such as the BMW X3, Infiniti EX, Honda CRV, Rav 4 and this car had the most to offer in terms of features and was priced right in the middle of the pack. I couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2008,Drwarf, 02/12/2008,It's a Thrill Ride!,pos,"I finally own my dream vehicle. This RDX is beautiful. I picked the carbon bronze because not too many vehicles on the road are that color. The AWD is superb for handling in any situation. The turbocharged engine is very good for performance in passing and acceleration, better than some V6s. The interior is very comfortable with the adjustable driver seat and roomy enough second row. The satellite radio, 360-watt stereo system, dual climate, digital read-outs, and memory seats are all awesome for standard equipment. The fuel economy is respectable and premium gas is not a problem. This crossover is a 10 all the way around. Thanks Acura for another innovative, top-of-the-line vehicle."
acura,rdx,2008,Acura Owner, 02/12/2008,The All-Everything SUV,pos,"This SUV has it all.  All-wheel drive and a turbo and all the technology features you need (including a free 3-months subscription to XM-Radio and a back-up camera) in a true luxury package.  This car re-defines obsessive-compulsive traits up towards the maximum in terms of vehicle mechanical design and attention to interior fit and finish. On the road the vehicle is quiet, powerful and handles like a sports car on tight turns. The turbo has no noticeable lag and makes highway merging a breeze.  Once at cruising speed, the electronics enable you to easily check on all important vehicle functions without taking you hands off the steering wheel or your eyes off the road. "
acura,rdx,2008,Steve , 02/16/2008,RDX is a rocket!,pos,Love my RDX.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Last two cars have been BMWs 3 & 5 Series and will never go back.  Acura gives a great car for the money and very solid.  Much more reliable than the BMW and performs better.  Gas mileage isn't that bad (about 19) considering it's a 4000 lb car and it flies!
acura,rdx,2008,Dave Willson, 02/20/2008,2008 Acura RDX,pos,"What a great car.  Can't beat the bang for the buck.  The tech package is amazing, the acceleration is great and the car is useful and fun to drive.  The only two negatives are the gas mileage (I only get about 20 mpg) and the fact that the front passenger seat isn't power.  Otherwise, I can't complain about one thing!"
acura,rdx,2008,bballfreak150, 02/21/2008,"So happy, best decision I have ever made",pos,"Went from a 2001 Lexus IS 300 to a 2008 RDX.  Couldn't be happier, all of the things I loved about my IS with the room and comfort of an SUV.  It is actually faster than my old car and gets better gas mileage too. I'm averaging just over 22 mpg.  I love the AWD, turbo is amazing, and it's just really fun to drive.  If you are looking for a vehicle that is fast and fun to drive, gest good gas mileage, and have enough room to carry all of your gear then this is the perfect vehicle for you.  It was the best decision I have ever made."
acura,rdx,2008,Josh B, 03/01/2008,"Fun, fun, fun!",pos,"I've had my RDX one month now, and I absolutely love it! It really moves and sounds wonderful doing it. The interior is very inviting in taupe with better than expected room for four adults. The heated leather seats offer comfort and support in the turns, which is a good thing, because this machine loves the curves. Best car I've owned!"
acura,rdx,2008,neumogirl, 09/25/2007,Love this car!,pos,"Have had this car for about two weeks and love it.  Test drove all the CUVs from upscale/luxury to affordable/no frills; from ML350 and X3 to the Ford Edge and Mazda CX7, even drove a Hyundai Santa Fe.  None compared to the RDX for the money and the features.  It's so much fun to drive and is extremely comfortable.  Came from Infiniti M45 so I know comfort and this RDX is just as cushy.  Look forward to showing it off to my friends.  It was a long process to decide but I'm sure glad I took my time and chose the RDX.  It was the best choice for my money!  I ordered chrome wheels and now it's looking so pretty!"
acura,rdx,2008,rob, 09/19/2007,Great Car,pos,"Wife loves the car.  Easy to park, drive, and back camera is great. "
acura,rdx,2008,Great Car!, 10/10/2007,Great Car!,pos,"After purchasing this car almost two months ago, I decided I had to write a review considering I have found the reviews out on Edmunds to be very helpful.  I purchased the RDX after my 2002 VW Jetta broke down which happened frequently.  The Acura is a wonderful car in general, and the RDX is great!  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  It is easy to drive, easy to park, has great acceleration when needed.  It is super comfortable and just big enough that I feel like trucks can see me better on the highway.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for solid reliability and easy maintenance."
acura,rdx,2008,dan, 09/24/2007,Technology Package,pos,"If you get bored easily, opt for the technology package.  Not only will this car talk to you but it will let you know exactly whats going on performance-wise down to each wheel.  The rumors of turbo lag are true from stand-still acceleration.  However, when the turbo kicks in, it's like no feeling a V6 can offer.  You feel like you are being lifted off your seat then pushed back into it.  My wife has a Murano.  This car is much smoother, ride, acceleration, braking and even the seats are softer.  If you want the performance that may outrun a BMW 3 series but need room for the family pet, this is the vehicle!"
acura,rdx,2008,benlee78, 10/17/2007,2008 RDX Base,pos,"Since my wife had a baby, I have traded my 06 Acura TL (base) for the 08 RDX base model. Even though I miss my TL, I thought this was a good trade.  Pros: This is a fun and powerful vehicle. The turbo gives it an extra kick in acceleration. AWD gives the vehicle more stability. Interior and the exterior design is pretty decent. Stereo sounds is great. Price value is pretty good for a luxury/sport vehicle. "
acura,rdx,2008,RDXTech, 11/11/2007,Fun car,pos,"Bought this last month replacing the RX 300 we had and the features are so much better. Very comparable luggage space to the RX 300. Just had a kid and the big Chicco stroller fits in easily along with bags from weekend grocery. Have never towed, so no complains about the 1500 lbs capacity there. Still need to try the paddle shifters."
acura,rdx,2008,CHdriver, 03/11/2008,Try It; You'll Love It!,pos,"The RDX was the last car we looked at before we were going to commit to an BMW X3. Are we glad we looked! Absolutely great price and deal, and so much car. Saved at least $7,000 of the X3 and we still got everything we wanted. "
acura,rdx,2008,Ellen Mansour, 12/06/2007,Repeat Acura customer for a reason,pos,"Can't beat Acura for reliability, safety and stability on the road.  The technology package is easy to use, the sound system is impressive and it drives like a dream.  I couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2008,Scorpion18, 03/25/2008,Awesome Sporty Machine,pos,"I drove a Camry V6 for 3 years and was just enough happy with it but wanted a sporty drive, tried X3, BMW 3 series, Lexus IS 350, CX-7 and a few more before finalizing on this one and I am glad I went to see it. It is a awesome combo or class, features, acceleration and I love the ELS system with 10 speakers making it better sounding than any other vehicle I tried."
acura,rdx,2008,VB, 12/10/2007,Wow!,pos,"Never did a review before, but had to comment on my new ride.  Overall this car is terrific.  I find a new feature I love every day.  I am on my 5th tank of gas and am getting 21.8 mpg.  Traded an '03 Aviator that never got better than 16, so I'm thrilled.  Looks good, feels good, drives good.  Never owned a 4 cyl. before.  Can't believe the pick up.  Plenty of power when you need it.  Love it! Love it!"
acura,rdx,2008,DWB, 04/13/2008,Wonderful driving experience,pos,"I purchased the RDX 2 weeks ago with 7 miles on it. It now has nearly 1000 miles with combined city and highway miles. The day after I picked it up I drove 550 miles and averaged 23 MPG. 90% of the time it was downpouring rain in the mountains of WV and VA. I've been averaging 18 MPG around town however I do not sit in traffic very much. I had a Civic and it was a great mode of transportation. However, the RDX is a driving experience with immense pleasure from the XM radio and sound system to the handling and comfort. Also got the protection package, wheel locks and tow package."
acura,rdx,2008,Otto, 04/30/2008,Love This Vehicle,pos,Traded in my 2003 Highlander for an RDX on 4/18/08 and wish I had done it sooner.  I put over 800 miles on during the first week and I couldn't be happier.  The turbo is awesome and the technology package is great.  Mileage is slightly better than the 17/22 on the sticker.  I was looking to downsize a bit and just couldn't bring myself to purchase a sedan.  What a great choice.  This baby drives like a sports car and still gives me some options on the utility side of things.
acura,rdx,2008,Nancy, 05/07/2008,If Only Gas Was Free!,pos,"I absolutely love this car.  It is sporty, fast, handles well, comfortable, super fun to drive.  Unfortunately, I live in a busy city and this is not the car for city driving.  Gas mileage is awful.  I average 16 miles/gallon city driving.  Haven't taken it on the open road yet.  This car is perfect for less populated areas."
acura,rdx,2008,3rdAcura, 05/30/2008,Fun to Drive,pos,"I leased this vehicle back in November 07 after trading in my TL, and have been very pleased overall. There is a slight clinking sound from somewhere under the dash that randomly comes and goes and the dealer cannot identify it. Aside from this which does not affect performance, the ride is both quick and sporty. Pick up is incredible with the turbo engine. I find that the cargo space is adequate for our needs and we can fit our child's stroller in the back easily. I can also get golf clubs in back without having to angle them. It is a fast sporty sedan in a mini SUV body. We proceeded to get rid of our Jeep Hemi Engine and lease an MDX as well putting us into our third Acura."
acura,rdx,2008,Cindy, 05/30/2008,Better than BMW X3,pos,"Before purchasing the RDX, I drove a 2005 BMW X3 for three years.  I loved my X3, but the newer models are quite expensive.  I'm just delighted with the RDX.  It has a similar drive to the X3 and the savings over the X3 is huge.  Was treated very well by the dealer and I've had for a week and absolutely adore this vehicle. It is designed very well and the interior of the car is actually nicer than the X3, in my opinion.  The seating is every bit as good as the X3.   I'm looking forward to my first long road trip in my new RDX.  It corners like a BMW and has a sports car type feeling when you drive it.  It is a nice package!"
acura,rdx,2008,pathfinder11, 04/01/2020,cheap interior,neg,"don't buy one, leather and pleather is so inferior I don't really know what to compare it to, door inserts, armrests, center console top all had to be replaced, seat stitching pulling out.  Terrible gas mileage but engine seems to be ok otherwise"
acura,rdx,2008,elizabethok, 08/01/2013,"ACURA RDX NAVIGATION, SPEEDOMETER, ODOMETER, TRIP OVERSTATED MILEAGE",neu,"This car has an overstated mileage problem approximately every 10 miles adds 5 miles in turn uses the gas. Acura dealer service depts. will not acknowledge the problem, test or accept responsibility. In my own car I have been lied to. I log near every mile I drive to check the discrepancy. This car has been refused to be serviced by dealer service depts. Client relations does nothing for me except log and ask to accept apology. "
acura,rdx,2008,Quiltdiva, 02/24/2008,I love it,pos,"I have been looking at the 2009 Nissan Murano, Mazda CX-7 & 9, Subaru Tribeca and 2008 Nissan Rogue.  The RDX is just right for me. All those wonderful luxury features plus not so huge.  It drives really stiff, more like a sports car and the seats are wonderful. I made the right decision for me."
acura,rdx,2008,CHdriver, 03/06/2008,A Lot of Car & Fun,pos,Have owned the car for almost 3 weeks. Wife & I been looking at BMW X3 & Highlander (go figure). Looked at the RDX as a lark! Both of us immediately fell in love with it. It offered so much for the price. 
acura,rdx,2008,aust_lr, 08/28/2008,2008 Acura RDX,pos,"The RDX is a great small SUV. It is fun to drive, handles well, and looks great. It is a little pricey for a car that competes with the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV 4 but it is better than them in performance and build quality."
acura,rdx,2008,Christopher Cromer, 11/16/2016,Outstanding!,pos,"Best purchase ever, love it!
"
acura,rdx,2008,khanna111, 04/11/2009,Almost a year - BP up and down,neu,"It has almost been a year since I bought the RDX. I was impressed by the kick from the turbo and the Acura reputation in *quality* etc. It all started with the rattles, squeaks and then somehow the turbo lost its zing. Got the rattle on the tail gate fixed. The dealer said that he has seen this with other RDXs as well. The driver's door has an intermittent issue with some sort of flapping sound and an even more infrequent window glass rattle. The dashboard in front of the steering has an infrequent noise coming in. It gets more regular and easier to hear when the sun is out and at low speeds. The zing from the turbo and the acceleration is missing out recently - should have gone for infinity"
acura,rdx,2008,Tom, 02/24/2008,Waste of money,neg,"Definitely not worth 33,000 dollars. No leg room for back seats. No auto turn on/off of headlights. Rough riding. Opening the driver door after a drive will not open the back door. You have to use either the remote or the door button to open the back doors. Bad fuel economy. Wish there was atleast a beep sound when you back up to walls or curb (expect that for cars over 30000). Tom"
acura,rdx,2008,af145, 07/23/2008,Great so far!,pos,"We've had this car for 2 weeks, and both my wife and I love it so far.  Turbo works great, giving you the extra boost when needed and staying ""asleep"" while you are just cruising along the highway.  The RDX handles much better than the 2002 Honda Accord V6 we used to drive.  The car is truly loaded with features.  To pick a few: the navigation system knows your speed and gives you correct instructions even while the satellites are obstructed; the HUGE center storage keeps the glove box free of regular clutter (radar detector, Garmin nav) and has enough space for my wife's purse; voice recognition correctly understands our accented English; homelink replaces the ugly garage door remote."
acura,rdx,2008,Lazo, 04/22/2010,Nice Car,pos,You will not enjoy this car unless you really have patience and read the guide. I purchased this car for my wife and we are happy with it. This is a strong stable car you can rely on. Many features you will discover as you read the guide. Thanks to Reviews in this site I took the decision to buy this car.
acura,rdx,2008,richman3, 12/31/2010,"it's true.. good but could be better, easily",pos,"It is true, all that was written by the reviewers on edmunds... The glove box slams on the passengers legs, the cup holders are not adjustable, the lights are not automatic, the GPS cannot be seen when sunny, center console oepns to side instead of up, your have to hit the OK button every single time on the GPS unit, I mean every time you get in the car. This is silly, and could also be easily recitified. Just download a patch.
etc. etc.
All of these could easily be fixed. Come on Acura this will take just a little effort. That being said I love the pickup and handling and it has plenty of utility for me. Just throw my hockey stuff in and go. e on Acura, this is a luxury brand. "
acura,rdx,2008,ScottyB, 11/10/2007,So far so good....,neu,"I leased this car last month, and am generally pleased so far. It drives well with nice power and handling, although the ride is a little bumpy, if you are used to a luxury or performance sedan."
acura,rdx,2008,Dan, 11/05/2007,The 2008 RDX beats all the competition,pos,"I love my RDX. I've had this vehicle for almost a month now and I'm very impressed with everything about this SUV. I spent a lot of time researching and comparing different vehicles but once I started test driving them, the Acura RDX with the Tech package really beats all the competition. It's the best luxury for my money. Stereo sound is amazing. Interior and exterior finishing fantastic. Its fun to drive because of the smooth and powerful handling. I'm really happy with my purchase."
acura,rdx,2008,Alex, 11/08/2007,The perfect SUV for us,pos,"Handling and acceleration are far better than the other SUVs we test drove - Lexus RX 350, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander.  Feature for feature, none of the other SUVs we considered could beat the RDX's value.  Good thing too, because none of them were nearly as fun.  This is an SUV that will provide us plenty of utility, allow us to grow in it, yet small enough for the city, and will continue to be fun so that we won't mind keeping it for a while."
acura,rdx,2008,Sean, 11/19/2007,My Mom loves it!,pos,"Gave this car to my Mom for her birthday.  Replaced a benz E-320 with just 8k miles, but she likes the Acura even more."
acura,rdx,2008,nomorecivicsi02, 12/01/2007,Perfect size. Great fun.,pos,"I needed a vehicle to replace my 2002 civic Si.  The first time I drove the RDX I knew I wanted one. This thing is as much fun to drive as my Si. If you're looking for a small, quick, great handling SUV with some luxury, this is the vehicle for you. "
acura,rdx,2008,JohnnyV, 03/31/2008,"So far, the best car I ever owned",pos,"I traded in a 2005 Subaru WRX STi which I bought new after months of research. It was terrible.  I've had the RDX a month and it's an extraordinary vehicle. For someone w/ low back problems the driver's seat/position is perfect, unlike the poor seat in the Toyota RAV 4.  I'll check back in a few months."
acura,rdx,2008,czechmate, 12/11/2007,Nice car to have,pos,"I only have a few hundred miles on it. It is well made with nice internals and a few bugs. Complicated not-so-friendly navigation system. One must learn the exact commands (over 100 of them) to handle it safely and efficiently while driving. There is information missing on streets that have been in existence for many (7) years. If that is to be programmed one needs to look up MAP-IT beforehand and find the major intersection.. The engine require synthetic MOBIL-1 oil, and a higher octane gasoline. Trunk is large enough but be prepared to purchase the cargo net. "
acura,rdx,2008,Ravi, 05/27/2008,Powerful RDX... like a bomb,pos,Purchased base RDX 3 months ago. Its value for money and it delivers as promised. Like its initial pickup. You will be ahead of traffic!! Like its estimated MPG feature and shows how fuel efficient you can drive. I am getting around 16 miles in city. 
acura,rdx,2008,chicagordx, 06/25/2008,Highly Recommended,pos,"Checked out the Nissan Murano and BMW X3...Saved about $5k in regards to the Murano and $10k in regards to the X3 by opting for the RDX. This car is worth every cent...luxury, yet it feels like driving a sports car. Navigation/AcuraLink is fabulous and the best one out there. Definitely check it out before saying ""I'll just buy a Garmin"". Its worth the upgrade in price. Only negative is the gas mileage, I have 500 miles on the car and average about 14.4 mpg. The good thing is that my commute is only 2 miles each way to work so its not too bad. If you're in the market for something in this market, definitely be sure to check the RDX out..its so much fun to own. "
acura,rdx,2008,Tyler, 03/29/2008,Very happy with purchase,pos,"It has great acceleration and hugs the road very well.  The suspension is stiff and reminds me of my old RSX-S (could be good or bad depending on the driver).  I've driven from TX to CA in this and was not fatigued.  All in all, it is a pleasure to drive.  I do extensive research whenever I buy pretty much anything and I found this to be a better buy than the competitors."
acura,rdx,2009,Nick, 03/20/2010,Know what you're buying,pos,"We wanted a AWD vehicle to travel in winter to Northern NV and Sierra Nevada mtns. We wanted a small SUV.  We loved the CR-V but it was a Dog (4 Cyl.) and the Rav4 was stylish 10 years ago, so we checked out the RDX.  It has impressive quickness & handling and it's really fun to drive.  What we didn't expect is the gas mileage.  We have only gotten 17 mpg in town once and highway isn't much over 20.  On long trips be prepared to gas up frequently (and always with premium). Overall I really like the SUV and the fact that the turbo doesn't lose power with elevation.  Know what your buying -an AWD SUV w/ a turbo- and accept that you won't get great mileage."
acura,rdx,2009,accurashopper, 07/09/2009,"A fun, fun, fun sporty little SUV",pos,"I absolutely adore this SUV! I drove a mid-size sedan for many years and it did take some time to adjust to the RDX. The tilt down mirror on the passenger side is wonderful when backing.  The interior is well laid out with all of the controls within easy reach.  The center console is deep - it holds my large purse with room to spare. The front seats are comfortable and there's ample knee space in the rear with the front seats all the way back.   Ride is firm - you feel some of the bumps and hear a little road noise, but the fun factor outweighs any of this.   Fits my small family perfectly. Represented an excellent value for the money compared w/competition.  Currently get 19 mpg city."
acura,rdx,2009,ronispeech, 07/05/2011,compares to other luxury vehicles,pos,"We have driven Lexus, BMW, Jeep and Infinity SUV'S and have been most impressed with our Acura RDX!!
This SUV handles beautifully and we have only required scheduled maintenance for oil changes.
We plan on purchasing/leasing a second RDX this spring."
acura,rdx,2009,jmh12, 12/28/2011,Comparing the RDX to BMW X3,pos,"I traded my X3 for a used RDX. While the X3 was a good car, it's reliability was waning after 100K. The RDX was a great choice. Reminds me of the X3. Ride is about the same (choppy over rough spots) but handles even better than the X3. Seems roomier and gets a bit better gas mileage. Sure you can get low miles if you keep your foot in the turbo. I'm getting 23 to 27 on the highway and 19 in town. This is the AWD version too. I have an MDX that's been a reliable car. I expect the RDX to follow suit. It's a great car for one who enjoys driving and isn't put off by the tight suspension. Plus it's an Acura."
acura,rdx,2009,Lindsey, 03/29/2010,Love this car,pos,"I'm really enjoying this SUV! I really love the size and room it has on the inside! The only problems that I've had are the speakers, I blew three of them! And I have no idea how! This car is fun to drive and everyone that rides in this car loves it! I looked at many SUV's before purchasing this one! This one was by far the best! Perfect size and not a lot of people have this car! SO you wont have the same car as everyone else!"
acura,rdx,2009,Jim, 05/07/2016,Bumpy ride,pos,"Gas mileage for 4 cylinder is poor and vehicle uses premium fuel. Ride is quite uncomfortable.
"
acura,rdx,2009,JEM, 11/12/2008,A winner for Acura,pos,"Having leased 2 MDXs over the past six years, I had no reason to look outside the Acura line to lease a new vehicle. I did, however want to economize on lease payments and no longer needed the additional space and seating of the MDX.  The RDX really fills the bill.  Super handling, great performance and real comfort for the driver and front seat passenger.  The traditional Acura safety features and interior appointments are apparent.  The voice activated tech package is awesome tho requires familiarity.  This is just a feel good vehicle to drive."
acura,rdx,2009,LC, 11/25/2008,"Fun, great mid-size SUV",pos,Let me say that I love Acuras because of the value you get with the car.  No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price.  All the toys work and make this a great car to drive.  It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG. It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get. This is not a luxury sedan.  What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven. 
acura,rdx,2009,erik Jensen, 12/03/2008,Best performance in class!,pos,"Just purchased - compared to BMW x3 and Mazda C7.  I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette, my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency.  Looked at Subaru WRX, WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family.  The Acura is loaded with options, well built (solid), comfortable enough.  Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive.  I am surprised they don't market this differently.  Turbo 4 banger, SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber - snow is good!  I can also fit kids, wife, dog, etc.  Very happy with performance, technology is overdone - voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level"
acura,rdx,2009,Amyjo, 12/21/2008,Fun and sporty,pos,"I have only had this car for a few days, but I LOVE it! I have always loved Hondas and I have wanted AWD drive for years, so this is the perfect mix of fun and safety. The turbo and handling are impressive. It's like a sport sedan with higher clearance, AWD, and more trunk space."
acura,rdx,2009,Leonid, 04/23/2009,Great Car,pos,I have been driving this car for about a month and I have really enjoyed every moment in it while at the wheel. It accelerates and runs great. The turbo engine is amazing. My wife and I like the RDX exterior and interior. The ergonomics is virtually perfect. I think the RDX is one of the best buys on the SUV market.
acura,rdx,2009,tom, 05/05/2009,Long term review,pos,"Have owned the SUV for one year and 18k miles now. Fun to drive, good visibility, excellent handling and did real well in the New England winter. I am not a very aggressive driver and don't use the paddle shifters much.  I do a mix of highway and city driving. I am averaging 21 mpg.  The rear suspension is very firm which could be uncomfortable for rear adult passengers on longer trips. I owned another Acura five years ago.  I was disappointed with the fit and finish of my SUV.  Total of three trim pieces on the dashboard and passengers door panels were replaced under warranty because they became loose.  Had to also take it back for rattling sound behind the glove box ."
acura,rdx,2009,Tim, 02/07/2016,Sports car in SUV shell,pos,"The sportiest of a batch of SUVs available that year: BMW X3, Volvo XC60, and Audi Q5. Excellent mechanical reliability, although a couple electronics issues with the side-view mirror.
"
acura,rdx,2009,itzsyk, 12/17/2011,What a snatch!,pos,"It's been 2 great years since I first picked this baby up. The biggest reason for choosing this car, is because the 2.3 liter engine from Honda is only used in the RDX. The small turbo is also very peppy. There's virtually no lag - VTec kicks just under 4k rpm. Unfortunately, the drop in peak power is very noticeable. The ride is stiff, but supple. Just enough to feel confident without suffering back pains. I put regular gas for 1k miles recently, and to my surprise, there was no loss in power. But, there was loss in the stiffness of the steering wheel. Regardless, I advise premium gas. The brakes were the biggest disappointment. They feel like they stop 60-0 in 130-140 ft. "
acura,rdx,2009,jbriscoe, 07/01/2012,Like an MDX and Accord all in one,pos,"I owned a 03 MDX and 07 Accord V6 previously...I wanted to go back to a SUV...just not a large one. The RDX fit the bill for me. I get 22 mpg non highway driving at an avg speed of 28 mph, I drive 66 mi daily round trip to work. The turbo kicks in when needed and the ride inside the cabin is quiet. The road feel can be bumpy on poorly maintained streets and the handling is great on quick turns.
If you need more cargo room and a fold down third seat, opt for the MDX and a few less mpg. I'm 5'3 and my husband is 6'1 and we both have plenty of head and leg room."
acura,rdx,2009,Fred, 07/08/2009,Beware,neu,"This is not the luxury car that Acura should be selling.  Unlike other Acuras, the vehicle does not have automatic headlights, a basic safety and convenience feature available on similar, and many far less expensive cars.  The gas mileage is far less than advertised.  It is very difficult to open the rear door.  The instrument panel, particularly the radio controls, are poorly designed and difficult to use.  While the turbo engine is very good and the ride is decent, the car is not what I have come to expect from Acura -- they should be ashamed."
acura,rdx,2009,Frank G CPA, 08/23/2008,RDX Worst Horrible Ride ever,neg,"First the RDX is NOT a luxury auto by any standards.  The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint.  On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle.  I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else.  I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX.  Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response ""well it is based on a truck"" so I don't expect future models to address the ride."
acura,rdx,2009,AJJ, 10/26/2008,Buyer's Remorse,neu,"I drove the RDX 2x before deciding to buy and I sincerely regret it. There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying. The gas mileage has not improved with time, only getting 13 mpg. The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash. The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine. The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid. Other Acura models have this feature, except RDX. For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW. Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options, but they make a great driving machine. Acura, in my book, has a long way to go. "
acura,rdx,2009,RZeman, 01/05/2009,Some Remorse,pos,"This is my fourth Acura.  The last being an MDX.  While I realize this is an ""entry level"" SUV the quality and luxury of Acura has been scaled down on this vehicle.  When my Lexus RX350 lease ended I didn't want to get the same car twice and the MDX has gotten to big with no more kids or large dog to haul around.  There some features left off of this Acura which should be standard issue i.e. automatic headlights and power rear door, rain sensing wipers.  The gas mileage is ridiculous.  We celebrate when I can hold the average at 19 mpg for more than 10 minutes and that is with freeway driving.  I will not purchase another RDX."
acura,rdx,2009,fischb, 12/22/2009,Deeply Conflicted,neu,"I am deeply conflicted about this car.  It drives sporty and tight, but on rough pavement it is too bumpy.  There are 3 competing electronic displays, but technology is about 8 years old.  Voice recognition is the worst as is the nav.  Fuel economy is stellar for this segment, 22 MPG, but linear accelleration is impossible due to the mismanaged turbos.  The leather is cheaper than Benz's imitation stuff.  Handling on snow is bad due to torquiness, so I had to get snow tires.  Exterior styling is suspect, but I like its small size.  In the end, I am trading after one year for a BMW X6, if only to save my sanity from the tortuous fan whine when you turn on the heat."
acura,rdx,2009,Priscilla Morris, 12/04/2009,Worst car I have ever owned,neg,"Rough ride, poor interior quality, way too expensive to be this bad . So sad it is such a sorry ride and quality."
acura,rdx,2009,Double L, 02/05/2010,CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID OF,neu,"The dealer would NOT allow us to take on highway; now I know why.  The ride is so bumpy that you feel sick to your stomach.  We can't get the sports suspension changed because it will cause the warranty to be invalid.  I should have walked away after being jacked around by the dealership with agreeing to match printed price of others; and then hemm & ha for 5 hours trying to figure out how to get out of that one.  I should of, could of, and didn't; so now I'm stuck with a vehicle that makes me throw up on bumpy highways or gets us dizzy."
acura,rdx,2009,Disappointed, 11/24/2008,Not Happy,neg,"Very disappointed, poor value for the price.  Seats are uncomfortable (I'm 5'10"", always hitting my thigh on steering wheel); nav system very complicated; voice recognition never accurate (say ""go home"" and nav responds with ""air conditioner off"").  Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position, if wheels are not straight, you will have problems turning the key in the ignition.  Gas mileage is awful; acceleration certainly not 'peppy'; requires premium gas; oil changes require synthetic oil.  Bought this car outright (not leased).  After 2 months I am considering getting rid of this car and buying something more comfortable with better nav & mileage."
acura,rdx,2009,Levelheaded, 06/16/2009,2 Years Later,pos,"This is a jazzed up Honda at best. By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury, in fact, an Accord V6 may be more luxurious. That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV. The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together."
acura,rdx,2009,Ron in Alaska, 09/17/2008,RDX A Great Car For Alaska,pos,"Have less than 1,000 miles on the car and averaged 22 mpg on the second tank of gasoline with both town and highway driving.  The turbo comes on quick, if you need it.  We like the stiff suspension and look forward to the AWD during our long Alaska winters.  This is our third turbo car and they just keep getting better and better.  Enjoying the memory power seats and mirrors with two drivers of different heights.  With the easy to fold-down rear seats, it provides plenty of room for those shopping trips.  We spent a year looking at various crossovers and the RDX always moved to the top of the list.  We keep our cars 12+ years and look forward to a long term relationship. "
acura,rdx,2009,NirVTEC, 09/24/2008,Drivers vehicle!,pos,What a blast to drive! Hugs turns like a sport luxury sedan and pulls off the stoplight like Old V8s I have owned! 
acura,rdx,2009,dba, 10/11/2008,Acura RDX: good deal,pos,"First SUV I own, and very pleased with it. They did a great job to reduce the turbo lag; you can notice it but it is definitely acceptable. Very good looking SUV with the luxury touch you find on all Acuras. Looking forward to try it in snow here in Boston."
acura,rdx,2009,El Supremo, 11/15/2008,Horrible Suspension for NYC,pos,"I bought the car looking at the Mazda CX7, Nissan Murano, etc.  Actually found that the RDX is only a bit more expensive then the Mazda so I went with it.  The look and interior is awesome but its way to stiff.  Every pothole makes the car jump, it feels like an old school jeep.   I bought it for comfort and luxury, but this is way to jeep.  It really gets annoying (even embarrassing sometimes.  I really love the car otherwise but this is a major flaw."
acura,rdx,2009,hm, 11/18/2008,Exactly What I Expected,pos,"This is not my first Acura. These vehicles are designed to be a balance between value and luxury.  Are they German engineered - NO. That said, they are good performers with great reliability. This is a fun vehicle to drive loaded with features that would be costly options on other brands.  Fuel economy is based upon how aggressively you drive and the car is not going to magically transform into something else after to take it home - so give it a good test drive!     "
acura,rdx,2009,Dstew, 11/30/2008,5000 Texas miles with no regrets,pos,Ive been on just about every type of terrain and this SUV has performed admirably.  Highway and street ride and performance is great.  Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged.  On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG.  Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing.  In the city MPG is closer to 18.  On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well.  Dirt roads are the same.  I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle.  Almost every feature you need is included.
acura,rdx,2009,hsm, 01/03/2009,Good Performer,pos,"I have had this vehicle for a litle over 2 months now.  Just got back from a ski trip with the family.  First, let me say the SHAWD is the best AWD system I have ever had.  The vehicle handles snow like you are on asphalt! Mileage is all in how you drive - I am getting between 21 to 24 mpg combined with conservative driving.  Beware that the suspension is stiff - trade-off the vehicles handles very nicely.   "
acura,rdx,2009,Triple, 01/06/2009,Best Bang for the Buck,pos,"Originally we were set on a wagon to replace both a Pathfinder and a Saab sedan. However, when you look at what's out there in similar trim levels (new - Saab, Audi, BMW, Volvo) they get comparable gas mileage, with just a bit more room, but for 10K+ more. That made the RDX a no-brainer. Yes, it has a firm ride - it's on the sport side of SUV. It's much better than a truck-based SUV (such as my PF), and by giving up a Caddy-like ride, you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling. Yes, gas mpg isn't the best - but it also has a turbo that has zero lag with effortless acceleration, and is no worse than other crossovers. This car's not for someone wanting a boring town runabout."
acura,rdx,2009,Mrgoody, 01/09/2009,2009 Acura,pos,"Just got my Acura RDX, overall I like the truck.  0-60 is great and mileage is decent. Build quality is excellent and the cabin is very quiet. However I am disappointed in the way it handles in snow - the car tends to lose rear end during turns in snow, especially if you take the turn fast. I was expecting esp would help but it does not. However in a straight line the truck is solid."
acura,rdx,2009,Disloquitor, 01/27/2009,Nimble Family-first car,pos,"Came off of an A6 4.2 lease, wanted to downsize and have more fun, while allowing my middle-aged body to lift the children into the rear car seats without back break. High center of gravity concerns moot at anything up to 7/10ths driving (i.e. public roads) because of flat cornering and absorbing suspension.  (Absorbing as in GTI, not Buick.) Also useful in deeper snow.  It's not a sports car or sedan, but it's a a brilliant urban/suburban commuter, actually fun on a twisty parkway.  Seats are surprisingly good.  Tighter body structure on rough roads than an X3, no Audi suspension crash.  No Audi interior, leather or BMW brakes or steering either, but not enough difference to justify $15K"
acura,rdx,2009,Dave, 01/29/2009,2009 Acura,neu,"I have had my Acura for 2 months now and have close to 1,800 miles. I have had a rattle on the left hand side of the car since 65 miles. I am bringing it back to the dealer again next week. The cars mpg has never gotten over 16. It is the winter in WI. It handles well in the snow but not any better than my BMW 525XI was. The interior parts are very cheap. It is very bumpy in the city and drives like a jeep wrangler. I had better expectations from this car. It is not of a near luxury type of car. I lease it and have to drive it for another 34 months. I was recently in a Ford Escape that did not rattle like mine and had a quieter ride. Dealer apologizes but tells me I shouldn't expect much."
acura,rdx,2009,Rich, 02/01/2009,Great SUV,pos,"Just purchased this vehicle yesterday and just wanted to say that my family and I enjoy every feature. Very quick in response off the line. Can barely feel the gears shift. Interior very well designed. Many fun options even with a base model. Why spend 4,000 more for a nav and a couple extra speakers? Handling is great. Gas mileage is to be expected from having a turbo installed. To anyone else complaining about this you should do your homework first. Besides wouldn't want to give your car the best of the best servicing? That's what makes cars last longer. Take this for what it's worth yet this car is a great small family vehicle."
acura,rdx,2009,Grant, 03/11/2009,Sea to ski,pos,"My lease had come up on my 05 Infiniti FX35...a beautifully designed and performing vehicle.  I looked at the BMW X3, the Infiniti FX35 and the Acura RDX.  The obvious question was, what was I going to have to give up to move to a less expensive vehicle.  Surprisingly... not much.  Negatives on the RDX no automatic headlights strange... almost awkward styling, poor mileage, no compass, very basic rims, rough ride for some, strange cargo cover.  Big Positves! Sports car handling and acceleration awesome, AWD system,  look at it this way... if money wasn't an object, I'd be deciding between the BMW X6 or the FX50.  Saving some money and not giving up the farm feels pretty good."
acura,rdx,2009,EH, 04/16/2009,2009 RDX,pos,"RDX is my first SUV. It has roomy interior and handles quite nice for its size. The ride quality is not for everyone since it is stiff sport suspension. It's supposed to be an entry level luxury SUV, but I don't really see that. Hope Acura pays little more attention to finish quality since interior rattle is really annoying."
acura,rdx,2009,corduroygt, 06/15/2009,Good value for Money,pos,"I got my RDX tech for around 32k + taxes.  I think for the price, the feature content is great.  I don't know why people think it rides harsh, I think the ride/handling balance is just right, sporty and confidence inspiring without being too harsh or floaty.   The worst thing about this car is the omission of a couple cheap-but-nice features, and the fuel economy, which could have been better if they put the V6 under the hood.  It's got more than enough power to deal with traffic."
acura,rdx,2009,Lynne, 06/15/2009,Love It!,pos,"I just picked up my new RDX & I LOVE IT! I traded in my 10 yr old Saturn which I loved (low maint. & great reliability) but wanted an upgrade in quality (interior, features, etc). I do a lot of driving & the RDX has NOT disappointed so far. I read a LOT of reviews before buying & I have to say that the ride is a little rough but was expecting the ""sporty drive"" so I don't mind it. I have to respectfully disagree w/ complaints about the fuel economy. My 4-cyl Saturn ave. 30mpg, so I was prepared for a big bite into my fuel budget. Have put about 200miles on the RDX so far and I'm ave. 25mpg (60% hwy). Not bad! I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it."
acura,rdx,2009,rd, 08/13/2009,Fun to Drive,pos,"I love this car! I have an Acura MDX too but this thing is fast. The seats are very comfortable, cabin noise is minimal. I do not understand the poor mileage complaint. I have driven the car for last 7000 miles and I have consistently gotten around 22 mpg. Nice leg space in rear seats. Good sound system. Great value for money and without sacrificing the fun part. Fast acceleration when needed. If you are looking into CR-V or RAV4 with all options, please buy this instead. Worth it! Nice ride too. Truly, not bumpy at all. They must have and 'have' softened the suspension since the original 2007 model. Its as good as any other SUV. "
acura,rdx,2009,Jack Gantos, 09/10/2009,Not overly impressed,neu,"I've had my RDX for nearly three years on a lease and I will be turning it in and not getting another. The gas mileage is well below what is listed at 17mpg in town. I live in Boston and drive around town and get about 11/12 miles per gallon, and I'm not a lead foot. The Turbo is not as responsive as it should be--there is some lag, but it is not bad when it kicks in. Just not as perfect as the sales people tell you it is. The interior is basic. Visibility is routine. Body design is nice. But the interior trim is just an upgraded version of a Nisson X-Terra. I question if my ""leather"" seats are really leather. They remind me of the Mercedes leather- like material I had in my Turbo D.    "
acura,rdx,2009,Mark from Sacramento, 10/22/2009,Never Again,neu,"My wife got the car and she seems happy with it, but I think the lack of visibility out the back is dangerous. The rear window is very small and then further blocked by the driver's headrest. Visibility out the driver's side is also bad because of the frame between driver and passenger windows. The real problem is the delay in acceleration which is maddening. Delay is usually 1 second but if you really need to pull in front of a car to make an exit you need to know it may the sequence which is engine revs, wait a second, wait a second, and then car accelerates, but not quickly. I can't believe this is supposed to be a premium car.  Also high hood blocks forward view a little."
acura,rdx,2009,giri80, 03/17/2010,It's almost one year,pos,"I bought this car as a graduation gift for my self! I already have 25,000 miles on the car drove all across the country. So far the ride is fun. Cabin can be a bit quieter, awesome 4 awd handling it's fun to drive in rain and snow. Fuel economy is excellent on hwy (24) but not good in city (17- 18). Interior materials can be of better material. Plastic used is of low quality. I love the seats though. Climate control, audio, back leg room and cargo space very good. I would suggest this buy over a crv, rav4 or Forester any day.   "
acura,rdx,2009,Sue mancasola, 08/29/2018,Dependable,pos,"Oil change is pricey. Around town mileage not good. Love the turbo but I use it too often for quick starts
"
acura,rdx,2010,klrsmile, 01/17/2012,"The Best small upscale SUV, hands down",pos,"Having test driven a variety of its competitors, including some SUVs up-market as well as down (GLK, X3, Q5, Highlander) as well as being a former MDX owner, my wife and I were equally impressed with the RDX, albeit for very different reasons.

He:
Love the performance, 0-60 in about 6 seconds - very impressive, and surprisingly nimble, a very fun car to drive.
The stereo is equally impressive, sounds great and free 12 months subscription to satellite insures something for everyone to listen to.


She:
The cargo space handles weekend shopping and family upkeep with ease.
Crash test ratings help keep the kids safe"
acura,rdx,2010,May 2010 Buyer, 10/08/2010,One happy buyer here,pos,"Having used these reviews in my decision, I'm repaying my debt to the forum.  Great car, would buy it again.  I would recommend to anybody looking for something fully loaded for base price, V6 power in a V4, and luxury without the price. Five months and 8,000 miles later, I can appreciate the quality and workmanship even more.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Will , 03/21/2010,Great Purchase,pos,Bought this instead of the CR-V and GLAD we did.  My wife and I have a small family and wanted something bigger than our Accord but with decent gas mileage but still fun to drive.  This fits the ticket.  Averages 22 mpg w/ mixed driving and got 28 on a road trip.  Ride is a little rough but not bad and is more than likely the quality roads we have in Louisiana.  Love the ability to play my mp3's.  Very happy with purchase.
acura,rdx,2010,Bean, 09/14/2010,Navi,pos,"The RDX is exeptional in every way...I'd recommend it to anyone.  The quality is second to none. But I want to stress the superiority of the NAV package.  After a recent road trip in a friend's Lexus, I am embarrassed for Toyota.  The Honda Navi is far superior...the joy stick, zoom in/out, changing addresses on the go, categories of attractions, etc.  The Acura Navi is intuitive, easy to use, fun and informative.  I only have Lexus' to compare it to, but that Toyota's is a total waste of money. "
acura,rdx,2010,Pleased, 11/25/2009,Love it,pos,"I love Honda Motor Company.  Had an MDX before...which loved.  Opted for 2wd b/c I don't need SH-AWD in TX.  Better mpg...but just barely.  Only complaint on RDX is that any 4 cyl. should get 20 MPG at least.  I'm no lead-foot, but I only average 17 MPG in city. The tech package is great.  Very similar to my MDX's, but also controls my ipod and weather forecast.  Love hands-free talk features and the feel of steering.  I don't use paddle-shifters.  Ride is sportier and quicker than MDX, but just slightly bumpier.  Road noise is great...not an issue. Plenty of room for us, but we don't regularly haul anything other than groceries.  I don't tow anything and don't plan to.    "
acura,rdx,2010,bob, 06/17/2010,Nice Commuter SUV,pos,"I finally found it, a compact crossover SUV that has the right combination of luxury, comfort, and drivability at a reasonable price.  My daily big city commute requires superb acceleration and smooth handling to ensure a safe drive.  The Acura RDX gives me this, is fun to drive, and gets reasonable gas mileage.  The seats are wide and welcoming for my 50+ year old body.  The RDX is a very good value compared to other luxury SUVs.  The base model cost 10-15% less than the other SUVs that I considered, yet had all of the features that I wanted.  And when I sit in it, I can tell that Acura delivers a high quality product. "
acura,rdx,2010,follow-up, 04/16/2010,Follow-up Review,pos,"I originally reviewed after only a few days.  Now I have had it about 6 months.  Great car.  Smaller than my MDX, but same great vehicle.  The computer says I get 19.5 mpg all city driving.  FWD is better on fuel than AWD, but still should be better.  Very peppy and easy to drive.  Turbo is great.  Tech package is a must.  I connected my ipod and love the fact the I can control it with normal stereo controls.  Chevy Traverse drove well, but the interior, road noise, and overall drive doesn't even compare to Acura.  I love it.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Follow-up...again..., 08/14/2010,Follow-up to my previous Follow-up,pos,"I've driven it for a year and I LOVE it.  I wondered if I would miss my bigger SUV after the ""new car"" was gone, but I don't.  This is a great car.  Fun to drive, sporty, and easy to fit into any parking place.  MPG could be better, but on the highway I do a little better than 21 MPG so no complaints.  The Navi is superior to competitors' systems for ex, don't have to be in park to enter a new destination, etc.  With seats folded down, I can fit anything I have needed to carry.  MPG is the ONLY draw-back.  I think a 4 cylinder should do better (even if it drives better than a V6) but that's just me.  I just wanted to assure readers that the car is worth the money.  I'd buy it again!"
acura,rdx,2010,Mark, 06/11/2010,Excellent Value and Fully Loaded,pos,"After testing the BMW X3, Lexus, and Audi Q5 we happily selected the RDX. For the value the ""base"" model includes Bluetooth, heated seats, nice sound system, real time rear camera which shows up in the rear view mirror (pretty cool, just to name a few features.  These features are additional packages in other crossovers and add a great deal to the cost. Moreover, the RDX is fun to drive with plenty of pick up, especially around corners.  "
acura,rdx,2010,hmsq5, 02/28/2011,Fun to drive,pos,"This car puts a grin on my face every time I drive! Granted the front shield can be polarizing but overall the car is incredibly fun to drive. I had a '08 A4 prior to the RDX and the RDX handles corners better than the A4. And with way more power. Noise level between the two is about the same but the turbo growl on the RDX is really pleasant. I find the ride to be very comfortable, steering with good road feel and the interior clean and functional.
We have a '11 Q5 2.0 and the RDX is much more fun to drive. The Q5 is bigger, quieter and feels more numb on the roads. It doesn't handle as well as the RDX, costs $8000 more comparably equip and Acura dealers are >>>>> than Audi."
acura,rdx,2010,sad_owner1, 01/29/2014,I too wish I could return,neu,"The 2010 RDX drives like a dream.
Handles very well especially in the snow.
I loved this car until I've had to make the following warranty replaced repairs...
4 new batteries, Replaced auto start, Replaced Air compressor relay switch, Alternator, Windshield wiper switch and still have issues with windshield wipers.

This sadly, will be my last Acura"
acura,rdx,2010,shivaswrath, 12/27/2009,A great segue for a Sports Car owner,pos,"I used to drive a '05 Mitsubishi Evolution VIII. Family changes forced my hand to the RDX, but I have been continually pleasantly surprised.  VERY responsive engine, love the transmission with the paddle shifters, and excellent interior comforts. I do mostly highway commuting and this car has made every stopped moment in traffic on I-95 heaven. A worthwhile, long-term investment; just bear in mind maintenance isn't cheap since the turbo REQUIRES synthetic Mobil 1 ($100 a dealership). "
acura,rdx,2010,Justin, 06/15/2010,2010 RDX Review - SH-AWD,pos,"First time buying an SUV. Looked at the Rouge, Escape Ltd., CX-7, Tiguan - also higher up the XC-60. For the money (paid $33) the RDX blew away the comp. Love the interior (first 'luxury car'), audio is awesome - leather heated, very comfortable seats (fr and bk). exterior is nice. Very peppy, i merge like a champ w/ the turbo. everyone compliments my new ride, & rightly so. I'm a proud owner BUT MPG is killing me. i need AWD (in Alaska) and I'm averaging 18.5 MPG. I drove a Jetta before, so maybe I'm over reacting but premium fuel and 18.5 is the only thing I'm not thrilled with. If you are in the $30-35k range this is the vehicle hands down. Happy Owner"
acura,rdx,2010,AG, 06/13/2010,2010 RDX,pos,"I am very impressed with my RDX. Excellent on long drives. Power on demand with turbo is awesome! Even without technology package, tech features are great and way ahead of competitors. Solid feel with great agile handling. Cargo area very good for size (much better than BMW). Considering features, tremendous price/value. Gas mileage very acceptable for an SUV (23 mpg after only 3 wks. of ownership)."
acura,rdx,2010,Tim , 08/01/2010,Best Bang for the Buck!,pos,"Researched for 6+ months. Looked at Hyundai, KIa, Ford, Toyota, Honda, GMC, Chevy, Nissan. Drove their small crossovers. For the money, paid under 30, this by far the best of the bunch. Fit and finish is top notch, super quiet ride, great acceleration, easy handling. Had owned a TL several years ago and found this as well built. Cost is 15% to 20% under Infinity, Audi and Lexus. The front wheel dive is as good as AWD costing 2 grand more. Would recommend to all. "
acura,rdx,2010,JR, 08/04/2010,2010 RDX - Impressive vehicle,pos,"The refreshed 2010 RDX is a significant improvement over the 2007 through 2009 in the following ways: 1) The ride is more compliant (suspension improvement) 2) The ride is quieter (the reduction in road noise was immediately noticeable) 3) The turbo is quieter from inside the RDX as well as engine noise which is more muted than before. I think they even changed some of the materials a little bit to quiet things down 4) The leather is improved (softer, more supple) 5) The navigation screen is a bit larger 6) USB interface has been added 7) The front grill on this one actually looks classy and more luxurious than the previous front end. 8) Etc, etc, etc. "
acura,rdx,2010,scallaha, 08/25/2010,Not much to not like,pos,"I read plenty of Edmunds reviews for plenty of different cars before deciding on the RDX so now, I'm giving back. I needed something large enough for my small family (wife and kid), but also something I could look forward to driving.  RDX fits the bill. I'm averaging 21 mpg which really isn't bad for a CUV/SUV size car even with upgrading tires to Bridgestone Alenzas (had to swap the hazardous OE tires with something that has traction). Really happy with the handling and performance balance with mpg.  For a CUV, this is quite a fun car to drive. The interior is nice and the stereo in the tech package is way better than I expected. All in all, I'm quite happy with the purchase."
acura,rdx,2010,Garrett, 10/24/2017,Dream Car...that became a Painful Nightmare,neu,"Just to start off the bat, I am only 21 years old. So, a few of my gripes are because of my specific likes and dislikes. For the first year and a half, the car ran like a dream. The turbo engine passed cars no problem. The interior stayed nice and clean and intact. The transmission shifted nicely. Very rarely was it in the shop for any reason other than A/C recharge or oil change. From May of 2014 until April of 2017, this car was the best decision I made.                                                             That was until April 2017. The first strange thing I noticed was that the car would randomly die. Drive it for a few days, leave it sit for 1, car would be dead. Had to get it towed to auto repair. Simple fix, just changed the battery and recharged. Few weeks later, same situation happened again: car would run fine for 2-3 days, then leave it sit for more than 24 hours, and it wouldn't start. Towed it again, auto service just recharged the battery. Funny story...IT DID IT A THIRD TIME! Took it back to auto service. From that point on, it was a trial and error scenario, seeing which functions and features on the car were constantly draining the battery. Tried that once or twice. Only to have the wrong options selected and towed back to auto service. (All-in-all, this process lead to 4 instances of towing a ""dead"" car and 5 instances of the battery dying.) After a month and a half of this problem continuing, finally found the solution: THE BLUETOOTH MODULE! Always connecting to a nearby device even when the car wasn't running, even when the device was not in range. Had the bluetooth module removed and never put back in again. Summer of 2017, the car is running fine...and actually running again. At 127000 miles, I figured something would start to go. The transmission began to slip, jerk, chug, pop, lock, and drop. Revving the engine up to 3-4 RPMs and it wouldn't move, it would actually decrease speed. On the highway was a worse problem: going 40 mph in a 60 CONSTRUCTION ZONE and it felt like the car was in neutral slipping down the hills as I floored the gas pedal. Braking began to pop when getting close to full stop (right before 10 mph and less) it would chug forward and then stop). At 136,000 miles, it has continued with the problems in the transmission, shifting, and braking and doesn't look to be improving. Dealers and auto mechanics swear there is nothing wrong with transmission or shifting. It feels like a chore to drive anymore. Will be getting a new car soon enough. But....loved the Turbo while it lasted.
"
acura,rdx,2010,dahaad3925, 06/05/2011,Not really good for the money,neu,"The RDX was really convenient for the extra cargo space, but it lacked two things that really bugged me. 1.) storage space in the cabin. There was absolutely no where to put anything out of sight in the cargo compartment. I wish they had put more little cubbies to store stuff in. 2.) The cabin noise when you drive down the street. I could hear everything and it drove me nuts! I am a luxury car owner. Before the RDX I owned a BMW, and in comparison I wanted my BMW back everyday. Overall, I don't think the RDX was worth the almost 40K I paid for it brand new. I'm not going to lie, the surround sound and technology was nice, but it's practicality is why it gets a partial substandard review."
acura,rdx,2010,amit batt, 10/06/2009,Wish I could return it,neg,"We bought this car to downsize from our Volvo XC90 - and be more ""green"". What a mistake! The mileage is no better despite the miserably small cabin and trunk (looks big but doesn't hold much). This car should never be bought by a family - if you are a young couple who doesn't drive far or carry much (or mind the 90+ dB road noise) , then, I have a vehicle for you."
acura,rdx,2010,David Collantes, 08/08/2015,Avoid at all cost,neg,"Very unreliable car, poorly manufactured. ""Leather interior"" is not quite leather, instrumentation will not give you details on battery not charging, or similar issues until it is fully dead. Ride is not comfortable, ""eats"" gas like a monster. Overall craft of the car is poor. Will never buy an Acura again, unless it comes straight from Japan.
"
acura,rdx,2010,trome, 11/08/2009,A Winner!,pos,"I picked up my RDX today and found the fit and finish to be excellent and the seats the most comfortable I have ever sat in except perhaps for Volvo. I priced up a Volvo XC60 and if you option it out with things that are standard on the base RDX like leather, blue tooth, heated seats, XM rado, bi xenon lights, sunroof you would be looking at a 38k car. I paid 31k for my RDX and feel it was the bargain of the century! Especially after considering a RAV4 v6 which the dealer wanted 28k for and it does not even compare to the Acura."
acura,rdx,2010,Robert McGuire, 11/14/2009,2010 RDX (AWD),pos,"I have only had this vehicle for two weeks but I have enjoyed it very much. It is fun to drive, has the power I need when merging on to the highway and I love when the turbo kicks in. Not very pleased with the road noise and you feel every bump,  that's something that my wife and I both agree on. The road noise you can get use to but the bumps are another thing."
acura,rdx,2010,raza, 11/17/2009,RDX 2010 SH-AWD with Tech,pos,Absolutely best car I ever drove. All wheel drive is a blast to drive in the rain and snow... the tech in the car is amazing. The only downside is the gas mileage getting about 17-19 on highway.  Probably needs to break in some more. Pretty quick for a 4 cylinder. Seats are very comfortable. 
acura,rdx,2010,Maria, 12/12/2009,Not Bad for a 1st time SUV owner,pos,"I have owned this car since August 2009.  I got it using the Cash for Clunkers program.  I am overall pleased with the car.  The gas mileage could be better but it is a 4cyl. turbo.  I used to have only 6 cyl. vehicles and this car is faster than what I used to own.  I wish we could use regular gas.  It is fun to drive, handles the road well, great technology and love the heated seats.  It suits the needs of my small family and I also did not want a large SUV being that this is the first time that I have owned an SUV."
acura,rdx,2010,Acuraman, 01/07/2010,The good just got better!,pos,"This is the second RDX that I have owned.  Acura has done an excellent job in this mid- model change improving those areas of complaint by owners of the 2007-2009 models, such as road noise, braking performance, ride stiffness, etc."
acura,rdx,2010,Bill, 03/09/2010,Awesome,pos,"This is the second Acura I have owned, the MDX being the first. All things considered it is the best small SUV on the market period. I looked at them all- BMW, VW, Audi, etc. As long as you are not looking for a troop transport it has plenty of space."
acura,rdx,2010,Les, 03/20/2010,Better than a Lexus?,pos,"Prior to buying this vehicle, I researched the Lexus RX 350, the Volvo XC 60, the Audi Q5, and the Ford Escape. I test drove the Volvo. Most of these vehicles, are over $40,000, plus tax and license, and that is w/o many of the amenities that come standard with the RDX. The RDX interior is very nice. It is functional and user friendly. The bluetooth is very easy to set up and operate. The rear view mirror has a back up camera. It is amazing how much you get for under $32,000. I am still waiting to see how the gas mileage is going to be. My Lexus IS 350, got about 19 miles a gallon. If I can get that, I'll be happy.    "
acura,rdx,2010,Jeanie, 03/20/2010,Fun SUV,pos,"What a fun SUV! I've owned my RDX for 2 weeks now. Got it to replace my Toyota Sienna minivan in order to downsize with one of three kids now off to college. It's a smaller car for me, and I haven't traveled in yet yet with luggage, but so far I love it. VERY fun to drive. Unbelievable pick- up and handling. Comfortable. Easy to learn controls on the dash.  My one negative is the stiff bumpy ride. I'm used to a carlike ride, so learning to tolerate the bumps will be a challenge. Also, when using the bluetooth and ipod on my iphone, the ipod sound will not work. I've got to figure that one out soon!"
acura,rdx,2010,tom w, 07/01/2010,Just Perfect For Us,pos,Can't tell you how much we like this car. We looked and drove many others before making our choice. It is the wife's car but I find myself making excuses all the time to drive it. Very fun to drive. Just like a go kart on take off. A lot of bang for your buck. Ours is black and we get a lot of people looking and asking about the car. It looks great. The people a Acura were very nice to deal with also. We leased and found the $0 down lease deal to be one of the best offered anywhere. My wife only puts about 10k a year which is what's offered in the lease. You can pre-buy extra miles which is smart if you drive a lot. If you put more than 12k a year you should purchase the car not lease.
acura,rdx,2010,Chuck, 02/23/2010,Shop around for best prices,pos,I recently purchased the Acura RDX front wheel drive with technology package. Excellent car alot of power for a 4cyl. Interior controls are very accessible.  The handling is very good for a SUV.  The sound system is really good.  Overall I love this vehicle would definitely recommend to friends.
acura,rdx,2010,Jonathon Wacek, 08/30/2009,Great Sports Car,pos,"When looking at crossovers it was hard to find one with design, reliability, and power.  My wife wanted a CRV but I was not impressed with the small engine (166 hp for a big vehicle).  I tried to convince my wife about the RAV4 with a V6 engine but she didn't like the style.  We found the Acura and I believe it is a great compromise (250 hp!!).  Great power and reliability I wanted, with the looks and feel she wanted.  To my surprise it was only $2,000 more than a loaded CRV or RAV4 after neg.  We have had it for about a month and my wife loves it.  I am not impressed with the gas mileage.  With a prius 17-19mpg hurts. As a crossover it fits our wants but we don't use it for towing or haul."
acura,rdx,2010,Charles, 05/11/2010,Great around town vehicle,pos,"This car is a blast to drive.  I'm a long time Acura MDX driver and the RDX is a lot more fun in daily highway/city driving.  When I'm not cranking up the turbo, I seem to average about 23 mpg with the 2-wheel drive."
acura,rdx,2010,Renaki, 05/17/2010,Excellent Value,pos,"Finally we decided on the Acura RDX. After test driving and debating over 13 different suvs this was the winner in the end.  The choice came down to a balance of value, creature comforts, and performance.  With the deal we received on the RDX it's hard to find another vehicle in the same class that offered up the comfort of the seating, the rear cargo room (61 cubic ft), the technology niceties etc for the price.  I was shocked at how comfortable the seats were after riding in the vehicle all weekend and the audio features are excellent.  Fuel economy is my biggest gripe and it would be nice to have some reclining seats in the back like other competitors.  All in all this is an excellent car"
acura,rdx,2010,ezma, 09/25/2013,Overpriced so-so SUV,neg,"I hoped the turbo is fun to drive. In order to get a car like this, performance is a must, but it doesn't. Use premium gas plus high priced in maintenance, this car is failed to qualify as a luxury SUV. The NAV is the worse one on market. I don't even want to use it because the lack of touch screen. To operate the NAV feel so dump. Turbo kick in is similar to the down shift gear. Bit just too slow. I would say even RAV4 V6 is way better than this junk. So this is a way overpriced with really bad performed SUV. 2010 to 2012 are the same. 2013 and later changed to V6 but no more SH-AWD. I don't see what's the position of this SUV."
acura,rdx,2010,momof2, 09/07/2009,Not worth the money,neu,"I bought this car due to cash for clunkers.  I think I would have like this car better had I not driven or knew about the Tiguan (no inventory available).  No rear air vents, back seats don't move, sunroof is weak and virtually no power outlets (1).  Luxury is a far reach for this car.  All the thought was put into technology rather than make the vehicle functional.  The dual air zone is for the front seats...I guess they don't think anyone will sit in the back as if the back seat is just decoration.  The vehicle does drive smooth and has great control but cabin noise is another ""non luxurious"" characteristic."
acura,rdx,2010,geohov, 11/03/2009,Great sports car,pos,"This vehicle handles better than any car I've ever owned.  It does have a hard ride though.  My friends think it was over $50k.  Quality is first rate. It's my wife's car, but I take it for a ride whenever I can."
acura,rdx,2010,sea_level, 11/29/2009,"Fun to Drive, but...",pos,"I love how it handles and it is a blast to drive.  It is a pleasure to drive on long road trips.  The GPS, XM and Bluetooth work well, especially for handsfree phone calls. It has plenty of power and the AWD makes corners fun.   However, it has a firm to rough ride and lots of engine noise especially at low speeds.  The tone of the engine sound reminds me of a very low-end econo car, not something that costs in the high $30's.  The leather used on the seats seems sort of low quality, along with the carpet.  The seats are extremely comfortable though.  Overall, I do think it is a very good little SUV and will probably be very reliable for many year.  It just has a couple of drawbacks.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Sandra, 03/04/2010,RDX Review,pos,"I'm a first time Acura purchaser in her 50s.  I reviewed several SUVs of this size and type (including BMW X3) but the RDX kept coming to the top of my final list.  And I'm really happy with my choice, it was the right one for me.  I  really liked both the test drive and the time the dealership spent on answering my questions. Its a very comfortable ride, and I ride high up, which I like.  I feel very safe in my car and it gets me where I need to go.  I've only had it a month and have more to learn about its many features (the tech features are amazing), but it will come in time.  "
acura,rdx,2011,Carguy, 08/12/2015,Nice Comfortable Turbo Crossover,pos,"We have a 2011 RDX base FWD...as a driver,very comfortable seats,easy to read gauges nice panoramic view with low dashboard... easy to get in and out.. a blast to drive when you spool the Turbo,lots of torque but beware if you keep spinning the tires (burnouts) front driver side axles might go out easily, you would notice a vibration on low speed acceleration,will go away when coasting... this problem is only on FWD models between 50-70k miles when ABUSED(easyfix)  You NEED to use synthetic engine oil religiously on schedule for the turbo bearings and seals to last long (all turbo engines) ..otherwise you will start to have leaks from your turbo. You just have to be mindful of your scheduled maintenance and not to abuse it's power otherwise with over 90k miles now we love our RDX no problem whatsoever.....with a small growing family moving to the burbs we sold our Lancer EVO and Subaru WRX for an RDX and an RX.... I would recommend the RDX to my family and friends....you get a lot of car for your money.   This is the ONLY Acura that the Shield front grill is actually functional as an air intake hood scoop for your top mount intercooler. If you are buying a used RDX make sure you check it's history,all original stock meaning no modification has been done,if buying from a private party it is worth to pay a 3rd party to inspect the mechanical condition of the car,if buying from a dealer make sure you can get an extended warranty.. Since the Turbo RDX is no longer in production and if you do not want a used vehicle the KIA Sportage SX (SX ONLY) would be a good car to consider .......  Thanks for reading... Happy Motoring!

acura,rdx,2011,thumper16, 04/11/2011,4 Wheeled Vette,pos,"Haven't had this thing long, but what a step up from an underpowerd Honda CRV. Handling, power, fit and finish, all first class. Don't buy it if your looking for smooth. It is sportscar all the way. Drove the Infinity, Benz, and Lexus, all 10 grand or more expensive. I'm 6'2"" and have plenty of room. Acually bought it for my wife and we arm wrestle for the key. If they could make this thing get 30mpg's it would be just about perfect."
acura,rdx,2011,farrellg, 06/04/2011,Mostly Up,pos,"Mostly a good experience, but small cargo capacity, small place for driver's stuff.
Backup camera not good in bright sunlight.
Nice drive with turbo and shifting, but poor mileage + uses high price gas.
With Honda/Acura reliability, it should be very good.
Would make changes in seating.
Hard ride for all.
Guess the MDX might have been a better choice.
Should get better mileage."
acura,rdx,2011,njrdx, 04/16/2015,Nice certified off-lease ride,pos,"Purchased my 2011 as an off-lease Acura certified SUV.  Got it for just under $23k with 30k miles and warranty good until 65k miles.  

Bought it Fall of 2014 and used it thru a tough winter, the SH-AWD was great!    Has  36k miles now so have had it enough time to get very familiar.   Do a mix of local and highway driving and it handles both well.   With the rear seats down, plenty of room to haul things, the dog, etc.  

This is a good used car buy if all  maintenance  and servicing has been done.  Turbo engines need on time oil changes.   Buying as certified used from Acura is a good way to make sure this is the case. "
acura,rdx,2011,KP, 11/03/2010,Fun to drive,pos,"So far, so good! Moved up from CR-V. The Acura has been fabulous to drive, very quiet and smooth. Interior is much more practical than CR-V and easier to adjust various things, and the engine/pick-up goes w/o saying. Exterior seems nice, get lots of compliments.  Looked at Q5 and X3, for the money I think I got the best deal.  Only complaint is the gas mileage. Yes, it is turbo charged, but a combined mpg around 23 would be more reasonable for a 4cy. On 5 tanks I get b/w 18-25mpg with 60% highway/40% city driving and not engaing the turbo charger as hard/often. Most weeks are lower end of range 18-20mpg.  OEM tires seem OK so far, won't know for sure until Winter hits."
acura,rdx,2011,JAMES, 10/21/2010,RDX Review,pos,"This car looks small and drives like a small car but interior/cargo space is plenty.  I am 6'2 and i have plenty of rooms to spare. Acceleration and handling is great and coming from Civic Si and evo IX, this car definately deserves the title of sportiest CUV in the market.  I opted for AWD without the technology package and it has everythingy. I cannot justify the price of $3000 on navigation.  Overall, excellent vehicle with great value."
acura,rdx,2011,jps1010, 10/26/2010,Good value,pos,"After considering a number of different vehicles I finally narrowed it down to the RDX, the Nissan Murano and the Audi Q5.  I thought the Audi was the nicest of the trio but the price and the long term reliability concerned me.  The Murano was also very nice, however, I have heard there have been numerous problems with the CVT transmission.  I believe the Acura gave me the best bang for the buck due to their proven reliability, 4 year warranty and convenience of getting a loaner in case anything significant is wrong with the car."
acura,rdx,2011,tpf1979, 02/04/2012,Huge bang for the buck,pos,"With BMW, Audi, and Mercedes getting all the attention in the luxury crossover market, the RDX is too often overlooked. I have owned my 2011 RDX base (front wheel drive) for 8 months and love it. You get a lot for your $30,000. Stellar acceleration and handling, all the creature comforts, and a premium feel (though not quite as ""premium"" as the German competitors). If you want to save a few thousand dollars and still get an excellent vehicle- give the RDX a long, hard look before jumping into that BMW.
If you do not live in Alaska or extreme north east, consider front wheel drive for even a better value. I live in NJ and am getting through the winter just fine with my front wheel drive RDX."
acura,rdx,2011,Siva, 10/08/2010,Great Car-SUV,pos,"I love this one - I have been dring Honda Civic, Accord, Odyssey, Ford and others Tried Pilot, New Odyssey, Sienna, Routan, BMW X3, MDX and finally went with RDX Unbelievable feeling Drove - 600 miles around houston - local + highway - avg 21mpg"

Very reliable vehicle so far, but not one bringing home awards and has squeaks and rattles all over.

Bought a 2011 Certified RDX Tech Package less than two weeks ago.
Not many sold, so I consider them the few, the unknown vehicle.
Very comfortable seats.
Toys galore that I have to concentrate on the road when driving.
Just a much different driving experience than what I am used to.
Yes, the suspension is much firmer, but taking a corner is fun.
I don't slam on the turbo, as I do see how it eats gas.
If you don't slam turbo, I just averaged 25.5 mpg according to computer. "

$30,500 - sales price 
 
$33705.31 - w/tax, reg, lic, transfer, titling, Ca tire, doc prep & dmv e filing fees... 
 
Worked with the two Internet guys at Niello Acura in Sacramento. Both of these men made it so easy. Emailed what I wanted. Got a quote back. A few back and forths, a test drive and only 1 hour of office time. 
 
Found setting the c/c and varying gears (3,4,5,4,3...) using s mode is a great way to allow you to varying rpm (for proper break-in) while keeping the same speed while crusing the hiway. 
 
We are very happy with the RDX and the great price we got. 

Can't really review the Reliability when its not even broken in. "
acura,rdx,2011,thinkbig, 02/12/2012,rdx with tech package,pos,"I wanted a small SUV for more utility, ability to go through flooded streets and for a change of lifestyle. Was in a Camry for many years but hated not having no power and feeling like a old man. Printed a bunch of pictures of SUVs and showed it to my girlfriend. She Pick the Acura and I went down and got it. I think it was good decision as it is upscale and I needed to treat myself to something more than another Toyota. Reliable, safe, fun to drive, and that Turbo 4 is nice change of pace. Fuel economy is about what I expected around 18-19 range city. It uses premium fuel. When new the fuel economy was down to 16-17. "
acura,rdx,2011,Grant Albert, 04/11/2016,RDX is perfect!,pos,"I bought this car for my son who just turned 17.

Great ride, larger size but not too large, comfortable, expects to be reliable and is expected to be safe.

I don't love the car, but we needed towing and I wanted a hatchback and this fit the bill at a decent price, and my husband is a Honda/Acura loyal follower.
It is very nice car inside, but it is lacking in some areas. "

I would at least recommend taking a look at this vehicle if you like Lexus and Acura vehicles.
The handling was surprisingly better than expected.
The staff and ammentites at the dealership were on par or better than many of the more expensive options.
My dealer Phuong Davidson took her time and thoroughly explained my vehicles features and options even after I bought it and was professional and patient.
The rest of the staff and management were also polite and easy going.
I would recommend a visit to Pohanka Acura."
acura,rdx,2011,sylvanpt, 09/23/2013,Not great for a petite woman!,neu,"When I test drove the car, it seemed perfect for my height--5'.
It is not. Since buying the car and driving it, I'm having difficulty parking it. I can see over the hood, but something about the front end--length?-- causes me parking problems. Seat height limited--needs another 1-2"". Seat belt doesn't lower where attached and cuts me across the throat.
Passenger seat does not go up and down; husband needs a high seat to enter the car due to back problems and now has a difficult time getting in.
Would not have bought the car had I been aware. No push button to lower rear door--have to stand on tip-toe to grasp the handle.
Looks more like a station wagon, not SUV.
Want my RAV 4 back!"

acura,rdx,2012,scotch1, 12/21/2011,My first Japanese car,neu,"My first choice was a BMW X3 or Audi Q5, but the price was about 9K to 10K more than the RDX. The car is sporty, fun to drive, good seating confort in the front and rear seats. Love the surround sound stereo, Nav and Blue Tooth. The voice commands to operate most controls is hit or miss. Have about 3K in miles so far, average about 19 to 20 in town driving. The ride is a bit stiff, but NVH is good. Have owned 4 Volvos, the RDX is much more compliant with impact harshness than any of my Volvos. Yeah, I hate the beak front end, but at least is does not look like the Nissan Joke, I mean Juke. Most Japanese cars lack the sense of design when to BMW or Mercedes."
acura,rdx,2012,Mike, 02/02/2016,An experiment gone awry,neg,"Not only the worst Acura I have ever owned (this is 4th, two MDXs and one TL), its seriously the most poorly engineered car i've had the misfortune to own.  Hyperactive turbo charger fully engages at the slightest touch.  Tranny needed to be replaced at 45k miles - Japanese engineering, this is where you've ended up?  gas mileage is beyond bad for a 4-banger.  Both front windows are loose/rattle.  The interior controls are so complicated as to feel like you are on camera and the joke is on you.  Only feature i can really commend is the handling, which is excellent.  However, ultimately this just feels like a new concept (small crossover SUV) that was done quickly, and thus poorly, which may explain its utter lack of marketplace acceptance
"
acura,rdx,2012,Anton, 05/27/2018,Good for the price,pos,I purchase this after I sold my Jeep. This SUV is fun to drive and roomy on the inside for me I am 6.2.

acura,rdx,2012,austonian, 01/14/2012,Great Car!,pos,"I traded my '07 BMW X3 for the '12 RDX.
I wanted reliability in a small luxury SUV - which I expect from and Acura and was not getting from BMW.
I expected the RDX to be a bit of a let down from the X3 from a driving perspective, but I was way wrong.
I absolutely love driving the RDX!
It's peppy, has a lighter, crisper feel, and I love the interior, which has very comfortable seats.
No complaints from me.
This has turned out to be a very good choice.
(BTW, the '13 RDX was revealed at the Detroit Auto Show this week.
IMO, the new body is very generic and too rounded.
Get thee to an Acura dealer fast if you want the current RDX's distinctive look and lines.)"

The vehicle is most everything we hoped it would be. We compared and drove most every compact suv and picked the RDX because we felt it was the best value for a well equipped suv. While the RDX is not the most nimble handling in its segment it is IMO the most comfortable. We averaged 28.6 MPG on the trip, better than I hoped for.
This car is a great road trip car, again comfortable, quiet w/ very little driver fatigue after hours behind the wheel. The smooth and plentiful power of the V6 was a joy in the mountains and passing. We like the car and would make the decision to buy [it again. "

I researched the 2013 RDX hard before we made our decision. Great choice. All of the websites said the the average price paid (TMV) for this model was a little over $37K. I was able to get it just a little under $36K.

I would compare this to a Lexus RX350, it's a little smaller, but about $9K less.

Great decision...."

This is an awesome Crossover with performance on par to sport sedans.
Those who say it's basically the same as the Honda CRV have no clue what they are talking about.
For one thing, the V6 just shines...it instills confidence and I actually look forward to driving.
Try drive up a hill in the RDX and you will understand it's capabilities.
Secondly the technology for value can't be beat.
I recommend going for the technology package if you can afford it. You
get a very convenient power lift gate and an awesome 410 watt sound system which plays music in all sorts of ways (CD, DVD-Audio, XM radio, Bluetooth, Ipod)"

Traded my '07 MDX for better gas mileage and because I only used 3rd row twice last year. The RDX is so much better than the Lexus RX that I was considering. RX may have a few more options but the Lexus RX ride is ""mushy"" compared to the quick and nimble Acura RDX. My husband, who drives a BMW 535i, LOVES my RDX - he always wants to switch cars!
The RDX is roomy yet sporty; super smooth, agile and quick. We have 3 kids and they fit comfortably in the back seat (my oldest is 5'7""). I would have like one more option pkg (heated steering wheel, heated 2nd row seats, wood grain trim) but not a deal breaker. We are very happy for the value of the RDX for the price. "

My lease was up on my '09 Murano SL AWD & I wanted something a little different. I drove the RDX in 2009 & felt the ride wasn't comfortable & the gas mileage wasn't great. On the 2013, these two issues have been 100% corrected & it's a far more comfortable vehicle to drive. The V6 performance is more than adequate, handling is stable & it's fun to drive. A few features I'd like to have are missing on the base AWD but I wasn't willing to spend the $3400 more for the Tech package when I don't need the navigation system. Compared to the BMW X3 or Q5, I'm pleased with the value I got here & lots of extra comfort features are included. Way to go!"

The RDX has plenty of pick up and drives very smoothly but still sporty. My husband likes it so much that he is now driving it and has left me with his BMW five series because he finds the RDX so much more comfortable (he's 6'1"" and there's plenty of leg and head room)

I was looking for a smaller SUV that was fun to drive, had good gas mileage, the right amount of space, a bit of luxury, and was priced right.
After the first 60 days, I'm convinced the RDX was the best choice.

The RDX offers good styling, a luxury interior, a very peppy ride, quiet inside, and a relatively smooth ride.
I wouldn't consider the handling as sporty, but this isn't an Acura TL either.

For relatively $10k less than others brands in the category, the RDX is a solid choice."
acura,rdx,2013,mongomrp, 08/20/2012,Great Car,pos,"I bought a 2013 Acura RDX about two months ago. This is a great vehicle. I have not seen much advertising or talk about the RDX so I thought I'd speak up for it. My two most recent vehicles were a 2006 Nissan Murano (still in the family) and a 2011 Honda CRV (traded it in for the RDX). I like the RDX far better than either of those. It has a smooth quiet ride, good power and gets 22.5 mpg in mixed city street and city freeway driving. It looks great, it drives well and I'd recommend it to anyone who asked."
acura,rdx,2013,vegasmurano, 02/23/2013,"Impressive,very impressive",pos,"Let me start by saying I have owned over 80 cars (yes, but my insanity is another subject),and can easily afford ANY car I choose. This SUV blew me away by how nice it is for the price you pay. As like other reviewers, I looked at X3,Q5,Evoque,SRX and a few others. Feature for feature the RDX was $6k to $14k less and it drives smoother on the road than most of them. Handling is certainly not as sporty then many, but much smoother and more refined. And surprisingly in straight line acceleration it is as quick or quicker than my Acura TL-SH AWD and all of the trucks listed above (assuming the base engines).FYI I also currently own a BMW X3...."
acura,rdx,2013,blackdogrdx, 05/29/2012,2013 RDX AWD - Great Crossover!,pos,"This 2nd Gen RDX is awesome! The room of a crossover/wagon, AWD, 25ish MPG overall, excellent driver comfort, very roomy rear seat, high quality base audio, standard rear view camera, reliability of Honda/Acura, smooth 6 speed auto transmission, and a strong and quiet V-6. 
It is definitely a must-test-drive if you are in the small to mid size SUV market and willing to spend $35-40k. It matches up well against the X3, Q5, even Touraeg. 
A word of warning - do not test drive if it is out of your price range. If you are considering a CR-V or Rav 4 and don't want to add $10-15k, don't make yourself miserable."
acura,rdx,2013,wak52, 06/20/2013,After almost a year of ownership....,pos,"After a year and two road trips, here are my general impressions.

Pros:
Great mileage (28 mpg on the road), comfortable ride, good acceleration, good audio system, good dash/control layout, great ergonomics.

Cons:
Interior finish uninspiring, fit and finish from factory not in the same class as other luxury brands, rear hatch can only be opened with dash control after all the doors have been unlocked. 

We've had the car in for two fit and finish repairs.
It took the dealer three tries to a problem with the front bumper cover coming loose from fender (dealer didn't want to replace broken cover).
Then the passenger roof rain gutter molding was loose, causing a horrible vibrating noise."
acura,rdx,2013,dbnutmeg, 09/17/2013,Great with a few flaws,pos,"After ten months and 22k miles I love this vehicle.
It's super comfortable, quiet and has a stable ride on all kinds of roadways.
On extended interstate trips I get over 30 mpg.
The back-up camera is fantastic.
There's excellent space in front, back and cargo area.
All the basics are well done: it's a great value.
So, what's not to like.
The onboard navigation system is effectively useless.
Too dated and too many basic destinations not in the database--or not findable.
Voice recognition just doesn't stack up even if you can remember the hundreds of commands and proper syntax.
And you can't make adjustments to the route while driving.
I now use my old Garmin portable GPS."
acura,rdx,2013,clquake1, 12/19/2012,'13 Non Tech AWD RDX,pos,"As an owner of an '08 RDX and a '13, I can tell you the ride quality is much better, don't let the harsh reputation of the outgoing model discourage you.
It's also not a floaty car, if you want that, go with a Lexus, or '70's-'80's Cadillac.
Despite my very heavy lead foot, averages 21 mpg in heavy city/stop & go driving.
This is not a CRV as another commenter/troll said, who clearly does not own any RDX.
Uses premium gas, don't listen to a) the sales guy or b) someone who thinks they know better that the teams of engineers that designed it.
Brakes are a bit touchy.
Materials quality not on par with MB/Audi, but also not priced like MB/Audi."
acura,rdx,2013,Sandy Robins, 09/02/2015,BUY A LEXUS INSTEAD!,neg,"I have owned this car for 1 1/2 years. Soon after purchasing had to have the back shocks replaced (under warranty). The dealer claimed to know nothing about shock problems but the other 4 people that I personally know that have this car have had to have their shocks replaced as well, some more than once.

Recently my A/C quit working without incidence or warning.  When I called the dealer where I purchased the car I was told ""maybe a pebble jumped up and put a hole in your condenser"". I dismissed this as very unlikely as I had never heard of such a thing in my 40 years of driving nor did I hear, see or run over anything.  Well he was right and since caused by road debris would not honor the warranty.  Repair $750.  I researched this issue and found that Honda/ Acura had a previous class action suit settled in 2010 for 38.5 Million FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS!!!!!!
 Suit claimed placed  where road debris can hit it easily and thin metal was used. Said ""Parts that fail and they know it"". 
My husband called Acura Customer Service which is apparently a joke.  Explained we owned a Honda Pilot and CRV previously and purchased the RDX and TSX to upgrade to a premium car. Again a joke. They refused to fix under warranty or even discount the repair at all. Apparently no concern that we have purchased 4 vehicles. NOT ANYMORE!!!!
They apparently are still having A/C condenser failing issues. Any of you Attorneys want a class action?

acura,rdx,2013,jude123, 09/13/2012,"Great Car, Great Value",pos,"Have had car for two weeks now and am very happy with it.
Seats are very ergonomic and comfortable especially on long drives.
Gas mileage is good, about 23 mpg for mixed driving, and about 28-30 mpg on highway.
Sound system with the technology package is amazing!
Bluetooth works great.
Navigation very easy to use and screen is nice quality.
Voice recognition is a neat feature.
Leather interior is very good quality and durable.
Ride is pretty smooth (maybe not as smooth as Lexus RX) but still pretty nice.
V6 engine is plenty zippy, never felt sluggish merging or passing. A lot of features are standard (would cost extra with other similar cars), so good value overall."

acura,rdx,2013,wdkymys, 01/04/2013,Love this car - getting better every day,pos,"Shortlisted the RDX and Q5 (also looked at X3 and XC60).
Q5 is a great vehicle but similarly equipped, was $7K more than the RDX.
The RDX was so well equipped and drove so well, I figured $7K was too much to pay for the Audi badge.

1000 miles now on my AWD RDX and loving it.
Ride is incredibly smooth, quiet and relaxing (better than Q5).
The last poster who says it rides rough doesn't own this car and probably hasn't even driven one.
If there was a problem here, at least one professional reviewer would have mentioned it.

Handling is really impressive too. Q5 is better, but seriously, how often are you driving slalom courses? I've hit 32MPG twice in highway driving vs 27MPG expected."
acura,rdx,2013,endoellen, 01/26/2013,Purchased RDX with Tech 2 weeks ago,pos,"Has great pick up and shifts smooth as I would have expected.
My previous car was an Acura TL 2006 which I really liked.
Voice commands for phone, navigation, audio, etc. is not real user friendly.
Too many commands to be used.
It was easier to use voice commands with the bluetooth in the TL without navigation.
Disappointed in gas mileage.
Sticker states estimated 20 city and 28 hwy.
My first tank of premium fuel with combined 60 miles of hwy driving and the rest city only got 17.5 mpg.
On my 2nd fill up I traveled to the dealer & back today approx. 120 miles hwy & it shows average of 23mpg.
Not what I expected. My 2006 TL got 20 city & 28-30 Hwy consistently."
acura,rdx,2013,english_august, 10/31/2012,Everything that you want - and then some,pos,"The 2013 RDX is the best value for money in the luxury small-SUV segment. While competitors such as the X3, GLK, and RX 350 probably exceed RDX on many or most parameters, a comparably equipped car from those manufactures is $6,000 - $10,000 more expensive. 

If you are considering a loaded mainstream SUV brand (such as the CR-V EX-L), then you owe it to yourself to put the RDX on your shortlist. For about $5,000 - $7,000 more, you get better engine, aesthetics, reliability, build quality, luxury features such as keyless entry and brand cachet. "
acura,rdx,2013,Phil, 02/07/2016,"Extremely underrated; fast, Struts a problem",pos,"2013 model passenger seat is non adjustable. No back seat air vents. Light and nimble for its size. Looking for a 2019 now. Still a great car. Fast, powerful engine. Tried to trade for 2017, but just couldn't make a deal. One oddity of this year: rain on the roof sounds like a 'tin roof'. Supposedly this solved in new RDX. Great stereo.
Update: 8/19/18 Bullet proof and fast. Looks brand new inside and out. White/tan. $40 oil changes from dealer. Had  minor squeak in steering wheel which dealer fixed early on.

Update: 2/20/19 One rear strut fixed (under recall), dealer refused to fix other even after our insistence. 2nd strut now creating extremely irritating thumping. Only 35K miles. Still in great shape. Our other car is a Honda Crosstour (2012) a great car, same engine, solid. Apparently Honda dealers are better to work with.

Very comfortable, nice interior.
Good for taller folks - we are both over 5'10'.
Great value - cost 6K less than
than a comparatively equipped Volvo S60 - which is the other car I looked at - and the gas mileage is much better.
I got over 30MPG on the highway.
And you never know when the active cylinder management system is in use - it's smooth and seamless."
acura,rdx,2013,tinpyro, 08/05/2013,Disappointment,neu,"I have owned many luxury vehicles over the years, when I initially came across the 2013 RDX I thought that I had discovered a true bargain. This , however, was not the case. The reason TRUE luxury vehicles cost more is because they are worth it. The RDX has flaws that I can over look but the wind noise from the doors and b pillars is simply unforgivable in a vehicle in this range. The dealer has done what it can but they cannot redesign the vehicle. Acura must be aware of this issue and I believe is simply choosing to ignore it. Had I taken a more extensive test drive I would not have purchased the vehicle, so...shame on me. I will unload the vehicle asap and accept the loss and move on."
acura,rdx,2013,hondacom, 02/17/2013,I love my RDX.,pos,I purchased my 2013 RDX three months ago. I downsized from a full size truck to this SUV. I wanted one a few years ago but decided to wait for the V6 engine. It uses about 30% less fuel than my truck did. I do most of my driving in the city and the shorter wheelbase makes maneuvering in traffic and parking easy. This vehicle fits me like a glove.
acura,rdx,2013,gby, 09/23/2012,"Rdx, Your almost perfect",pos,"Acura hit a triple with this one. Not a home run yet. I think this might have been a careful move on ACURA's
design team. I really can't blame them.I own my 2013 rdx close to two weeks now and I must say its been a delight. I wish it just had a bit more luxury touches like the MDX, But you can't have it all. If you want to have it all then I guess buy the MDX. When I
made my purchase there were alot to consider and the main one was reliability. Honda motor company consistently manufactures reliable vehicles. I have tried other brands and have found out time and time again there is nothing like a honda product, no matter what level of vehicle you want to drive. "

It is just the right size- not too big nor too small.
The engine gives grunt when you want it- I've chirped the wheels a few times :-)
The interior is very comfortable and spacious-everything is right where it is supposed to be. Fit & finish is perfect-no issues popping up in the first 30 days of ownership. City mileage has been 19 so far with little highway driving.
Was waiting for 13 Escape, 13 Terrain Denali- both priced higher similarly optioned- glad I didn't wait!"
acura,rdx,2013,rjxg, 01/22/2014,"Well rounded car, Navigation is substandard",pos,"I have been driving my RDX AWD w/Tech for 7 month now and really like the car.
Plenty of power and I find it to be a great value for the cost.
My only issue with the car is the poor quality of the navigation system.
It is like using DOS commands on a PC.
A million things to remember and it take 5 minute to enter an address.
I am shocked Acura put it out there for use like this.
Otherwise the car is good but it is hard to overlook a Navi system so frustrating I don't even us it unless I have no other choice."
acura,rdx,2013,tnuzzi1, 02/22/2014,If I had known then what I know now,pos,"I have had my RDX for 1 year and 19,000 miles.
After the first few months of owning it i noticed a vibration between 2nd and 3rd gear and 4th and 5th gear.
I brought the car to the dealer and had a technician ride with me so I could point it out.
The vibration, the dealer stated, is due to the deactivation of cylinders and that it is minor with no fix.
This is not minor when you spend many hours driving.
A vehicle that is considered a ""luxury"" suv should not be vibrating.
The gas mileage is not as stated.
I average around 19mpg.
I drive about 50/50 highway/town.
The dealer replaced my bluetooth mic but that did not improve.
I can hear fine, people have a hard time understanding me.

As a follow up to this review.  I sold my RDX, couldn't stand it!
"
acura,rdx,2013,marky1020, 01/15/2013,Great well equipped SUV.,pos,"Have had it for 1 week now and so far, so good.
Drives exceptionally well and is more car-like then SUV like.
 Traded in a 10 year old Hyundai Santa Fe which I felt was a bit of a choppy ride.
Also had a Jeep Cherokee 15 some odd years ago which was totally truck like based on its 4x4 platform.
Of the 3, the Acura feels like driving a car while still having the benefits of riding higher, hauling more when needed and having AWD. Of course you can get AWD on some cars, but my feeling is that once you start driving an SUV, it's hard to go back into a car..not impossible, just hard."
acura,rdx,2013,plmrdx, 05/25/2013,BASE RDX IS EXCELLENT,pos,"The RDX is worth the $35-40K price compared to other luxury SUVs. The ride and performance of the 2013 model is excellent--see Consumer Reports. However, the Navigation Sys. is not worth the price. Unless you are an audiophile, the Tech Pkg. is not worth $4K. Buy it without, then get a good Garmin GPS of $100+. You will like it better.

acura,rdx,2013,eastbaysteve, 06/30/2012,Perfect at the price,pos,"I drive 30k per year and go through a lot of vehicles. Comfort, performance and reliability are all critical for me. This car covers all of them - best for the $ by far."
acura,rdx,2013,chips9509, 09/10/2012,Great 2nd Generation RDX,pos,"The V6 / 6 speed transmission in the new RDX is outstanding - quiet, smooth, fuel economy is very good, and it does not have to down shift on every hill. An excellant combination of power and fuel economy.
Had 3 passengers on road trip to football game and all commented on ride quality, and how quiet it was.
Considered other SUV's in this class, 2013 RX, GLK, and others. Some were a little larger, most had more useable space behind rear seats, but were also many $1000's more. If you want a Premium SUV of this size, dollar for dollar this was simply the best choice."
acura,rdx,2013,cohermit, 05/31/2012,Excellent Value!,pos,"Acura has put in alot of effort to make this thing fun to drive.
It has plenty of power to go fast or you can throttle down to conserve fuel.
I have fill up this car 4 tims and average over 25 MPG (from real calculation).
 I also own a honda pilot.
And I have to say this RDX's second row is just as spacious.
Aside from all the quality others already mentioned I feel this car is a great value.
I have cross shopped and test drove X3, Q5, XC60 and GLK.
Any of those car equiped to this package will be $7000 to $15000 over.
Some might have a frew extra features, but the bottom line to me is, does it beat Acura reliability?
 Always thoughtful accesories no other brand name car will offer."
acura,rdx,2013,spottedone, 07/10/2013,Good vehicle but lacking,pos,"I have had my RDX for over a year and 17000+ miles. Overall I like the car especially when I was averaging 23+ mpg. Over the last several month my mpg has dropped to 21, still not bad. I have had it to the delearship for a full synthetic oil change. I also had to pay for a front wheel alighment which was needed. I have upgraded my gas to Chevron on their advice but it has not made a difference.
I noticed that the 2014 MDX has the same mpg ratings and now has touch screen controls which I miss on my old Pioneer flat panel. I also agree that I do not feel like I am riding in a luxury car.
One serious problem which I took to the dealer was tire slippage when turning from a stop. "
acura,rdx,2013,riathediva627, 09/20/2012,The 2013 RDX is fantastic!!,pos,"Ride Quality: The RDX rides smoothly and has a car-like feel. It has a firm, but luxurious feel.

Performance: The engine has pickup. The engine sounds solid and pleasantly aggressive.

Interior:
The interior is luxurious, yet sporty. The leather is soft and of good quality. The interior is roomy-even for a tall person! The sound system is awesome! The backup camera has 3 views which ensures that you see stuff very well. The navigation system is very intuitive. The car sets itself based on the key in the car (ex. Driver 1 key shows all Driver 1's radio presets and adjust seats to Driver 1's presets). Windows are tinted nicely. The Hard Disc Drive that records CDs is great! Listening to music"
acura,rdx,2013,vegasmurano, 11/11/2013,Review update,pos,"After 8 months or so with my RDX AWD tech these are my thoughts.
My gas mileage stinks, I am averaging about 19 all around . But to be fair I live and work on Las Vegas BLVD and the traffic and amount of traffic lights are insane.
No storage for my jumper cables or any cubbies to hide stuff.
Gas tank way too small, needs another 2 or 3 gallons in size.
Navi works good but it takes 5 minutes to tell the navi what to do, and it does not understand street names and you need to repeat it 5 or 6 times quite often.
Cornering is no BMW but it is much smoother riding but still competent.
Acceleration is amazing, but it will empty your tank fast if you enjoy it."
acura,rdx,2013,Doug Sabo, 07/05/2018,2nd RDX I've owned,pos,"Overall a nice SUV, not too big but large enough to handle most of the things that come up when you own a house and have a lot of DIY projects.  It's a nice balance of something sporty yet an SUV.  It handles well for what it is, the V6 engine has plenty of power to handle itself in traffic while still being fun/sporty to drive.  I do wish it was a little quieter on the road and it really needs air vents in the backseat for passengers.  Overall a good blend of functionality and sport in a mid-size SUV.

Well after 3 plus years I recently traded it in on another RDX, 2016 this time. I drove everything under the sun from a ChevyvTahoe to an Audi S4, and an Audi Q5 to a Toyota Pathfinder to an Infiniti Q60 and ended up back with the RDX. Best combination I found of flirting to balance a mid-size SUV to something that's fun to drive short of spending almost twice as much on a Porsche Macan

I researched the Q5, X3, a quick look at the XC60, and briefly considered the RAV-4 V6. Glad I went with tech. The car was the best ""package"" for me - a great blend of performance, luxury, comfort, utility. For the most part (and I'm picky), it's got all the features I wanted in my next car, and it continues to impress me with the ride quality, power on delivery, fit and finish, interior quality, awesome sound system with the tech package. The ergonomics make sense to me, the size is roomy, but not big. Loving the gas mileage! I highly recommend it, and aim to keep it for many years. "

Prior to my Acura I had a Honda Accord V6, amazing car, then purchased a 2008 Lexus IS250 and what a nightmare!
Car was beautiful, eye catching, but at 30K engine oil rings and pistons needed to be replaced, car was burning oil, fortunately all covered by Lexus!
Once the car hit 100K and after several repairs it was time to unload and get back into a reliable Honda/Acura!
My next car will be an Acura again!
As I read reviews people complain about this attractive SUV, what most people don't see if the reliability of Acura's and overall value!"

 I'm not talking about potholes, I am talking about road bumps which has me questioning the suspension. Inside you hear the bump-bump bump-bump bump bump.
Or maybe I am missing the cabin accoustical material.

acura,rdx,2013,spottedone, 02/14/2013,Meets my expectations,pos,I have close to 11k miles on my RDX. I wanted an SUV that was fun to drive and yet got better gas mileage than my 2011 Highlander. I know I did not need the size of the MDX. I call my RDX my high performance sports car. The gas mileage has met my expectations. I mainly drive in the city and am averaging 23-24mpg. The only complaint I have is the tires losing traction while turning from a stop. This makes me wish I had opted for the AWD. I believe that the naviagtion system is too cumbersome having to press too many buttons. Further the car designers could have opted for more flair. The RDX is rather bland.
acura,rdx,2013,average_joe3, 07/24/2013,Lack Of Ride Comfort,neg,"They disregard the new car warranty. I bought a new RDX six months ago and it has 5,000 miles. This so called luxury vehicle bounces more than a Magic Mountain ride, even in flat surfaces. The service technician agreed that it has a rough ride, yet the dealer did not even put it in a hoist to check if the suspension is loose. I get a headache every tim I drive it. Acura customer service considers the rough ride to be normal."
acura,rdx,2013,traveldr, 07/09/2013,First Maintenance Visit,neu,"The RDX with a US News Car Rating of 8.5 was chosen over other vehicles with better US News Car Ratings, e.g., Subaru Outback 8.9, Lexus RX350 8.6, etc.
 Other vehicles had better Maintenance plans (60000 free maintenance on Outback) and better interest rates (0% vs. 1.9%)
First maintenance visit -- had to come back to dealer for replacement of damaged sensor wire -- physical inspection of part shows either misassemble or installation error by tool marks on part + I purchased road hazard insurance and was still charged $185.
Car pulls slightly to right after maintenance visit - tires rotated without trueing, rebalance or road check which any reputable tire dealer would hve done"
acura,rdx,2013,briansmi, 04/13/2014,"Extremely Comfortable, Storage Could Improve",pos,"I have owned my 2013 RDX for a year and a half and have 14,000 miles on it. This is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. On long trips I can be in the car for 4-5 hours and not be stiff.
The gas millage is very good for the size of the vehicle. The VCE goes from 6 to 3 on the freeway allowing for good millage on longer hauls. If I went 60-65, I could pull 29 MPG on standard hauls (no major mountains). City/Highway combo I get 22-24.
The biggest issue I have is the poor design of the storage space in the back. When you drop the rear seats they do not lie flat which greatly decreases your ability to load the back. It creates a slant upward which makes it difficult to stack items. Given the rest of how well the rest of the vehicle is laid out, I'm not sure why Acura engineers did such a bad job when considering how to get the most out of the back. I believe this vehicle is the smallest in square footage of storage and this is the primary reason why. 
*UPDATE I have had a problem with annoyingly squeaky brakes on this car in the past few months. Their is an Acura service bulletin telling dealers to replace the front pads to get rid of this. If you do a Google search you can find it. If you own one and your dealing with this take it to the dealer and have them replace the pads, should be free of charge.

acura,rdx,2013,RWD Fan, 06/19/2018,Buying Used but Confused? Buy This Car.,pos,"This was a great ""bridge"" car and I always thought it would be a perfect 1st car for a teen or a young family because of the built-in safety and test results.  I bought a not-so-gently used low-mileage 2013 with 29k miles - but those were hard miles on this car and it took a lot of detailing to get it back to where I was happy with it. So I can tell you that the interior is VERY durable.  The base ""pleather"" seats are super comfortable and extremely durable - truly some of the most comfortable seats I've ever had.  They were punished with sand and spills and I got them back to almost new with the exception of one lipstick-like stain.  The interior carpet took a lot of punishment from the 1st owner but cleaned up almost like new.  Well done, Acura.  Smooth-shifting and quiet with the base model technology that was an upgrade for me - I like being able to select ""talk to you later - I'm driving"" option as auto response to texts.  Sometimes couldn't understand my verbal requests. Acura's AC system isn't robust (a previous Acura had the same problem) and I see mention of that on message boards so it just must be an Acura thing. More of what I loved and why I bought it: durable, good horsepower/weight ratio for quick acceleration, easy exit/entry and the back seats are HUGE for this segment and I needed this to tote my elderly parents around and put their walkers in the back.  Much better MPG than my trade-in so that was a plus.  But I traded it because I drive 200 highway miles (1-way) very quickly back/forth to see the parents and it has a C-pillar blind spot that you can't adjust the mirrors outwardly far enough to address.  And the FWD dynamics are annoying to me when turning and accelerating from a stop.  I prefer RWD but I've had a few FWD cars over the years that didn't annoy me like this one did so that combined with the blind spot AND the lack of climate control vents for the backseat passengers (really? in 2013 you can't put vents back there?) I traded it for a very nice gently-used RWD sedan. But hey, it's a great trustworthy car for particular needs and since the 2013-2018 (?) models are virtually unchanged - go buy yourself a nice USED RDX for the price you like since you won't notice much difference between the model years.  Update after having traded it 12 months ago - I still kinda miss this used RDX and will test drive the newer version for future cars to see if the things that bothered me about this model have improved.  I still stand by my recommendation.

acura,rdx,2013,busyworkingmom, 08/25/2012,"Very pleased with my first Acura, love the 2013 RDX.",pos,"I spent a lot of time researching this auto purchase.
I needed a car that I can commute in but also travel up the Utah canyons for skiing and also, take on road trips.
The 2103 RDX was the perfect fit for me--size, features, price, gas mileage and reliability.
 

My neighbors have an earlier RDX and have little good to say but when I saw the reviews and the gas mileage on the 2013, I knew I had to drive it.
Very glad I did.
I was on the verge of purchasing another car--and the RDX quickly changed my mind. It's fast enough, the interior is well designed, it looks classic so it won't be completely dated in 10 years (I keep my cars a long time!) and I love all of the features. "

acura,rdx,2013,newro, 06/24/2014,Ho Hum,neu,"Just got rid of the Acura RDX and got and infinity QX50 with Navigation, loaded for $50 a month less than the Acura. The RDX in my mind was a Honda CRV, same tiny display that looked exactly like the Honda, the blue tooth was terrible (I came out of a TL) and it was a step backwards. The Infinity is more comfortable, better equipped and truth be told, while Acura is a step above others in a buying experience sense, the Infinity is in a class above, really first rate. I would have considered the MDX but it was way over priced. Sorry to leave Acura but honestly they have changed as a car company in my mind. The QX50 is a much better car as far as I am concerned.

Also the entry of data into this system takes impossibly long time. I have reverted to using Google maps. Voice activation- throw it out the window- does not understand a single command from someone with no accent at all. Loud interior on the road- you hear all road noise. Cant even hear people on the bluetooth on the highway because car is so loud. Bought this car brand new and wish I never drove it off the lot. My husband has 2008 TL and his GPS is more knowledgeable than mine. And, with only 30K miles on it, it already has a knock with all regular maintenance performed as scheduled. "

I walked away in April 2014, traded it for a BMW X3.
Performance: numb steering, terrible suspension (failed, under warranty), failed engine mounts producing excessive vibration, unstable at high speed. Tech package: mediocre with Atari graphics. Sunroof: constantly malfunctioning. Build quality: Terrible cheap plastic all over, exposed sound attenuating foam where the windshield meets the dash, no rear passenger vents, the poorest quality leather i've ever seen in a car, and NO dash cover under steering column (where you can feel wiring and more sound attenuating foam), Playskool key FOB, hollow doors.

Was a little nervous that they moved to electric power steering and took away the SH-AWD, but this car is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the outgoing 2012 model.
The handling is precise and the ride is fantastic....a great balance.
Fuel Economy on premium has been 23-25 MPG's on mixed city/highway use,FWD model.
Pretty stellar for such a powerful 3.5 V-6.
Overall, a fantastic vehicle.
 Even though some key features are missing (will explain later), you CANNOT get any car in this price class with this amount of standard equipment.
 Test drove BMW X3, Mercedes GLK and Audi Q5, and neither has the ride quality/handling balance that this car has, AND for thousands less"

We purchased our 2013 RDX FWD with Tech Package today.
MSRP is $38,020 + Destination Fee of $895 = $38,915. The invoice price to the dealer is $36,665. The inventory on these 2013 models has not built up at the dealers yet, so some dealers are not come down on the prices, but if you are persistent you can get it for much cheaper than the MSRP list prices.
I have been in contact with 8 different dealers all over Northern California via email and phone.
We ended up buying it from the dealer in our home town for $37,000 + Tax & Lic.

acura,rdx,2013,vjd2211, 10/30/2013,Tech package not worth it,pos,"Nice, elegant car but looks like suffering from cost-cutting. At 3k miles battery went (luxury car with low cost battery) - the GPS needs redesign, it looks and feels obsolete and the voice recognition does not work well - Bluetooth low voice quality.
Ride excellent - engine, tranny ok after 8k miles."
acura,rdx,2013,dorse, 06/03/2012,Basque Red Base,pos,"Very pleased to find this much power with good gas mileage.
Quality is excellent and the car looks great - I especially like the basque red.
The cylinder deactivation system is flawless - you can only tell when it is in use by watching the digital bar graph for mileage jump from 20 to 30+.
Initial impressions on gas mileage are 19-20 in pure city and 27-28 for all highway.
May get a bit better with more miles on it.
Car is too new to evaluate reliability - I gave it a 5 since my 98 acura integra has 212k miles on it and has been reliable."
acura,rdx,2013,Dean, 02/07/2017,Don't buy,neg,"The only thing that this vehicle has going for it is the exterior design. Rear shocks thump, engine vibrates, and the worse is the VCM. Many have had issues with this problem, but Acura refuses to do anything about it. Just look at resale values and you will see they don't hold their value because of this. For the price, this doesn't come close to being a luxury vehicle. My 2004 Lexus RX330 runs and drives better.

I have had Acura's since 1996 and the one that I just traded, a 2010 TL had a blue tooth that was lots better. Cannot speak a phone number unless it is tagged, makes no sense, especially when you only get 15 tags. Giant step backwards on that one. Car is very good in the snow/rain. Have never driven a Lexus or BMW X3 but I would have to say that this Acura seems perfectly fine with typically Acura build quality"
acura,rdx,2013,christopher, 01/26/2018,POOR SERVICE. Electrical drain undiagnosed,neg,"Replaced the battery after 3 years.  Seemed soon, but can happen.  After new battery, car keeps dying as battery is draining.  Dealer looked at it and told me I needed new battery cables for a mere $600.  My personal mechanic inspected them and said they were fine.  Car kept dying.  Dealer told me I needed the new cables again - so I did it.  Two days later the car is dead and won't start.  I have it towed to the dealership where they spend 3 hours determining that the Stereo Amplifier was the problem and had a huge draw on the battery.  That cost me $300 just to receive that news and for an additional $1100 I could get that amplifier replaced.  The amplifier - although only $230 at the Acura Parts Store - is located right beneath the cup holder.  Apparently, some ""liquid"" spilled through the cup holder onto the amplifier.  WHY ARE THERE ELECTRONICS located beneath a cup holder?  I submitted a request on Acura's site to talk to someone at Acura.  Three weeks later I received a call from Acura to remind me that I'm a year past my warrantee.  I wasn't even asking for them to do anything.  I just wanted to know if my experience was common or atypical.  VERY DISAPPOINTED Acura!!  I took 2 years researching cars and landed on my 2013 RDX and loved it initially.  Now I'm just disappointed.

Although I was not crazy about the styling, the car flew, handled well and the interior had a style to it. I have had the RDX for about 2 weeks now and the over riding feeling that I get is that it looks and feels cheap inside. Plastic all the way through, even the sun visors feel thin. The blue tooth is a giant step backwards from what I had in the TL, it makes zero sense. I got this car for my wife to negotiate the snow in the NE because the TL was not very good. I looked at the Murano and honestly, it is a nicer car inside. "
acura,rdx,2013,aidano2, 03/26/2013,Very good initial impressions,pos,"It's comfortable, fast, and has a good amount of room in the front and rear. Also has nice simple, but solid, cabin features. It's very good in pretty much every area -- which almost makes it feel a little boring to talk about."
acura,rdx,2013,dca2013, 09/27/2012,Shop around before buying,neg,"I've had my RDX for about three weeks and I agree with what most folks have said about the features and ride. But I was very surprised to find that the sunroof would not close. It kept stopping half way. I had to reach up pull down the wind relector to get it to finally close. There is just no excuse for this.

I had a few accessories added which so far may not have been worth it. The roof rack has a very poor fit and finish, of course that could be to the way the dealer installed it.

The cargo cover is just a bad design. It retracts like a window shade, with a hard piece that just hangs free - makes access
a problem. And even though this is a small issue, there should be no issue."

Pre-2013

1.

2. Say name

2013 (per manual)

1.

Wait for beep, and Press Voice Command
4.
Say name.
5.
Wait for system to repeat name back and beep.
6.
Press Voice Command
7. Say ""Dial.""

Reading other reviews seems like I am driving a different car and I'd like to share my view to help future buyers understand what they are buying. In one sentence: Acura does not belong to the club of Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes, do not compare RDX to Q5, X3 and do not read reviews that attempt to do so. 

Main complain: whoever designed this car never drove in it. I've bought top of the line model and it is missing basic features that come free in Toyota."

If considering this car make sure to take an extended test drive and check to make sure the features you normally expect are there.
I have owned over 50 autos and this is the worst mistake I've made since the Oldsmobile diesel.
Ride is fine on highway if you don't encounter pot holes, small bumps or rough pavement.
Even crawling over a speed bump makes the front suspension sound as if it's coming apart.
Embarrassing if you have passengers as they will think something is broken.
The front passenger seat has no ""up"" adjustment.

I am very concerned about the long term durability of this car - which is the main reason I bought it. Can't wait to trade out."
acura,rdx,2013,Friendly Travel Agent, 12/03/2020,Great before 100k,pos,"We bought the car back when it was first released back in 2012. The RDX was reliable, accelerated well, had plenty of technological advancements, and had great storage space. However, the gas mileage averaged about 20-22mpg, even on the highway, which we primarily used it for. After 100k miles, we noticed that the car would get progressively more expensive to operate. The maintenance bills from the dealership became progressively more expensive, as parts had to be replaced. Perhaps we could have gone for something cheaper at an independent mechanic, or maybe a different dealership would have given us different service. Nevertheless, the overall cost of the vehicle grew to be impractical, especially for something only 7 years old. We sold it in 2019 for a Tesla Model 3, and gave it to CarMax for a $14k appraisal. Would I recommend this as a used car, given the price point? Not particularly, unless you have a plan for keeping costs low. It's a well performing car. It's very safe, and has a nice amount of technology, even for today. However, the fuel costs and the maintenance costs may not be worth spending.  
"
acura,rdx,2014,jh16, 04/23/2014,A great choice - extreamly safe in an accident,pos,"I have had my 2014 RDX AWD tech for about a week now.
So far I have been very happy with the car.
It drives smooth, brakes well, and the transmission seems to work flawlessly.
I am most happy with the turning radius, as my last two vehicles were monsters to turn and try to park.
I also looked at the Q5, and besides the Audi being more expensive, I did not like the idea of the turbo 4 cyl engine.
I've driven an audi with a turbo before, and it seemed very inconsistent - thats something that I did not want to deal with again.

The RDX has great acceleration (and sounds pretty good too when you step on it), its too bad they hid the dual exhaust tips up under the rear bumper.
 
**Update - I totaled this car about 4 months after I bought it.  I was driving in the freeway, traveling up a grade where a car was stalled in the middle lane with no battery to power its lights.  I smashed into the back of it going around 55-60mph, that was a shock!  My passenger and I were able to crawl out of the car, more or less uninjured with just a few air bad burns on wrist / face.  We, as well as my family, were very impressed with the safety of the car.  I plan on buying another sometime in the future.

acura,rdx,2014,familyguy1, 04/01/2014,2014 RDX - Comfortable but a vibration issue ruins the fun,pos,"Purchased in late Dec 2013 and after 3 months and 3,000 miles, here's my review: 

Ride is comfortable, agility is great, suspension is fairly stiff.
Seats are supportive and comfortable (both front and rear). Sound system is great.
 

BUT... The car has a vibration issue from about 60 MPH on up.
Had the tires spin balanced, road force balanced, the prop shaft replaced... still there.
The vibration is not severe, but it's ever present and on long trips, leaves your feet tingling a bit and ready to get out.
Very annoying.

Rode with the dealer service tech, he feels it too, but says that's as good as it gets. 

Because of the vibration, feels like I made a $38,000 mistake."
acura,rdx,2014,zoomacura, 08/20/2013,Downsized from MDX,pos,"I just downsized from a 2011 MDX to 2014 RDX AWD and am happy with my choice. Getting about 27mpg in RDX vs. 19mpg in MDX. A little disappointed about losing SH-AWD but a good trade off for fuel economy. New RDX looks sharper and feels roomier than its predecessor (my brother has the older model), handles corners nicely, quiet and luxurious interior, and new keyless ignition start is a plus that wasn't available in the 2011 MDX. My biggest and perhaps only complaint is that the E-break is too close to my leg! Smashed my shin into it about three times in the past three weeks that I've driven this car. Overall, a spritely and spirited vehicle."
acura,rdx,2014,patrick28212, 07/17/2013,Balanced and competent vehicle!,pos,"I purchased my 2014 Acura RDX about three weeks ago and I love it! I traded my 2006 BMW 530xi for this vehicle because the maintence costs were really adding up for me. I was looking for reliability and performance and this car has both! It accelerates well and provides great comfort. The size allows for passengers to be pampered without wasted space or bulk. Mileage is reasonable for this type of vehicle (20-22 in mostly city driving and 26 hwy at 75-80 mph). The car is a good value based on content and performance. 

Updat7/2016: Still love my RDX! Not loving the tread life of my stock Michellin tires. 38,000 and they might not make it to 40k. Otherwise all is good. Would buy one again.

Update 7/2017: RDX is a champ! Hard to match the value of this vehicle. No unusual repairs. Still looks new. Performs well. Very good on snow/ice.

acura,rdx,2014,ride50, 07/29/2013,Acura got it right this time,pos,"Test drove BMW X3, Lexus RX300 and Audi Q5 2.0. I can say the RDX was a winner hands down. Powerfull engine, luxurious interior, quiet, smooth and comfortable ride, excellent navigation. All that for at least 10k less than other 3 brands. I liked the Acura's straight forward pricing. FWD or AWD with technology package or without it. BMW, Lexus and Audi starts at the similar base, but by the time you ad few essential option packages, the price skyrockets to 50k. Audi tries to make you believe that their's is the only luxury SUV, so you should not even think to pay below the sticker price. what a joke. The Acura RDX comes fully loaded, no confusing packages and pricing. Very pleased."
acura,rdx,2014,Ben Camposano, 02/15/2016,2 years later...,neu,"I purchased this 2014 RDX AWD Base. Doing comparisons with the CR-V, RAV4, and a Forester XT, RDX had the most bang for the buck as you'd have to load up the former cars in order to match the RDX, but with less power and ride quality. But it wasn't all paradise for me when I had 4 instances of transmission slippage during Jan. 2016. Long-story short, the transmission had to be replaced due to the problem actually happening to the mechanic when he test-drove the vehicle. Also, Reno Acura did their due diligence by also warranty-replacing the rear shocks due to thumping noise that comes from the rear. Now, I bought this car since I heard/read so many reviews of their reliability. As a working student, I need this car to get me through a 1.5-hour round-trip commute to the university, and was quite disappointed to learn of the defects. Repairs aside, I'm now questioning my decision to purchase this vehicle. I'm hoping that it'll get me through college before things really fall apart, and then trade it in promptly. 

For any of you experiencing problems, do your due diligence by documenting the problem.

acura,rdx,2014,OC Mike, 03/08/2018,Ocean City Happy,pos,"I think this is, by far, the best value in luxury SUVs.  I love my Acura RDX!  I have owned it for approximately thirteen months.  Great acceleration, nice handling, comfortable ride, decent sound system, great leather, sporty exterior, beautiful interior with easy to understand controls.  Two pet peeves... the front end could be a little tighter and the trans can have some hard shifts.  Not major problems, just a comparison to other vehicles I have owned in the past.  Perfect size and great safety ratings.  My car insurance premium decreased $90/year after purchasing and replacing a lesser valued car.  Good gas mileage.  After one year of ownership, I'm still very happy with my decision to purchase the RDX and would consider purchasing another one in the future.  That said, I only put about 12,000 miles on the car a year, so it could be a while.  Good for at least 150K miles.  **** Update as of 10/19 (21 months of ownership), I still love this vehicle.  At 42,000 miles.  Just had car serviced.... No problems.  **** Updated 3/20, not much has changed at 46,000 miles.  This is just a great vehicle.  I highly recommend the RDX.

Low right seat position mandated by feds stupid regs. No brake noise, no chemical odor, no problem with bluetooth, no tranny noise, etc, etc.. Was skeptical of lack of rear AC vents. Florida resident with only AC complaint from rear seat being 'it's too cold back here'.   Only down side is NOT fault of car or Acura.

Good storage in front cabin 

Minuses:
Q5 feels more solid and is more fun to drive
RDX has choppy rear suspension
Interior materials are okay but not what you might expect in a luxury vehicle
Noticeable road noise, especially on uneven pavement"
acura,rdx,2014,Vern Boyce, 04/15/2016,Too many front suspension problems!,pos,"We've owned Honda vehicles for over 20 years. MOST impressed with every one - with the exception of our RDX. We absolutely loved the car when we first saw it on the dealership lot. Never having had any major issues with the previous Honda vehicles we've owned(2 Accords and 3 CRV's), we thought we'd add a ""touch of class"" in vehicle ownership. We purchased our RDX about 2 and a half years ago, and now have doubts in our decision. MOST disappointed in that we have had one issue and then another. Our most serious complaints are that with the front end suspension!! As mentioned, in a little over 2 years, we just had our third front end strut replaced. And trust me, being a senior citizen and ex-police officer, we're NOT ones to abuse our vehicles in any way nor neglect what need be. 

As I say, other than that, it's a Honda. We love the handling, style, economy and performance. The last time we brought our RDX in for strut replacement, the dealership shared our views on our frustration and disappointment, but sadly, that's the way it goes sometimes. Therefore, now that we have our car back home and cleaned up, we'll be trading it in - for a Buick. No longer bothering with Honda. Again, it's too bad for us as we have thoroughly enjoyed MANY Honda cars and other Honda-made products(Honda Shadow motorcycle, boat motor and two 4-wheelers) but will no longer deal with the company. Calling customer satisfaction made NO difference - other than ""lending an ear"". Oh well, that's the way it goes sometimes.......

acura,rdx,2014,retired01, 08/23/2013,"Great car, Tech package a disapointment",pos,"In my opinion, the RDX is as capable as a 5-passenger SUV can get. Drivetrain is outstanding, ride and handling are very good, but if you want GPS, get a Garmin. You'll save money and prevent road rage. The tech package is designed to eliminate use, except by driver's voice, if the vehicle is in motion. This prevents use by the passenger/co-pilot unless the driver is told to ""say OK"", ""say two"", ""say next"", etc. and the voice recognition has difficulty with my voice. I say ""two"", it gives me a list of nearby ""schools"". If you frequently are a vacationing couple, save your marriage, skip the tech package."
acura,rdx,2014,todd_d, 01/25/2015,Huge disappointment,neg,"After having nothing but great experiences with our last 5 hondas, the Acura RDX was a complete disappointment. Above 60 on smooth highway, its a pretty good ride. But around town in the sub 45 range, it is horrible! Within 3 months of owning it, we had all of the struts replaced under warranty. This made no difference. I don't understand this since it is basically a CRV chassis and the CRV rides quite a bit better. I thought maybe something was wrong with this particular one, but after reading other peoples experiences on Acurazine, this is the norm. Not just with RDX, but all Acura models at this time. 1st Acura I've owned, and last! Traded it in after 14 months, 12000 miles. "
acura,rdx,2014,mountainbob, 08/08/2014,Brake Safety Issue,neg,"This problem would not be fixed by Acura.  It got so bad I sold the car for a loss, but at least I am safe. 
Mine and all 2014 models have a front end metal on metal clang going over bumps.
Diagnosed by two dealers as brake pad metal backing hitting caliper clips.
Acura will not fix, dealer has made a temporary fix. Dealers are frustrated with Acura over issue. Dealer says he does not know if this is a safety issue.
Filed complaint with Federal safety commission. Metal on metal will eventually break down.
Acura will have to fix the problem if more owners complain to dealers. This is a potential dangerous brake issue.
The clang is not something that a so called ""high end"" SUV should have. Acura calls it, ""a Characteristic"" of the model. If this is so then lower the price to a low end SUV.

It replaced a 2010 TSX V6.
I find the RDX to be everything the TSX was in performance and handles even better.
(The V6 TSX was front end heavy.).
I have been very pleased with the gas consumption averaging 27.5 MPG with mostly highway driving.
Anyone looking for a mid size SUV should take a close look at this car.
The base trim matches many of the other models luxury trim which makes it very price competitive with models you wouldn't expect."
acura,rdx,2014,troyruttman, 06/04/2013,How to Make a Car,pos,"The RDX does everything a car is supposed to do -- it's comfortable, fun to drive, pampers you a little and makes financial sense. It's less expensive than its
competitors but drives as well or better. The combo of auto and manual transmission is practical and fun. Manual downshifting on mountain roads saves on brake wear -- and with cylinder deactivation mpg can jump suddenly from 20 to 30 or even 40 with no change in sound or feel. Bluetooth and USB audio work beautifully. Seats are very comfortable and storage space is good. I upgraded from a Honda and the family resemblance is clear. This company makes high quality cars for those who wish to balance comfort, convenience and value. "
acura,rdx,2014,mp, 08/03/2015,farm wife's truck,pos,"THis car is one of the best I have driven.  I have had Mercedes, and Lexus.  My Acura is s mudder, and a snow machine.  It is convenient to haul everything from grain to kids.  The awd is super, and handles all weather.  Also is a nice dress up car for church.
One thing...........terrible connections for my iphone.  You have to have a flashlight to find the charger.
I would buy another rdx.
"
acura,rdx,2014,tramm, 12/19/2013,Continue to be Disappointed,neu,"The RDX replaced my 2011 Q5. I bought it because it had more standard features than a Q5, was $5000 less than a Q5 and positive reviews. It is a good car in many respects but the suspension, interior quality and road noise reduction are less that what you expect from a ""luxury class"" SUV. The vehicle now has about 36K miles and the dealer has had to replace the rear struts twice and fix an annoying drive train vibration. I also replaced the brakes and rotors at 24K miles at my cost - Acura said brakes were not covered by warranty even with relatively low mileage. The repair shop said the rotors were warped and this should not happen in any vehicle with only 24K miles.

The base comes with a long list of standard equipment including bluetooth,xm, backup cam, heated leather and sunroof- options packages on most competitors. Upon entry it sets the seat and mirrors to your settings. Pulling out, the strong engine and smooth, fast transmission make you feel confident in any traffic situation. The brakes are fully capable. We have averaged about 23 MPG in mixed driving. The cylinder deactivation takes a little getting used to, but helps in   
efficiency. The interior features are logically laid out and work flawlessly. Very

- is the steering wheel extra small?
I am extremely disappointed with the technology of the vehicle - even after purchasing the technology package.
Big rip off.
 the GPS is the same hard to use out dated GPS they have been installing since 2004.
Hello Acura!!
Has anyone there ever used an iPhone?!.
You can't use the steering wheel controls to activate Siri.
You can upload your songs to the hard drive but it's just a big list of music files - you really can't select songs or artist.
Very disappointing."
acura,rdx,2014,kelley shimo, 06/21/2017,Disappointing workmanship and UI design,neg,"Cheap paint used on the vehicle.  Chips and scratches very easily.  Door dings and scratches go all the way to the metal.  I had a Mercedes ML320 for 19 years and did not have this many chips and scratches.

The interior placements of the air vents are ludicrous.  The air flow (summertime) from the driver's vent is unable to reach me because it is blocked by the steering wheel base and the signal/wipers levers.   I don't see how this design flaw was not noticed by Acura. I need the heat or the cool air directed toward me not my steering wheel and hands   The heat temp (winter) is slow to reach 80 degrees and needs to be at full blast to warm the front seats.  In 51 degree weather, it takes a good 10 minutes for the heater to work.  Heater set at 75-80 degrees and cool air comes out of the vents. During the summer, the AC has be cranked full blast to reach a comfortable 72 degrees. 
These annoyances make my daily hour commute to work even worse.
"
acura,rdx,2014,Melissa P., 01/03/2018,Good not-quite-ready-for-mom-van option,pos,"I was purposely looking for something more compact for our small (one kid) family, as I prefer that to driving a larger SUV. I traded in a two-year-old TSX, which I loved, to buy the RDX so we would have more rear leg room and cargo space. I like the simplicity of buying an Acura -- get it with or without bells and whistles, no nonsense. Good value for the money. All the goodies I wanted at the time, heated seats, XM radio, etc. While previous years had a turbocharged engine, this one does not which means pretty decent gas mileage. My daily commute is a combination of city/country road driving and I hit the mid 20's most tanks. There is a bit more road noise than I remember with my TSX. And make no mistake this is definitely a smaller car. Another kid or a large dog, and you might want to consider something larger. We fill up the cargo area pretty quickly! But I do still feel that the rear legroom is better than that of other cars in this size class, and installing the car seat with LATCH is a snap. The car has been extremely reliable with no visits to service other than regularly scheduled ones.

acura,rdx,2014,newro, 12/31/2013,OK but.....,pos,"Have had Acura's since 1998, always a TL. My wife needed an all wheel/4 wheel drive that was not huge so we got out of a 2010 TL and into a 2013 RDX without the tech package.
Its nice, but its not going to blow you away. As with all of my previous Acura's, its a quality build and reliable. Quick enough but I find it a little herky jerky in the steering, but, I have a 2010 Pathfinder which is like a tank compared to the RDX. It is pretty good in the snow, which is why we got it so I suppose that all in all, it does what its supposed to. It shares a radio with the Honda CRX and from what I am told, the all wheel drive platform as well. I guess its the Acura version of the CRX."
acura,rdx,2014,padgett01, 09/14/2019,RDX AWD,pos,"This car finally stopped or revolving negative equity and big repairs.  Cost to own was very good and I was surprised at the value for regular maintenance at the dealer for tires, transaxle, brakes, etc.  My wife still likes driving this car after 150k miles in 5-years, but we need to get into a new car in-time to pay-off before our son drives and needs a car (so we don't need to drive him everywhere)... Looking to take the next step into an MDX since this RDX was so good.  Oh yeah, AWD is great in the snow (we live in NE ohio snow belt) and when I drive I have to watch speed as this thing has giddy-up, even at 150k.

To add insult to injury many features that should be standard are only available on the tech model - fog lamps, power lift gate, ....

I always felt that a root canal was preferable
than shopping for a new car.

 The salesman I was put in contact with, Kevin, knew his product, easily explained the car's features and then stepped back to let the car sell itself. 

During the next few weeks I found myself back on the sales floor several times to ask Kevin questions about some of technological features. That's when I found Kevin to be as accommodating after the sale as he had been before. "

My extended family has had good experiences with Hondas, but poor ones with BMW and Mercedes. 

The RDX quickly became my favorite. Didn't like the CVT and driving exp. of the Outback although it had more space. The Crosstour was felt heavier and had worse maneuverability, although real 4x4. The RDX was an instant top choice on the test drive. I like that it's fast and agile when I need it to be and saves some fuel with the VCM tech. on the highway.

The tech. package has a lot of things I don't need, but the stock AWD has some great features."

My complaints would be no heat/air conditioning vent in the rear my former non luxury car had this. 
The mirrors hang out far on the sides really hard to get in my garage. I wish the temperature gage read larger. Overall a great purchase and my insurance did not go up. The RDX has a good safety rating."

Price: Best luxury SUV for this price. I would say very less when compare to other compact luxury SUV with given options

Options: I dont want to blame that few options (like blind spot monitor) are available since i know it before buying.

But the Bluetooth connectivity for phone is very poor. When i am using bluetooth calling, the audio is very poor and other end, they hear lot of noise (like wind blow sound). I have 2012 Camry but the bluetooth phone connection is very nice.

Overall: I am very much satisfied for the price. I love my car. You can get lot of standard features in base model."
acura,rdx,2015,broka, 07/25/2014,Sometimes it is the small stuff that counts,pos,"I picked up my new RDX with technology package 5 days ago and I LOVE DRIVING IT. But there are some stupid things that should be in a car of this class.
1) The front passenger seat does not go up causing discomfort for some people and makes them feel like they are sitting on the floor.
2) There is no air conditioning vent in the rear. If it can be in smaller and less expensive cars, I see no reason why this can only have the cut out for it.
3) There is no light in the luggage compartment. That is ridiculous.

Aside from these ""small"" issues, I love the car but these little annoyances can and should be easily fixed.


Update, I have had the car now 2 1/2 years and it has 36000 miles. The car ride and performs fantastic. The seats are extremely comfortable (except the passenger seat only goes forward and back and my wife needs to sit on a pillow). I did subsequently to the original writing of this review find a light in the rear tailgate but those other annoyances still exist and are still frustrating. However in the 2016 model each of them were fixed. The car comes off lease in 6 months and I honestly do not know what I am going to do. The 2017 model is essentially the same with a few updates and fixes to the annoyances and there is a piece of me that wants something different. But on the other hand, I cannot find any fault with the car or the service of the dealership. I have spent $0 in repairs and have only changed oil and rotated tires. It performs flawlessly on the road and is a joy to drive. Tough decision!
"
acura,rdx,2015,George L, 02/04/2016,A conundrum.,pos,"First, this is an excellent car. 
Having said that, after driving the car for six months, there are a number of short comings.
Now after 5 years, these comments are still applicable. Specifically
The first is that the rear seat does not fold flat when turned down. This makes it more difficult to store stuff
Second, I would have preferred a heated steering wheel (OK, I want to be pampered)
Third the gas mileage is a bit disappointing, particularly considering that premium fuel is required
Next, the transmission down shifting as one slows down at a stop light is ragged and noticeable.
The GPS system is a bit cumbersome, and cannot be used while driving. The phone system is also a fight to use while driving. I end up calling on my phone and letting the  system transfer it to the car's system. Translated the speak while driving system is a failure 
Parts of the technology are still difficult to use, and not quite intuitive. 
Voice recognition system is at best crummy
I still think the voice recognition system is lousy and the phone system is difficult to use. In my opinion, these electronics are the worst feature 
The dealer claims that the new models are better. (Expect that from a sales person)
The seat is a bit uncomfortable. I have tried various cushions, and positions. For long distance driving, the most effectve method for me is to stop and stretch my legs. 
Drive is a bit more sporty than I would like. The MDX has a better system that lets you select 'sporty' or 'luxury'
(The MDX costs $10,000 more, and is 10"" longer. To me again, a bit pricey)
One of the reasons that I purchased the car is the dealer. 
Our local dealer is absolutely terrific, and makes up for some of what I perceive as the short commings of the vehicle
I would have preferred more storage cubby holes.
Ergonomics are average.  Every time I get in the car, I have to be careful not to hit my head on the top of the door frame
Acceleration is excellent (obviously this is an offset for the mileage)
Seats are marginally comfortable, particularly on long rides.
Stereo is good
I enjoy the ride,again, the seat is a bit uncomfortable for long trips
Every car is a compromise, and there are no perfect grades
Despite my negative comments, the car, overall, is pretty good.
I have particularly good things to say about the reliability and dealer
The all wheel drive and convenient size is a very big draw for me; it seamlessly handles wet, icy and snowy conditions, and is easy to park in the city
This is a very nice car, but is also a work in progress
After a year, I can say I really enjoy the ride, except for the seat on long rides
The only gripe I really have are the Takata air bags. This is under recall (as are several million other cars,) but nobody has any replacements. I have been waiting for over three months, but the manufacturer has not been able to supply them.  Finally did, after a year
"
acura,rdx,2015,Jonradus, 10/03/2015,Worth the Money,pos,"This car gets mpg as advertised. I do mostly highway/suburbia driving and I'm at 26 mpg. You can get 30 mpg with all highway if you're light on the gas. 

I read some suspension complaints, and I understand why they're here. The back axle is pretty rigid and clunks over rough bumps. It's the only real problem with the car I've seen so far, but it's tolerable. 

The car handles great and has a smooth, linear power delivery with more than adequate acceleration. The  transmission also shifts smoothly. The steering is a bit loose at slow speeds, but picks up heft with speed.

Overall, this is a great car for the money.

acura,rdx,2015,CaBob, 05/02/2018,Almost a 5 star vehicle.,pos,"It's a comfortable, reliable car that's a decent buy for the money. Main complaint is with the air conditioning. In hot weather when in heavy traffic it cycles on and off in an effort to improve gas mileage. Air will actually blow very warm even with A/C setting at lowest possible spot. An instant read thermometer ranged up to 75 degrees blowing out of the vents at such time. The dash board lighting of the information control panel needs to be brighter. When wearing Polarized sun glasses in bright sunlight it's almost impossible to read the panel. Otherwise it's really a solid vehicle. Rides well, good acceleration and handling once you get rid of the factory installed tires and put some on that have some grip to them. Good visibility. No ongoing repair issues. Good customer service.

acura,rdx,2015,colonelken1, 02/07/2015,RDX---first 3 months,pos,"After getting a great deal on the base RDX using a buyers service, I'm pleased.  Not thrilled but pleased with my first SUV.  Sitting higher is a benefit with so many larger trucks and SUVs already on the road.  I've used the RDX around town and on one long trip.  Very comfortable seats on the trip for both driver and passenger.   Lots of legroom and headroom.  The rear seats fold but its a small SUV so don't expect to move beaucoup things.  

Wish it had come with a few tech package features like automatic rear tailgate opener/closer, xenon lights, and more blindside detection but it gets great safety ratings.  Nobody uses NAV systems anymore so I'm not paying another $3k.  Solid B+.  "
acura,rdx,2015,Nick, 12/17/2015,Significantly Less Value Than Expected,neg,"First off; the technology package is a waste of money and a sad trick Acura has played on buyers. The NAV system is near worthless when programming at a standstill, it is completely worthless once you are moving down the road and the ""Technology Package"" takes you into voice mode.  The voice mode makes you spell out destinations one letter at a time and then, for each letter, goes through a long (10 second) dialog on how to choose the next letter (?). This is really a poor joke on the consumer. The voice recognition system operates with about a 50% accuracy and by the time you get the address entered, you have spent your entire trip arguing with the ""Technology Package"". Simple fix; purchase a $100 Garmin and put it in front of the useless NAV screen. The road noise, harshness, and vibration is horrible; the Honda CR-V has a much improved ride over the more expensive Acura. Handling; the body roll is annoying and feels downright unstable on twisty roads. Fuel economy, throttle response, and acceleration are dismal on the ""Multi-Point/Low Pressure Fuel Injection"" compared to ""Direct Injection"" engines found on other similar and lower priced vehicles of the same vintage and category. The controls and displays are awkward at best and are not at all intuitive. Compared to earlier model Acura vehicles, these ""technology"" systems have taken a huge step backward.  Oh, unlike the cheap Honda CR-V base model, this Acura does not include a rear cargo area floor mat.  Imagine that! 

What can I say about the car that I like... it looks good, the leather feels nice, everything works (albeit it's a new car).

I've been a Honda customer over the past 10 years, Honda makes a solid no-frills, trouble free, turn key vehicle. This was my first Acura and this will be my last Acura unless Acura gets serious about building a car to help a driver get from one place to another efficiently, easily, and with minimal frustration.  Thank God I only took out a 3 year lease on this buggy; I'll be happy to hand the keys back and tell the dealer they can find another Acura customer. 

Make sure to test drive this vehicle thoroughly (like for several hours and over bumpy twisty roads) before signing on the dotted line.

Update as of May 18th, 2016:  This vehicle has been recalled for a faulty SRS (air bag). We received a notification, the dealer told is not to drive the vehicle until parts arrive, which are expected late summer 2016. We have been provided rental vehicles by the dealer, not Acura vehicles mind you, but typical rental vehicles. Dealer told me that I should feel blessed that they are doing anything at all. My point:  $425 a month for a bottom of the line Hyundai Santa Fe?  At this point, my mind is made up; no more Honda/Acura vehicles. Once off lease, I'll be looking elsewhere. You should consider this when making your choice on your next vehicle.

acura,rdx,2015,JP, 11/08/2017,Acura RDX - almost there !,pos,"Wife is completely satisfied with the RDX.  We agree on several areas for improvement.   2015 does not have vents in the console or overhead, directing heat or cool air to the rear seat passengers.  Bright trim on the console can reflect sun into drivers or passengers eyes.  Dislike the manufacturer not covering Navigation updates while vehicle is within it's warranty period.  Vehicle chassis/ suspension transmits shocks from road surface imperfections into the passenger compartment.   As with all SUV's, fuel economy is poor compared to station wagons, or hatchbacks which generally provide sufficient utility.   Unfortunately, US drivers have few choices when modest utility and sedan like fuel economy are desired.

acura,rdx,2015,ak07, 01/02/2015,"It's great, but...",pos,"After driving the 2015 RDX AWD for 5 months, I am happy about the car, but not thrilled for sure. It has excellent space compared to competitors and my family loves the leg space in rear seat. Great looking interior and decent mileage for a 3.5L V6 AWD. 
I was confused whether to take the tech option or not and at the end I decided to save 3.5K, which Acura was charging for the package. But now I feel I should have taken it, as the basic model miss some 'basic' features that we expect in a luxury car. Like the power tailgate, halogen lamps and fog lamps. Acura should not be selling any car without these. Its a little annoying when Honda sells Accord with more features that Acura RDX..!"
acura,rdx,2015,ML, 11/23/2015,Nice ride,pos,"Reliability of a Honda, better interior, really a great ride.  The reliability of the Audi and Volvo scared me away.  The twin turbo/supercharged engines will obviously have thier issues in time, so this feels like the right choice.

However, the BMW, cruises on the open road a bit nicer.  This starts pushing the rpm's at about 80, while the bmw will cruise up to 100 without breaking  a sweat.  There are  minor advantages to each.  Overall, I went with the reliability of the Honda brand.  At 23K miles, it has been a great decision.

Updating; at 30k miles, it is a great ride.  Perfect car for where we live and our needs.  Better car than the MDX which has better reviews,  the Lexus has no visibility and lame Toyota performance, and the Audi and Porsche will be in the shop another month before you can use them again.  Hyundai and Subaru are dangerously underpowered.  This is the easy winner.  Best car on the road imo.

acura,rdx,2015,Car guy, 07/19/2015,Buyer beware - horrible suspension,neg,"I had a 2015 RDX AWD (non-tech package) for a year. Bottom the rear suspension on the RDX is horrible.  Whenever you drive over the smallest bump on the road the rear suspension ""clunks"" and transmits the impact directly to the occupants. There's nothing wrong with the car (I had the dealer check) basically it's just poor suspension design. Unfortunately when I test drove the car it was on smooth recently paved roads - big mistake.  Search any of the Acura owner/community sites and you'll see plenty of similar comments about the 2013 to present RDX and the same issue with 2014 - present MDX and TLX. There are other quality issues/non-user friendly quirks with the RDX but the horrible suspension was a deal breaker (and ridiculous for a $36K ""luxury vehicle""). I've now sold the RDX - my first and last Honda/Acura product. Very happy with a German SUV now.

acura,rdx,2015,Renee, 09/27/2016,Loving this care,pos,"I bought this car with the technology pkg, it was previously leased.  Initially, I was interested only in the MDX because I thought this car would be too small; but after test driving the Audi Q5 and then this car; I realized this was the car for me.  The stereo system is great, it is so updated I didn't realize how behind I was with technology.  There only 2 things I would change - I would have liked to have a blind spot monitor on this vehicle and I would have gotten something other than black if available...now I will have to keep my car clean.

However, the disappointment is that it requires Premium gasoline.  It is reliable and dependable.  Great to drive and great features.  Disappointed that after 3 years...the value had depreciated.    Acura needs to work on improving their luxury vehicles gas type.

It has a smooth, quiet ride, great handling, excellent performance and great fuel economy (23.5 mpg avg). It also has an excellent sound system.

acura,rdx,2015,Lauren D., 05/07/2020,Very pleased,pos,"In 2018 I purchased a certified pre-owned RDX. I was nervous that I wouldn’t like it because I’m used to larger SUVs. Well 2 years later and I love it!! It’s perfect for me or with my kids. Plenty of space. Of course there’s a few things I wish it had, but regardless it’s an extremely safe and well priced luxury SUV. I need AWD which it has and it gets through the snow without a problem. My windows are all tinted so it gets a lot of looks and compliments.

acura,rdx,2016,Bob, 11/18/2015,Great overall value. Nice luxury features.,pos,"Owned the 2016 RDX for 2 months.  Bought the FWD with technology package.  The RDX has the best overall engine for small SUV.  Same engine as the MDX, but much smaller car means better performance.  Great HP for its class.  Very good gas fuel economy and uses regular unleaded gas.  Other SUV's that had similar HP were turbo charged engines that required premium gas (i.e. more expensive to operate).  Transmission is 6 speed automatic that is very smooth and shift points are perfect.  Ride quality is a little stiff, but that helps with handling.  The car is very quite when windows are rolled up.  Seats are very comfortable.  Very nice dual displays (one of which is touch screen).  Premium stereo with XM and HD FM.  I like the HD FM sound quality.  It has a 15GB hard disc so you can save CD's or transfer songs from USB stick.  There are 2 key fobs that you can customize most of the car features for each.  Seating position, radio settings, navigation settings, are just a few of the items.  Car recognize which key is closer and those settings are active for that driver.  Very nice.  Only a few negatives:  Lots of wind noise when back windows are down more than about 1 inch.  The electronics take about 1 minute to boot up when you start the car.  Does not sound like much, but much slower than my Lexus that is 8 years older.  Navigation system works good, but a little funky to set.  Sound quality is good compared to standard quality systems, but less than other premium systems.
** 2.5 years and 29K miles update.  Still very happy with the car.  No mechanical issues.  The stereo had some memory problem, but was under warranty so the dealer replaced it and solved the problem.  Really the only complaint is the slow electronics system.  Entering address in navigation system is cumbersome.  Usually just use Waze and skip the car nav system.  Other than that, the rest of the car runs perfectly.  Gas mileage still very good at 25MPG+ in mixes hwy/street driving.  Engine and transmission are strong.  No squeaks or rattles in the body.  The key fob memory is a really nice feature.  I like how seats adjust and my music stations are personalized for me when I am driving.

acura,rdx,2016,Steve K., 12/07/2015,"Test drove them all, RDX is the winner !",pos,"My wife never had a SUV and wanted one to be our next one. She has been driving an 08 awd Acura RL and loved it. We put snow tires on it for the winter and it was a tank in the snow with the SH awd. So for us to trade it in was a big deal. I started doing some research on Edmund's and started to list the suv's we should consider. I test drove over 12 myself and reduced it down to 5 we should consider. We decided to stay in the mid size or smaller range since it is just the two of us. We picked one day to test drive all 5 for comparison. The Lexus NX and RX were the first she drove. Next she drove the Acura RDX then the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe. The RDX beat them all with the 6 cylinder engine, it was by far the most peppy of them all and drove more sporty than the RX. It seems like everyone has an RX these days so they are kinda of boring to us. The RDX is full of technology which has been greatly been improved upon since we had it in our RL. The biggest is the blind spot, auto braking, cross traffic and adaptive criuse control. I have using them and they help greatly with driving. We are happy with our decision and have found acura's hold their resale value as well as being reliable. By the way, the Hyundai Tucson was our second choice, which we may buy as a second car in the future. It is about $10000 less than the RDX and has alot of the same features.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Ralph Smith, 11/23/2015,Comfortable Ride with Tech Pkg to Make Geeks Happy,neu,"I bought this car because the ride is quiet, the acceleration is excellent, the ride is comfortable, it has a very good safety rating and safety technology is state of the art. I also liked the Acura's reputation for reliability. I enjoy a good sound system and the RDX with the Advance package is among the best I have heard in a car. 

We drive a lot of miles each year on long vacation driving trips. Since the car is also used around town, the smaller size of this SUV is convenient as it rides well on a trip but also easy to park in a city.  

There have been a couple of surprises. While I knew the car had great safety features, I had not really experienced the changes introduced to my life by this car until taking it on a trip shortly after buying the car. The surprise is that it requires changing how to drive in many respects and requires a new driver for this car to adjust to the technology.

Specifically, the ability of the car to adjust its speed with the traffic. Don't misinterpret: I like the changes but on a busy interstate, one needs to pay attention to adjust to the changes. Cars and trucks pull in front of a car unexpectedly. The first time this happened, the Acura RDX slowed dramatically and automatically. I did not have to apply the brakes. Several days into this driving trip, I had adjusted and found myself becoming almost lackadaisical about this feature as the car almost adjusts itself. Driving is more relaxing. On a busy highway, I disabled the system though as the distance between my car and the next vehicle was long, even with the lowest setting, and occasionally a large number of cars would continually pull in front and constantly slow down our pace of driving.

I did not like the feature of adjusting the steering  when changing lanes or moving in traffic. I turned this feature off quickly. No doubt, I will try it again but doubt it will be useful or one that I will use with any regularity. I prefer to drive the car and change lanes as necessary without objection from the computer in the car.

My biggest complaint in an otherwise excellent vehicle is the navigation system. I don't like it or how in integrates with the other system technology. The navigation systems in previous cars are much better. The Acura system is not intuitive or designed with the driver or consumer in mind. It works with the voice control but the list of possible commands is long and ignores some of the most common features available on other vehicles.

I still do not know if I can send instructions to the car to follow a route I have created on the computer. The Acura site indicates I can do this. The salesman who sold us the car said he had never heard of that feature. A system like this works well on a Mercedes that I own. The manual is silent on on how to do it. The website offers no advice. I do not mind making a call with Acuralink to enter the destination but would prefer to map it out myself to select my own routes.

The ability to use the smartphone with the Acura's system is an excellent innovation. I also like being able to stream a podcast or Pandora through the stereo system. Sirius XM generally works well with the Acura although the traffic and weather features do not integrate with the RDX. We used those features extensively with a 2012 Murano and this lack of integration is a significant failing of a luxury SUV. There is weather and traffic information on the RDX, it is not up to Sirius.

Unfortunately, the navigation system operates in its own universe. The voice system giving directions cannot be heard clearly while sound is coming through these other systems. Instead, the systems yammers away incessantly with turns and directions while leaving the stereo system as a higher volume. Moreover, attempts to turn down the navigation system with the voice controls apparently cannot be done. At least I have not found a way to
 do this or to find in the documentation how it can be done.

In my older Murano, I was able to know when the next rest area was coming up as well as when the next exit was coming up. Not so in the Acura. Asking for rest areas results in a list of rest areas, some of which may be behind on the route being traveled or may be many miles ahead. The information is useless. 

One friend who bought an Acura said he gave up and bought a Garmin navigation system to use instead of the built in system. I now know how he felt and I am inclined to agree. The nav system in the RDX is a major disappointment. As a person who uses a system like this extensively on trips, I have already found using Google maps or Waze on my IPhone to be much more useful and easier to use. With an MSRP of $45,000 for this luxury SUV, I expected much better. Moreover, the Acura salesman was not well versed in how to use the system so learning how to use it has been largely trial and error and stopping occasionally to check the manual to see if we missed something that would make it more useful.

acura,rdx,2016,Pete Pop, 07/30/2016,Very pleased with this vehicle,pos,"This vehicle is fantastic!  I test drove a Ford Explorer, Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe and I bought the RDX with the tech package.  The reliability reviews over the others was one of the main points but after owning it I really have come to appreciate its high points.  The ride is smooth, powerful and really quiet.  The sound canceling system (like Bose headphones) does a great job. Being a musician, I was impressed with the stereo and during my test drive we adjusted the base and subwoofer to full potential and I was blown away.  The sound quality with the ten speakers in neural mode (surround sound) is amazing. Some reviewers complained about having two screens.  I prefer it and it’s much more pleasing to be able to still see your audio screen while navigation is showing on a different screen.  Brilliant!  They recommend 91 octane which basically doesn’t exist anywhere so I need to use 93.  I’m not thrilled about that but at least gas is cheap now.  I drive both highway and city to get to work so it seems I’m averaging around 19 mpg. No long trips yet to really see highway mileage. I live in South Florida and I can say that the air really cranks.  Most of the time I only have the fan halfway even though the leather seats in summer can be hot.  The advanced package has ventilated seats but will cost you at least $3500 more on your out the door price.  I passed.  The shortcuts menu, speed dial options, voice prompts and other technology is a big plus.  I went from a stupid car (Honda Accord 2007) to this so it’s like walking onto the Enterprise!  I can’t imagine anyone buying this car and not liking it.  I paid $40,000 even out the door which seems to be a pretty decent price for a 2017 with the tech package. Updated11/3/2016. I can now confirm highway mileage on a long trip at 29 mpg which is as Acura estimated.  I like this car even more now as I've been using more of the bells and whistles. I REALLY appreciate the back up cross traffic alert."
acura,rdx,2016,Stephanie, 10/28/2015,Happy w/ the 2014 RDX - Even Happier w/ the 2016!,pos,"This is my 2nd RDX. My first was a 2014, which I was happy with, despite a few minor irritations. The 2016 took care of my irritations with added technology, specifically the blind spot and rear traffic warning sensors and changes in the technology package. The RDX has two good blind spots so the new tech is fantastic and solves the issues - and works beautifully. The 2016 feels heavier and drives smoother than the 2014. The steering feels better and more substantial, as well.  It is also quieter with less wind noise and a smoother sunroof mechanism.   I did purchase a wind deflector this time though. I love the 3D navigation viewing option and the 10-speaker sound system is wonderful.  I've had Acuras since 2000 - three TLs (2000, 2003 and 2008), the 2014 RDX and now the 2016 RDX.  My 2000 TL had transmission issues, which were taken care of by the dealer even though the warranty had expired. I've always been treated well by the Dealer (in South Orange County in California).  I did not test drive competitors' vehicles, but did a lot of research on the Lexus RX, Lincoln MDX, Mercedes GL and GLK and some of the BMW and Audi SUVs, which would have fit into my budget. At the end of the day, I could not justify a higher cost for the competitors (when comparing the multitude of packages available with the competition), even though they may be more prestigious in name and perhaps more luxury interiors.  The value, quality and solid luxury of the Acura won out when I decided not to tie up more of my money and still have all the bells and whistles you get with the RDX.

10-28-2018 Update - I still love this car.  My only complaint is the Apple Car Play, which is not an Acura issue.  The connection is at time touchy and at least once a month I have to into the settings on the car and re-enable the connection, if plugging and unplugging my iPhone doesn't reset it.  Fortunately the touch pad is easy to use and I've been able to re-set the connection pretty easily.

Only had it a month but it takes some work to master, and i havnt , and not sure i ever will. Best way is to put in an address before you leave, trying to find a certain restaurant etc on the go gets frustrating. I get better mileage than stated which is a nice surprise. Love the blind spot detector and the backup camera is awesome, really gets a wide view which is great. I am not disappointed with this suv at all, just the oppisite. Best bang for your dollar by far. Oh yeah the seats, especially the cooled option are the most comfortable of all the higher end SUVs, at least for me.

Took ride up to Minnesota and ride was very stress free with cruise control system features.   Smooth quiet ride.

The first was approaching 10 years old original owner no problems aside from normal maintenance items. The 2016 RDX has come a long way -  is extremely comfortable fun to drive and loaded with Technology and safety features. The adaptive cruise and lane keeping assist work very well. If you're in the market for a reliable new car with state of the art technology this is one you should take a good look at. While i'm not big on extended warranties, especially not having any issues with my first RDX, they did sell me on a transferable 4 year extended ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty (9 years total). If nothing else it adds re-sell value. My only con is interior/exterior color selection. You're pretty much stuck with what they offer but not a deal breaker. Overall very happy.

acura,rdx,2016,Terry, 09/02/2015,Way better than expected!,pos,"We expected the RDX to be a great car but it has exceeded all our expectations.  The tech packages work fantastic.  The only issue is it offers so much tech that we keep learning new ways to operate the vehicle.  The car is very quiet, the ride is smooth and the mileage is very good for a new vehicle.  I would recommend the RDX to anyone looking for a smaller vehicle but needs lots of room for riders (I'm 6""2"" and my son is 6'5"" and sits comfortably in the front seats.)
"
acura,rdx,2016,Mike Wilson, 04/21/2016,Worst vehicle over $30K I've ever owned,neg,"While there were some high points with my 2016 RDX, all in all, it was the worst $30K+ vehicle I've ever owned.  First and foremost, the electronics in my vehicle were so buggy and unreliable, it became positively maddening.  About 1/3 of the time, my hands-free calls would fail to connect and leave the phone in ""private mode"" and utterly useless for 2-3 minutes.  Worse yet, the voice recognition was horrific.  The car dialed 9-1-1 three different times when I asked it to ""call Taco Deli.""  For all intents and purposes, the bluetooth phone operation was worthless.

The entertainment system worked okay, however, the preset labels rarely displayed the ACTUAL saved station.  When I pushed preset 1, the tuner would tune to 94.7, exactly as expected, but the label on the display was sometimes 138.9, sometimes all Cyrillic characters, sometimes all 1's and many other random values.  As long as I remembered what preset went with which stations, I was good to go.

The navigation system works, but the traffic indicators are illegible.  It actually took me a couple of weeks to realize I actually had traffic indicators on the Nav because the colors are so muted and the lines so fine.

Traction was abysmal in the rain and poor when it was dry.  While the RDX handles well (within traction limits), and ride quality was good, the traction was just such a liability.

Interior build quality was revealed itself to be sub-par over the second half of my year of ownership.  I had squeaking, creaking rear suspension, rattling door panels and a squealing A/C fan.

Under the hood, only one complaint.  I had a pulley that squealed as it spun down after engine shutdown.

On the plus side, Fuel economy was quite good and when I sold it last week, I got $35,000 for trade-in after only paying $39,500.  Headlights and general visibility from the vehicle were first rate.  That's about it for positives.

acura,rdx,2016,Gene, 04/23/2016,The RDX offers the best overall value for money.,pos,"It may not be the best vehicle in each and every category in its class, but when you weigh the pros and cons of the competition, it comes out on top. The factors that I look at in an SUV, are ride, performance, styling, interior room, resale and reliability. Sure, if money wasn't a factor, I would have chosen an Audi 6 cylinder Q5, or a BMW twin turbo X3. I just don't see $10,000 to $12,000 worth of difference. Keep in mind most of the competition comes standard with 4 cylinder engines. The RDX has surpassed my expectations in my early ownership, and I suffer no buyers remorse. My only issue is that I had to pay $468 to the service department for a ""spare tire kit"", as it comes with only an inflator and sealant pump. Other then that, all is well with my RDX.

All and all, its beautiful!  We have had it a year now and I am still in love with it.

We've found it very comfortable on a long road trip and around town.  We also feel that the understated styling will endure over time without looking odd or dated.

The downsides: confusing owner's manual, slight blind spot on left front side, I've got wind noise at speed from I assume the outside mirror. After 1 year I still don't know how to do a lot of the controls even after reading the manual several times (and I have the base model). Not an exciting car but then I'm dull myself.

acura,rdx,2016,Frank Runco, 10/09/2015,Nice,pos,"This is our 3rd RDX and I must say the 2011 was best the best handling and most fun to drive although kinda choppy. I liked that, wife didn't. We got the advanced package and the tech is way much and rather complicated for her. It's her car and she likes it. Got the advanced because of parking sensors front and back and nicer rims. Biggest complaint was the lack of color selection (did away with silver-now slate silver BLUE) ugh. Bought the white. Almost went to BMW because of that. Interior selection also limited, parchment only with white, no black.
 They still insist on a 16 gallon tank, way too small considering mileage has been about 21. Always stopping to feel up. Took a small 200 mile trip and still about 22.5. We've never had an issue with an Acura product and love our dealer. Have a 12 TSX and 14 TL SHAWD as well. Love them all. 
In retrospect tech would have been fine at 3000 less. And yes she would buy again.

UPDATE Have now had this vehicle 7 months and still not sure of the tech stuff and not liking most of it. Hard to see buttons and writing on them. Find myself searching all the time. Dual screen is foolish, makes no sense and is distracting while driving and hard to see in sun. Stupid that you cant operate phone book while driving. I guess designers think it's safer to pick up a phone and start searching. My 12 TSX and 14 TL both tech so much more user friendly. Find myself looking for those keys when heading out. Wife can have this thing, doesn't bother her because she ignores tech anyway.

acura,rdx,2016,WSD, 07/07/2016,First Acura - mixed feelings,pos,"the good stuff - overall a very nice ride. Good safety tech, stereo, looks and power. Stable at speed and good mid range power. Lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control are a great feature. Looks are very good. Stereo sounds very good. Seats are excellent, heated and cooled. dual zone climate control.  Several of the electronic features are very helpful.         The  not so great stuff - Transmission hunts a bit at low speeds on occasion, the nav system is a pain trying to use voice recognition to get a location. Still cant figure out how to just enter an address manually. Mileage is not as good as I had hoped but, mostly city driving so far so may improve.  It came down to this and a Lincoln MKC with 2.3 turbo. the Lincoln was faster and more luxurious but, went with the Acura for better resale value.

acura,rdx,2016,James Delaney, 06/29/2017,Junk the Navigation,pos,"If you absolutely rely on a navigation system to find your way around, buy another car or get an Iphone with bluetooth to feed reliable guidance.  The voice command feature offers choices that often don't relate to what you need and the thing usually doesn't accurately capture what you say.  The maps are sloppy and haven't kept up with other gps providers, so you routinely find yourself getting a signal that you are ""not on a digitized road"" when your iphone or Garmin shows that very road clearly. Lazy engineering here.  Also, there are destination commands that the system won't accept (try to enter Indianapolis International Airport on Co. H. Weir Road-mine won't take it).  Also, on a ""luxury"" car, one would think they would allow updates to the maps on a detachable thumb drive that could be plugged into a computer port instead of the clumsy, expensive updates-at-the-dealer system.  My urgent suggestion is that Acura (Honda) get in touch with the folks at Garmin who are developing an OEM navigation system for Daimler that doesn't have these faults and which may cost less now that development is about done.

acura,rdx,2016,6 month lease holder, 11/03/2016,6 month review,pos,"Very comfortable, more than adequate power, a pleasure to drive, especially on the open road. This suv could easily go all day smoothly and quietly at 80 mph. No maintenance issues so far.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Jenn S, 06/22/2018,After One Year...,neu,"Having given the base RDX a good year of use and driving 13k+ miles, I can report the following: THE GOOD (1) Ride is very comfortable, (2) road noise is low, (3) no issues with electronics or connecting my iPhone, (4) faux leather cleans up easily, (5) VERY fast and responsive acceleration, (6) nice, tight feel to the ride, (7) good sound system, (8) cabin is comfortable and solid feeling.  Now the NOT SO GOOD (1) HORRIBLE, I repeat, HORRIBLE gas mileage.  I get a combined 19 MPG, and probably only around 14 MPG around town - I was shocked at the numbers coming off owning a Honda CR-V.  For this reason alone, I will probably look at other brands for my next car. If you live in a flat area of the country and never use the AC, perhaps you'll get better mileage. (2) storage and cargo space is lacking and not very well thought out, (3) NO spare tire, and (4) jerky feel to the transmission when slowing/downshifting.

acura,rdx,2016,Margaret Neal, 04/19/2016,Not a cushy Buick,neu,"Great car to drive.  Adaptive Cruise, lane change warning and other safety features are just awesome.  Brakes are terrific.  Compared to our Lucerne, road noise is much worse, but tolerable; interior is not par w/price.  Ride is pretty good for suv.  Acura cheaps out on some features that will annoy you every time you drive it.  For the RDX, only one of the two key remotes w/the applicable pkg will start the car.  With the MDX, both remotes will do it.  Guess Acura saved a couple bucks to hack off customers.   Bad design is driver seat position.  Our Buick had it right..seat went all the way back when ignition turned off, making getting out really easy, after getting in, push driver 1 or 2 and seat, outside mirror, and interior mirror repositioned.  With the RDX, using the driver 1 or 2 setting, the seat positioned PRIOR to getting in.  For us short people, that made getting in difficult.  The inside mirror also was not among the setting.  We had to disable the seat positioning setting.  A really bad design.  Door panels are sorta cheap also.  Overall, a nice car, fun to drive but some cheap outs.  Not worth the price..but close.

I looked hard at the Audi Q5, Lexus F sport, Infiniti Q50, Mercedes ML, Honda CRV, Range Rover Evoque, BMX X3 and Porsche Macan.  When you put them all together and try to evaluate performance, reliability, value, and comfort, the 2016 RDX came out on top.  I look forward to many years with this vehicle."
acura,rdx,2016,Tom, 07/30/2015,2016 RDX Died in just 22 Days,neg,"Had my new RDX for 22 days and the instrument cluster blew out.  Was driving at night and the dash just went dark.  Got home but once I turned the car off it would not restart.   Just cranked.  No instrument lights, doors would not lock and the rear view camera display would not turn off.   Had vehicle towed to the dealer on July 15 and there it still sits as of July 29.   They replaced the cluster and that did not fix it.  Now they traced it to a wiring harness.   The dash of my new car has been disassembled and will never be the same nor will I ever be able to trust it.   I can already hear all the rattles.  I have owned Honda vehicles for 23 years and never had to have one towed.   Huge disappointment.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Jason, 04/05/2016,As Good as Advertised and Better in Some Ways,pos,"This is a really great car.  I got out of a BMW X5 for this one and the RDX is way better than my old bimmer.  The main thing I was looking for was a silky ride with a very quiet cabin.  I get both with this RDX.  The power train is exceptional with the standard v6.  The cabin is very quiet although some what less so than Edmunds reviews said.  Where Edmunds gave it an ""A"" - I would say it's probably a ""B"" or ""B+"".  It is quiet at low speeds but gets louder on highways.  As a plus, the ELS stereo on the Technology Package is an incredible system that makes the feint noise go away, replaced with beautiful music.  Navigation system is lame, use Google maps instead.  Edmunds says the screen controls for the tech is ""confusing"" but I disagree.  If this control panel confuses you, you probably shouldn't be buying something called a technology package. Love this car.  It's the best I've ever personally owned.
"
acura,rdx,2016,jrasero, 08/20/2015,35 more months to go!,pos,"Just leased a 2016 Acura RDX AWD Base.  Picked it up on July 31st and have put over 500 miles on it so far.  My purchase rational is comparing my parents Honda CRV EX-L Navigation versus a base RDX.  First and foremost the biggest difference between the CRV and RDX besides the Acura beak is the great 3.5 liter motor which has plenty of kick and power unlike the whiny CVT.  My father loves the great MPG on his CRV but hates the lack of power and secondly he hates the motor and wind noise.  The RDX has great pickup, the exhaust notes are smooth and crisp, and cabin noise is much better than a CRV and equal to my 2011 Lincoln MKZ.  The seats are comfy but the base comes with leatherette which is a little of a bummer, but the leatherette is still much better than the material used in an EX-L Honda.  The base is pretty bare bones and really to get the most bang for your buck the Acura Watch is the best option to choice.  Some standard features like blue ambient lighting,  turn signals, power lift gate, backup camera, keyless entry, push to start ignition, and sunroof are all notable.  The center stack and steering wheel still has way too many buttons. Visibility isn't great out of the back and getting Acura Watch w/ backup sensors would really help.  For a luxury car I would like to have seen backup sensors and blind spot warning standard.  Acura recommends premium fuel and on my first 2 tanks I have gotten 19 MPG average and 22 MPG average, hopefully after breaking in the motor and going for longer highway trips I will average 22-26 MPG.  Steering is good but numb and ride comfort is okay.  The RDX is firmer than I imagined and tends to bounce you around when going over bumps.  Value wise the RDX is hard to recommend over the CRV unless your like myself or my dad who finds the CRV to be noisy and slow and you don't prioritize MPG.  If the lack of power doesn't bother you a cheaper CRV is your bet.

Update:  June 2016 I actually sold the car after owning it for about 12 months.  Nothing wrong with the car but downgraded to an ILX due to space, mpg, and the car's eventual lease buyout.  I still stand by the fact that the RDX is the best value for a compact/midsize luxury crossover.  The tried and true 3.5 V6 has a ton of pickup and does 0-60 in about 6 seconds, while still getting 20/28 while smaller four cylinder turbo charged cars such as the Lexus NX get 22/28 mpg.  Moving to an ILX the biggest thing I noticed right away is space, since the RDX has plenty of it, whether your upfront, sitting in the back, or loading the trunk.  Also, the RDX is extremely composed and quiet compared to the ILX.  Uneven pavement, potholes, highway cruising the RDX is almost Lexus quiet.  The thing that I disliked about the RDX the most was that I got the base version so no real leather, no touch screen, no app integration, no safety features like  blind spot or adaptive cruise control, no ventilated front seats or heated rear seats.  Furthermore the RDX was just more car than I needed for grocery duties and weekend driving.  If I had kids, did more highway driving, or lived in a place with more snow or rain than the RDX would have been perfect.  Another great aspect of the RDX is the car's value.  I put maybe 7500 miles on it over 12 months and the car's value was almost $2000 above the lease buy out creating equity.  So if you are looking for a car that holds it value the RDX is great

acura,rdx,2016,Ted, 05/05/2016,Navpackage is not soa. Not recommended.,pos,"Update at 56000 miles.  OEM tires replaced.  Car is in like new condition.  Very pleased with it.  Navpackage remains a waste...apple play would have been nice but not offered on 2016.  Rest of review at 36k miles valid. 


36,000 miles in, have come to live with the idiosyncracies of the electronics.  The car is solid, gas milage is good...just under 30 on the highway.  Still a quiet vehicle. Found that we prefer the conflicting traffic signal in the rear view mirror to the other honda variant with a tv screen and rear view camera.  Lka is a light touch...not perfect but a good support system.  The auto braking system is helpful.  Best of all is the modern brakes...came to stop quickly on a night-black-ice road, true and straight.  Others behind me went off the road.  It is amazing (enginneeing marvel) to actually see how the 4 wheel drive system works when our car is dricen up an icy driveway.

acura,rdx,2016,HowardG, 06/05/2018,Acura RDX needs a makeover,pos,"The Acura RDX is well made with some classier features over the Honda lineup but they really need to step up their technology.  The SUV is solid riding, quiet and comfortable but the air vents are not layered out well and do not hold cell phones in almost any position.   The Bluetooth is quirky with iPhones and the navigation is fair at best.    They need an upgrade soon for the premium price of this vehicle.

acura,rdx,2016,Karen T., 02/13/2019,Transmission problems,pos,"I have had my RDX (purchased new) a few months shy of two years.  The car is perfect for me, the right size, decent gas mileage, enough power.  Until about a month ago that is, it started having a strong jerk upshifting to second gear, it was intermittent.  After the third time of experiencing this, I took it to the dealership, who mentioned nothing about this being a known problem.  They said they couldn't replicate the problem, so I got to run around using Lyft for the day.  The problem happened 4 days later and I drove to the dealership, this time the problem replicated and the tech who was driving with me said this is a known problem.  Thanks for wasting my Saturday.  I hope they can fix it.

The ride and comfort are on par with the Lexus RX350(which I had previously owned). I am getting better gas mileage and the overall safety features  are working as expected.Fit & finish is excellent. I have not been able to drive it yet in poor weather or snow, but I am confident on what I have read, it will perform well despite not having the SH-AWD feature.I will agree the navigation and voice controls are of lesser quality then a BMW or Audi, but the price of this vehicle for what you get in total far outweighs the issues compared to those other vehicles. Call this one a win! "
acura,rdx,2016,Richard Lee, 10/23/2015,"I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but...",pos,"I love this car very much, and I really want to give it a 5 stars review.  However, the breaking system seems not responsive enough, I have to press harder in order to make it stop.  Within a month, I heard noise while I hit break this morning, within a month!  The noise was gone when I drive it during my lunch break, maybe it's the temperature, but still, it shouldn't do that because it's a new car. 

Also, the engine is so called ""smart V6"", it switches from 3 cylinders to 6 cylinders depends on the situation, I can actually feel it.  The car vibrate a lot while it's on 3 cylinders mode, solid and smooth while it's on 6 cylinders.  Not very good. 

While the exterior is superb, it's way better than the previous RDX models, but the interior looked outdated compare with its competitors. 

The Bluetooth is convenient, but it kept disconnected and connected, can't stay connected.  Also, only the contact that's input to the speed dial (in car system, not phone speed dial) can display the caller ID when there is an incoming call.  There are only 15 space speed dial for RDX.  I missed many phone calls because I do not pick up number that I can't recognize, then I found those were actually people that I know but the car didn't display the caller ID because they are not in the car speed dial system. It's pretty dumb and outdated design. 

Finally, there is a backup camera, but no backup sensor... Doesn't make any sense.  The sensor should be standard if the camera is standard. 

Therefore, I like this car, but I can't give it a 5 stars because of the flaws mentioned above.

acura,rdx,2016,Joel, 04/05/2016,Bad car ruined by punishing suspension,neu,"Purchased the 2016 RDX advance which comes with nice tech features. Ride is comfortable on highway, punishing on bad pavement or potholes. Also what Acura claims are rain sensing wipers is false.they must be turned on and off manually each time it rains.as if left in Auto position, they continue to wipe even if dry.otherwise no complaints. Good car if you don't mind feeling every pebble on the road, but my last car was a Lexus so I may have been spoiled.

acura,rdx,2016,Nicole, 07/26/2015,Regret this purchase,neu,"I downsized from a GMC Yukon Denali for better gas mileage, and wanted a dependable newer car as my 04 was aging.  I am getting better than the 14/miles/gallon but not happy with car at all.  In the first month, already had AC go out during 90+ degree heat.  Was told it was low on freon.  A brand new car low on freon?   The navigation system is beyond frustrating and I end up using my smartphone or my TomTom.  The integrated voice command is not user friendly, despite spending many hours programing and watching videos on youtube as to how to ""learn"" the system.   As far as handeling, I know this is not a Denali or a BMW, but the handeling was very disappointing.  The first time I drove on wet roads I went through a very shallow puddle and I was nearly pulled off the road!  The interior is asthetically pleasing and comfortable, but I am very disappointed with the confusing set up of the bluetooth and voice commands as well as navigation.  I really would rather have my non-tech Denali back!   Car overall feels like a cheap SUV that has luxury interior.  The jewel headlights are GREAT and really light up the road at night.  LOVE those!

acura,rdx,2016,wayne21, 08/15/2015,Excellent car with lots of wind noise,pos,"Have had our 2016 RDX with Value package for about 500 miles.  We don't use the Bluetooth (don't talk on the phone while driving), but all the electronics seem great.  Phenomenal stereo system - easily the best we've ever had in a car.  The only real shortcoming is wind noise.  We test drove the vehicle twice and both times it was raining.  Now that we've driven the car for 500 miles I can truly say the wind noise is nothing short of ridiculous.  Yes, I know there is a three layer seal in the doors, but that doesn't stop the wind noise.  I don't know that we've never owned a car with wind noise this bad.  It's totally unacceptable for most cars, but for a car with a sticker price of roughly $43k it is shameful.  Cranking up the stereo is the only way to avoid hearing it all.

acura,rdx,2016,Alan, 01/02/2017,Great passing power,pos,"If you live in rural areas, RDX is your good choice. You can easy passing any car when you are going  up hills or passing the slow farm truck. But you still got good mpg. I drives mostly highway. I got 24mpg. On first 12000 mile.
Update 3 years of ownership, i have been moved from iowa to los angeles area. I have transmission problems and engine oil leaking issues  and the rear passenger seat bait problem but it was covered by Acura warranty services. I drive 50% highway and got 20 mpg only from 12000 to 30000 miles. I have been drove my RDX  from Iowa to Los Angeles, it was more then 1890 mile one way. I got 26 mpg. It was no problem on Rocky mountain. I have a 2016 toyota tundra with 5.7L engine. I drove the same route from iowa to los angeles. I have problem to go up hill without towing and heavy load. My cruise control have three time lost power when uphill. It was acceptable. 
Update my 4th years of ownership, My car just hit 57000 mile. I drive 90% in local street right now. I just got 19 mpg. I just have a brake sensor problem. I have been paid for $180 to fixed.  The car still good. The leather still look new without any special care. Only complaint is the oil change. All of the Honda and Acura have a sensor and service reminder to show you which service you need to do and how my percent duo. After i move to Los Angels. I needed to go to dealer almost every 4500 to 5000 mile from around 6 to 7000 in iowa with 90% of highway drive. So i need to go to dealer every 3 to 4 months. The micheline tire just down to 3/32 .

acura,rdx,2016,Glenn M., 06/25/2018,1016 RDX AWD: Almost Perfect,pos,"High Tech, High quality, Excellent Value.  I live on a steep hill and the AWD has worked well in heavy snow with factory all-season tires.  The car has remained solid and quiet after 3 years and 21,000 miles.  I find the GPS awkward to program.  Integration with my android phone has been spotty.  Cell phone messaging support has been on and off (currently on).  When I use google maps (GPS) on the Samsung phone, I need to turn off the cellphone bluetooth or play the GPS audio through the bluetooth input (without music).  I would prefer published maintenance intervals; the dealer sometimes suggested very short durations between maintenance events.  The service quality has been excellent, however.

acura,rdx,2016,SUV_bob, 09/24/2019,Great value as a used lux crossover,pos,"After reviewing on Edmunds and elsewhere I picked one up in 2019 to use as a high mileage sales car.  Now my wife and I use it more than the big Suburban sitting in the driveway.  Great get in and go SUV, great V6 power and rev sound, smooth tranny, nice handling and ride.  Comfortable for a big guy like me.  AWD is basic and really only works for getting up hills and starts in snow.  Easy to work on if you are into self maintenance.

Cons - wish it had wider tires (cosmetic thing), wish it had better infotainment system (very hard to use), wish it looked more upscale and less like a Honda CRV, wish it had higher towing capacity (probably can tow more that it is rated for).  

Issues - jerky shifting transmission - if this happens to you with your RDX it is a common issue and the dealer knows exactly what it is and how to fix it.  If the dealer acts like they don't know - they know.   

Other than that it is a super great value when purchasing as a used car."
acura,rdx,2016,Randy, 06/23/2016,Again......Acura gives you value for the money!!,pos,"Traded in a 2006 Acura TL that was really a great car and tremendous value. Would have kept but needed an all wheel drive vehicle due to moving north into snow areas. The RDX is a high quality ride and as always with Acura....reliable and great performance. The ride is smooth with tight handling. Mileage around town is 23-24 and on the road 31-33 depending on terrain.  Interior fits well with a normal size person and everything is within reach easily to see and operate. You won't be disappointed with this vehicle.

Update 12/23/18: Continue to be happy with the RDX now 3 years and 17,000 miles later. You won't be disappointed.
Update 12/26/19: Again, continue to be happy with the quality of the RDX, 24000 miles and 4 years in. Still very satisfied.

acura,rdx,2016,Richard Fisher, 08/21/2015,Another disappointment,neg,"This is my second RDX.  I had a 2013 Base AWD drive model which was a very nice car but lacked the technology options.

Now I have an 2016 Advanced AWD and the technology looks promising but disappoints again.  The Nav system has only level of directions; no verbose or minimal.  The instructions do not override the radio .  I would like to have the radio go silent so I can hear the instructions. Yes I can turn the instructions off which is nice.

The speed limit is not shown (nicer would be if the speed would go red if I above it - either 1 mph or some amount I specify).  

The nice folks at Acura could not help me move my addresses from my Garmin to the Acura Nav system.

Wonder if Acura will ever truly think through the tech on their cars?

After 2 years.  While the car is a pleasant to drive, I find it taking in a number of ways. 
-  Adaptive cruise control is very abrupt, especially when someone moves into my lane. 
- The rear area is too small.  My wife has an outback and her back area is about a foot longer.
-  Fuel economy is the same (on paper) as the MDX though the MDX is significantly larger and weighs much more.

After two years with the car, I am trading it in for more space on an Outback.  Not as fancy, not as plush, but at least I will not feel cheated.  Acura failed to deliver on (1) fuel economy, (2) technology, and (3) interior space.  I  believe all this was done to protect the more pricy and profitable MDX line.  Here is a message for Acura - if you don't eat your own lunch, someone else will do so.  In protecting the MDX from the dumbed-down RDX you have made the RDX vulnerable to competitors.  And I have succumbed to a better car, IMO, at a much lower price.

After 2 years I decided to change to a Subaru Outback.  It has more space in the back and is a more honest car.  No dumbing down, WYSIWYG.

The chrome-look has been removed from most of interior, the navigation box is too small and the touch screen is difficult to operate.  The luxury is gone, interior looks and feels smaller, doors even feel lighter.   The front of the vehicle has been redesigned and looks great, but everything else was too significantly flawed to hold my interest.   By comparison, very disappointing compared to the 2014 model I previously owned and way overpriced.   I chose not to purchase.

acura,rdx,2016,Marcus, 07/03/2016,Traded in after 7 months for REAL luxury SUV,neg,"What a waste of time and money for a ""Honda"". I purposely purchased a RDX w/ tech package for the navi and the so called premium audio system. I ended up using google maps on my phone for directions. The RDX navi couldn't find half the places I wanted directions to and worse neither the navi nor a live Acuralink representative could give me correct directions to the nearest ER. I ended up at dead end streets. I brought the car in to be checked and Acura couldn't find any problems. What made me trade it in after only putting 2,000 miles on the SUV was the day I almost collided head on with oncoming traffic due to the fact that I was using Google maps to find a local business. After that, all I wanted to do was get rid of the near cause of a death or two. Will NEVER buy a Acura again!!

acura,rdx,2016,Torr310, 07/02/2016,My first Acura (RDX FWD w/ Acura Watch),pos,"Pro: Most of the parts worked very well. 

Con: The transmission is not as smooth and sometimes jitters found at low speed start, especially when the engine is cold.

Other thought: Wish the screen for backup camera could be 6"" or larger.

Update 7/9/18:

Pro: 
The engine is probably the best in the segment, although the max torque output could be at lower RPM.  More confident for the V6 than the turbo engines.  Very reliable, nothing needs to be fixed so far!

Cons: 
Tires screech easily at the start.  The Backup camera has poor visibility at dark.

4-5 year old entertainment system very similar to wife’s 2012 CRV. Leasing based on $38k sticker price. Smaller trunk space compared to 2012 CRV. 6 speed Transmission not as smooth as with base 2014 BMW 328 sedan. (Eight speed)

acura,rdx,2017,tabjaxx, 01/17/2017,First try with a luxury brand--2017 Acura RDX AWD,pos,"My wife wanted a small, luxury SUV and we settled on a 2017 Acura RDX AWD base model.  It is a solid SUV with nice features for a base model.  No squeaks or rattles.  Initial gas mileage was 25 mpg before the cold weather settled in, dropping it to a still respectable 23 mpg.  I like the variable cylinder management that shuts off 3 cylinders during low output conditions.  It is such a smooth process you don't know when it is happening.  The technology interfaces are kind of old fashioned for an upper end vehicle.  No touch screens or fancy graphics.  Buttons and knobs are nicely laid out, but I wish fan speed was controlled by a knob instead of buttons.  Radio does not stay on after car shuts off.  Seats are comfy, but leatherette surfaces are more like plastic than leather.  Heated seats warm up fast, but I miss a heated steering wheel.  Elevated rear seats are nice with plenty of legroom.  Great visibility out rear and side windows.  The 19.5 gallon gas tank could be larger.   The AWD version comes with a spare tire instead of a tire repair kit.  Headlights look and function great.   Overall, happy with the vehicle.  It doesn't necessarily have the feel of a luxury vehicle, but we don't feel we paid a luxury price for it either.

acura,rdx,2017,Happy, 07/18/2016,RDX > Competition,pos,"Three years/40K miles and still a winner.  Front right parking proximity sensor occasionally too sensitive but not a big deal.  

Updated:  Over a year in to it and still love the vehicle.  Utilizing the tech is still harder than it should be.

First Acura.  We (truthfully my wife) were looking for a medium size SUV to replace our 2001 Honda Odyssey.  We test drove the RDX, Lexus RX 350, Nissan Murano, and a loaded out Honda CRV.  RDX was our first choice by a mile.  Super smooth power train and very quiet/smooth ride.  Easily best value in its class.  Back seat room is exceptional for two adults but three would definitely be a crowd.  Only downsides include cludgy technology/interfaces, smallish gas tank, and somewhat narrow driver and front passenger seating.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Michael Marynowski, 07/08/2016,Very Nice vehicle,pos,"This is a vehicle that compares to competing brands that are much more expensive. I bought this RDX while trading in my larger MDX. The biggest difference is this is the little brother to the MDX and does not have the 3rd row of seats and thus less cargo space as well. I didn't need the space and welcomed the smaller SUV with better gas mileage! If I have any complaint at all it is that the front driver seats appears to be much smaller than the one that was in my 2012 MDX. It has been taking me awhile to get used to it. The bigger MDX seemed to have more support particularly with a bigger seat body that went up to the back of my knees. Other than that the car is fantastic. First time having cooling ventilating front seats which is a joy during the hot days. Definitely go with the Advance Package. All the goodies that go with it are worth the price!
"
acura,rdx,2017,Carlos Guzman, 02/24/2017,A sensible choice,pos,"I just got this recently, so I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I think that I have a pretty good idea of what this car is. Likes: the power and the price. Those were the two main factors that made me pull the trigger. They had a great lease deal and I really wanted a V6 instead of a turbo 4. Other cars I considered were the new Lexus RX350 (which was at least $150 more a month), the BMW X3 and the 3-series GT (probably $200 more a month, and their down payments are considerably more) and the Lexus NX 200t (smaller and turbo engine). The build quality is great. I got the base model with the leatherette seats and they feel very nice, other than the strong plastic smell. No sweet leather smell here. I like that this is lower than most SUVs, so it handles so much better and if feel almost like, dare I say, a sporty sedan. I had a Toyota Highlander before, and I wanted to avoid the dynamics of a heavy and soft SUV. . . It was a pregnant cow on wheels. The RDX's engine sounds sweet and pulls great -- the transmission, on the other hand, is slow and outdated. Forget using the paddle shifters, they are slow and there's a jerk when downshifting. Better just use your foot and/or sport mode and leave the paddles alone. This engine with modern 8-speed transmission would kill. Comfort is okay. Some people have complained about RDXs having suspension problems. The car doesn't like bumps. You can feel and hear the suspension working and I do think it's a design flaw, but not a defect per se. I did have suspension problem on a 2011 Honda Odyssey, and after multiple trips to the dealership and opening a case with corporate, they were never able to fix it. It's just like every other manufacturer, they have known problems with their car and they jerk you around until you give up. I personally like the simple entertainment system in this base model. Acura's technology package is outdated. I do wish the stereo was a bit better, but I can live with it. Bluetooth always pairs without fail with my iPhone 6. All in all, this is a great small SUV if you want acceleration, a bit of luxury, decent cargo space, and a low price. I think that naturally aspirated V6s are a dying breed, and by the time this lease is up, I'd probably be faced with choosing a 4-cyl turbo, or some type of hybrid system -- which I guess wouldn't be that bad. So far I'm getting 18 mpg (90% city traffic), and that combined with a smallish fuel tank has me going to the pump more frequently than I'd prefer.

acura,rdx,2017,drjcool1, 11/24/2016,The right decision on a 2017 Acura RDX Advance,pos,"I have been researching and shopping for a new vehicle for several months.  I had narrowed it down to the Acura RDX awd and Lexus NX and briefly thought about waiting until the new Honda CRV makes it's debut next month. Well, I just pulled the trigger on the RDX with all the bells and whistles, and I couldn't be happier.  It drives beautifully. It is quiet, responsive, and displays impressive handling.  Although the tech is probably of 2015 vintage (no apple car play or android auto), with ACC, LKAS, blind spot monitoring, collision mitigation, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, and stability control, I reallyb don't feel that I am sacrificing anything. I have no problem with the double screen setup, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, I enjoy having the big map always being displayed on the upper screen.  The ""cherry"" on top was a killer deal I secured after visiting/communicating with multiple Acura dealers in the NY area. I strongly suggest that you do your due diligence.
"
acura,rdx,2017,John, 06/09/2018,Great Daily Driver and Roadtrip Cuiser,pos,"I purchased a very low mileage (less than 1,000 miles!) CPO AWD RDX Advance, had it shipped from out of state due to wanting Fathom Blue Pearl and none were available locally and Advance trim was even more difficult to find.  Traded in an Infiniti G37x due to needing more space but not wanting to sacrifice too much performance and I love the RDX more than I thought I would.  Very comfortable as a daily commuter and navigating through rush or driving hours on end up to the cabin.  I thought I really wanted a BMW X3 or Audi Q5 but after looking at maintenance expenses and higher insurance costs ($20-30$ more/month for the German cars and RDX is same as my G37) plus long term Honda reliability and resale value, RDX was an easy choice.  I drove all three SUVs in heavy snow storms (I live in Minneapolis) before purchasing which I highly recommend doing and despite the less sophisticated AWD system in the RDX, it performed just as well on both slick roads and unplowed parking lots as the X3 and Q5.  For those who do not know, the AWD system in the RDX was updated for the 2016 refresh with a larger rear differential, thicker drive shaft, and larger rear axle drive shafts to handle a 60/40 front/rear power split as well as provide better dry road handling.  The 2013-15 RDX can only manage a 75/25 power split and in testing another family members '13 RDX, the updated AWD system handles foul weather significantly better and the rear differential does not overheat as it does in the earlier models.  The RDX rides much softer than the X3 and the V6 is incredibly smooth and quiet.  A recent 1,000 mile road trip yielded 30.5mpg round trip so no disappointment there.  I thought my Infiniti was quiet on the highway but wow is the RDX hushed when cruising at 75mph.  Other reviewers said this car was noisy inside but I highly disagree as do the professional auto publications.  In comparison, I was disappointed by how much road and wind noise the BMW let into the cabin at highway speeds.  The seats are extremely comfortable (I am 5'7""), ACC cruise control and lane keep assist work well, and the rear cross traffic alert is nice to have in busy parking lots.  ELS stereo has great sound quality and thump from the subwoofer and having both heated and cooled front seats is game changing.  I actually like the two screen setup and the NAV system will redirect you if there is a traffic incident.  I also like how it shows your next turn in the meter display along with the compass and other vehicle information.  My only gripe which I knew when buying this car is it a FWD platform with a transversely mounted motor and unequal length drive shafts so hard acceleration does bring just a slight, slight hint of torque steer but again, the updated AWD system does mitigate this compared to base FWD models and earlier production AWD RDX's.  Otherwise, I really enjoy this car for its looks, features, and all around handling/daily livability.

acura,rdx,2017,Mia, 12/30/2016,"LOVE IT, BUT...",pos,"Love my 2017 RDX , only has 1,200 miles, but I've had to bring it in to dealership for repairs already!   First incident:   Navigation screen kept freezing up and or did not work properly.  At one point, I was in Drive but the screen showed the rear view camera on.  Very unnerving!  I had to pull off the road on several occasions, turn off engine and then restart the car.   When I brought car to dealer, they claimed that they did not see the problem.  However, after I picked up the car, the problem seems to have disappeared.   Hmmm.....                                          Second  incident:   The brakes started squeaking.   Thought it would go away but, no.   Brought it back in and was told that something was defective in the installation.  They had to put in brand new brake pads.   Really???    A brand new car????    So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else will go wrong.   Love the comfort and safety of the car.   Fun driving!

acura,rdx,2017,Happy Driver, 10/21/2016,Happy Acura Driver,pos,"I was looking for a vehicle to replace my 2011 Lexus that had high mileage, and wanted a change.  The new Lexus is bigger than my previous Lexus and I did not want that large a vehicle.  I had test driven an Acura previously and went to the Acura dealer to check them out.  I love the design, I bought the RDX Advance, it is larger than the Acura I test drove 5 years ago, it is a great size for me.  It has a lot of bells and whistles' that is, technology features.  It is taking me a while to master them. But, I love the lane assist and blind spot warning, which takes no tech knowledge to operate.  I have only had the car 3 weeks, but so far, love it.  It drives so smoothly, with no noise.  The seats are very comfortable, great lumbar support.  I look forward to several years of great driving with this Acura RDX.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Norm in Amish Country, 10/28/2016,Nicely finished great drive with confusing Tech IF,pos,"Love the fit and finish throughout the exterior and interior of the RDX.    I like that I can plug in my iPod and control it completely from the audio interface.  The interface, however, is far from intuitive and I've often had to pull over in order to work through several attempts to complete an action (One example: search for and play a single song then revert back to shuffle and play the entire collection).  The front doors close with a nice solid ""thunk"".  The rear doors seem very light and uninsulated.   The gas tank could be larger -- it's 16 gallons which, with an average 23 mpg around town, gets me through about 380-400 miles before needing a refill.  Seems to come up way more quickly than my former car (a Buick Lacrosse that had a much larger tank and got slightly fewer mpg's).  I appreciate the ease of entry, the controls and comfort of the driver's seat, and the get-up-and-go when you hit the gas.  Love the car!
"
acura,rdx,2017,Chris P., 09/26/2017,A great car with a major flaw,neg,"So many things to like about this vehicle! Great cabin, smooth ride, sweet V6, impressive tech (except for the dual-screen radio/nav situation, just poor design)...until you get to around 5 to 7K miles and the brakes start screeching like you're driving with the emergency brake on. You don't expect a significant car component to fail that quickly, especially given Acura's reputation, for which I apparently gave them too much credit. A quick google search makes it clear this is a known issue. Very disappointing, Acura.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Dave Hagan, 09/26/2016,2017 Acura RDX Advance AWD,pos,"Updated 3/27/19:

Absolutely zero problems or warranty issues since purchasing almost 2 and 1/2 years ago. My wife loves to driving the RDX. Gets good mileage, around 24mpg on average. Technology could definitely use some improvement (voice recognition, slow interface). Could definitely use Google Maps / Apple Car Play. Extremely happy with the RDX still.


As the owner of a 2016 Acura MDX, my wife loved driving it but wanted something a little smaller. She drove a number of vehicles and came back to the Acura RDX. It was the best mix of comfort, luxury, sportiness, and safety of any vehicle she test drove. She is currently 3 weeks in to ownership and completely loves it. She was coming from an Infiniti G37, so was used to great acceleration. The RDX doesn't disappoint as it's one of the quickest vehicles in it's class. The only complaints would be average to below average navigation system and lack of power folding mirrors, panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel, backseat climate controls, and Android Auto / Apple Car Play. The car excels in just about every other area. The Modern Steel Metallic with Graystone interior is gorgeous. Averaging 23 mpg around town.

3-26-18 Update: 18,000 miles later,My wife still loves the car as much as Day 1. Still zero issues with the RDX. Only complaint is really the outdated and slow navigation system.

acura,rdx,2017,Hunter, 08/04/2016,Love my new RDX!,pos,"Just bought my Fully loaded RDX and it's amazing!   Beautiful inside and out.  The tech is awesome and it practically drives itself.   Love the way it handles - very easy to drive - no blind spots thanks to the warnings and collision prevention and it's so easy to drive it almost handles more like a car than an SUV.   Highly recommend!  Love mine.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Robert Nordlie, 11/19/2016,Almost perfect RDX,pos,"I've had my RDX for a month and already have 2000 miles on it.  Overall, I love the car.  Very comfortable seats and ride, however, I've had a little difficulty finding and ideal driving position.  I am very tall and with the seat all the way back to accommodate my legs, the steering wheel does not telescope quite far enough to be completely comfortable.  Many complain about the two screen technology but I like it very much.  I also own a Corvette so I like to go fast, and as a result I'm only averaging about 21 mpg around town, but that's fine with me since I had a Ford Explorer Sport before this and only got 17 mpg with that.  Overall, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this vehicle.  I really like the styling, with the door handles contoured to the belt line and the LED headlights.   I also like the clean back end with no bumper sticking out below the hatch and not visible exhaust tips (and yes I do like the four exhaust trumpets on my Vette).
"
acura,rdx,2017,Scott, 12/27/2016,So far so good.,pos,"UPDATE 12/27/17 - after owning this car for 13 months and 12k miles, nothing has changed. Basic maintenance and same comfort and performance. My only minor complaint is the passenger window occasionally goes down about a half inch on its own. I notice because it rattles. I don't know why it dies this- almost like road bumps rattle it loose. I switch between regular and premium gas and notice no difference in mpg. Car feels like it runs better on premium but not enough to justify the 70 cents + per gallon difference. 

Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.

acura,rdx,2017,Bunni, 01/12/2017,Gorgeous but Tech Not!!,pos,"This RDX is gorgeous and unassuming!  (I'm still getting used to it as I've owned it for less than 30 day.) I treated myself with the top of the line all the bells and whistles!!  I love it!!  The only issues I see is with the Navigation system and headlights.   I traded a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and expected Acura's Navigation system to be superior, however to my surprise my Cherokee's was far more superior and so intuitive.  I didn't need to read the manual or look up any info regarding it.  Also although Acura advertised the best headlights I can't see a difference from my 2015 Cherokee.  As I said I do LOVE this SUV, the ride is very comfortable and I love the AWD and all the safety features.  I think this is a great value and I plan to keep this SUV forever!!"
acura,rdx,2017,Miguel, 04/08/2019,Get into an RDX if you value your money,pos,"This base model is just that base. No extra pampering or extra gizmos but that’s what we wanted. However, being an Acura this SUV does deliver a great product for what you spend. Love that this RDX came with standard things like power lift gate, sunroof, etc. that most other manufacturers charge. We love the practical setup of the instruments. Granted it’s seems a lil archaic in this day of touchscreens and such but it’s simple and safer for eyes on the road. iPhone 8 works ok for pandora and music. Every now and then it will require a reattaching of the usb cable to clear up an error. Bluetooth works well for calls and audio. But a problem persists with loading my phone book which is annoying. Text option isn’t compatible another downer. But all in all it’s a decent base system. Oh and also the subwoofer if you call it that is a joke. Barely audible lows. The comfort is great Plenty of space for 5. Flat rear floor which is great. Leatherette feels ok just cross fingers it lasts. Enter and exit very easy, doors open just wide enough. Cargo space is typical. Love the power lift gate especially when you got your hands full. Powertrain is awesome. Has great power when needed. The 6 banger of yesteryear is an oldie but a goodie. Turbo 4’s are the rave with minimal mpg gains. Our engine seems like it’s bulletproof and will last. I typically get 28-29 highway and 25-26 mpg mixed driving. Plus it’s premium recommended not required, another plus. The old 6 speed shifts smoothly and paddle shifters don’t add any excitement just a “neat” feature. Love the headlights. I travel primarily dark 2 lane highways and owe it to the LED lights for saving a few furry road obstacles and damage. It has a significant cutoff that doesn’t bother until I get into hilly roads. Road noise isn’t an issue. Pretty good but don’t expect a vault silent ride. The ride is well composed and might I say a lil fun when on twisty roads. Handles well for an SUV. As far as issues or problems that take us to the shop? None. This may be the last of the stalwart Acura’s for the time being. Mechanically it’s stout. Just simple and cheap maintenance. All power options thumbs up. No rattles, leaks, or things coming apart. The paint/finish looks good but compared to my wife’s  one year older Lexus, well let’s just say it’s not as glossy and rich in color. We want to keep this for a long time and are confident it will last for that. Honda needs to get back on the saddle as far as reliable vehicles in their Acura division. I sure hope so because eventually we will need another RDX in the distant future.

acura,rdx,2017,Gary, 02/21/2017,Blows my former Lexus NXt200 Away,pos,"I owned a Lexus NXt200 for the last two years and have been a Lexus guy for 20 years. Still love their cars. However, I have been driving the  the RDX for the last two months and can definitively say it is far and away a better car than the NXt for my money. In short: the RDX interior feels more luxurious; acceleration is much smoother; car is quieter; and the technology such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure and blind spot monitoring make long trips much less stressful. You almost feel like you are a pilot monitoring a plane on auto pilot versus constantly turning cruise control on and off and fighting your way through traffic. It's more like you glide your way through traffic on the interstate. Of course, no car is perfect and there is still room for tweaks and improvements. For example, if you are on the interstate in the left lane and going around a long curve the car senses the the car ahead of you in the right lane is actually in front of you and slows down unnecessarily. But this is a rare and minor annoyance, especially compared the the raft of positive attributes this car possesses. I highly recommend you check it out during your due diligence period when shopping for a mid-size SUV. I am extremely happy I did.

acura,rdx,2017,Happy RDX owner!, 08/14/2017,So glad we bought this car,pos,"Update #3:  Our RDX now has over 80,000 miles on it (as of Sept 2020).  If someone tells you that a highly reliable, very enjoyable car with great safety can't be made in the U.S., they would be incorrect.  Not a single repair.  This car was built in the U.S.  Given our ever changing world, I am just so glad to support a good management team along with the U.S.-based people that built and maintain this car.  I am hopeful Acura will follow a similar path as Porsche, and return the RDX to six-cylinder power.  This car has plenty, plenty of torque and horsepower.  Although it continues to get in excess of 30mpg on the highway, it would be great for a new RDX to get better mileage than this one or also the current, new RDX.  As a bit of a sidenote, the original equipment Michelin tires lasted more than 60,000 miles.  Since most of my time now in the car is highway commuting and I prefer to listen to the radio, I am even more glad for the high quality stereo.

Update #2:  Our RDX now has over 51,000 miles on it (as of Sept 2019), and we remain completely satisfied with this car.  

We have used two Acura dealers for servicing, which has worked extremely well and been a pleasant surprise.  I started taking it to the dealer for maintenance only to ensure the Certified Preowned Warranty was complied with - I'm now comfortable with the two local Acura dealers, unlike almost all other car dealers.  

At this point, I'm glad we had the tires rotated several times in the past.  Best I can tell the OEM Michelin tires will still go another few thousand miles before needing replacement.  Acura has done a great job with the design, construction, and ongoing support of this vehicle.  

Update:  We are now 10 months into our ownership of this car.  Since then, two other family members have bought or leased new Acura SUVs based on our favorable experience.  We use the car quite a bit.  It will probably have around 23,000 miles by the end of our first yr of ownership.  We bought it certified pre-owned with about 3,000 miles already on it.  I still very strongly believe we bought the best and right car for us and our needs.  Haven't had any repair needs.  I regret having the tires & wheels rotated - the car now has a very, very slight pull to it, which didn't exist before the tire rotation.  With the car being 4WD, I should have been much less concerned about tire rotation.  Overall, though, this is just a great car.  Encourage you to read my further notes below, as I don't have any revisions to my earlier comments.  Thank you Acura!

We are about six months into our ownership of a '17 Acura RDX AWD with the Technology package.  We also strongly considered a Volvo V70 Cross Country, RAV4 Hybrid, and a Chevrolet Impala.  V70 doesn't have near the rear seat leg room that the RDX has, which was important for us since we have taller teenagers.  Impala would have been a solid choice for us as well.  Also strongly considered a RAV4Hybrid; not sure you can tow anything behind it due to the hybrid drivetrain?  Definitely like the controls in the RDX - seem notably better than even those in the new MDX.  Upgraded stereo with HD radio was well worth it.  Very thankful for the generous cargo capacity behind the rear seats.  We had a hitch installed at the dealer.  Although the towing capacity is not high, it certainly expanded the usefulness of the vehicle.  This thing is truly a Sport Utility Vehicle in the best sense of the category.  The drivetrain is just awesome.  To get somewhere around 30 mpg on the highway with that amount of power available (and safety) is amazing.  Transmission shifts extremely smoothly.  If I could choose one upgrade for this car in the future, it would be for either an ""eco mode"" that shifts the transmission sooner, thus saving on gas, or an extra gear in the transmission for less consumption on the highway.  One other suggestion:
  a buzzer should automatically sound immediately if the car is put into gear with the parking brake set.  There have been two instances where I put the car in reverse and started to back out of a parking space with the parking brake on.  I only got a few feet before the warning was sounded, but makes no sense why this warning wouldn't take place sooner.  Another important point:  this car is made in the USA!

acura,rdx,2017,Be Pivirotto, 10/31/2016,RDX - Outstanding value with Class,pos,"Really enjoy the RDX and compared to my brothers Lexus, it blows it out of the water.  Instrumentation is the only negative as it is very confusing and not easy to intuitively understand the functions.  The split screens are also confusing and should be combined into one screen and not the dual screen method as of now.  Ride, handling, safefy features such as lane departure and lane departure assist are outstanding!  So glad I decided on the RDX.

acura,rdx,2017,Broka, 05/02/2017,2nd better than the 1st,pos,"This is my 2nd RDX and my 4th Acura. My 2015 RDX came off lease and I turned in for a 2017 AWD Advance and it is awesome. I loved my 2015 but this one is even better. The LED lights are unreal and they fixed all the problems I did not like with the 2015 (no vents in rear, passenger seat that goes up and down, ...) Little stuff but they add up. This one even has ventilated seats (Cool)!!! But I do notice a difference in the ride. It feels heavier, more solid, more powerful, smoother. Once set up, the touch screen is great. I spent a long time looking and checking out ALL of the competition from Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Jaguar, Range Rover, Jeep, Subaru, ... Perhaps it is not the sportiest but it is just as fast without the noise as any of the others with their turbo 4's and it holds the road beautifully. And its roomy too!! Definitely the right choice.

acura,rdx,2017,Marv, 06/08/2017,Like this suv,pos,"We looked at other suv's, found that the Acura had a better price with more opptions. The V6 engine has plenty of power & the transmission works great. We took a long road trip through Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Colorado, Utah & Nevada back to Cal. The car ran great with no problems going over all the mountains. I would recommend an Acura to anyone wanting a mid sized suv

The acceleration is so bad.. slow acceleration around town at 2000 rpm the transmission stutter, shutters, pretty much feels like it cannot get to the next gear.

acura,rdx,2017,Sharat Patro, 02/10/2017,2017 RDX with technology pkg,pos,"It turned out to be just an OK SUV.  The fit and finish is not on par with other luxury vehicle's of the same category.  There seems to be some rattling and squeak issues.  So far I have put about 2500 miles mostly highway.  Gives decent mileage for a V6 engine.

Update after 26000 miles - A reliable vehicle with plastic rattle and squeak issues.  Getting about 28 mpg combined with premium octane fuel.

acura,rdx,2017,Tom, 07/08/2017,""" Catch a '17 before there gone""",pos,"I did extensive research on smaller/midsize SUV's. I concluded the Audi Q5 and BMW 3 were not much better, seemed smaller, although specs don't back that up, and simply not worth the added cost. It came down to the Ford Edge Titanium with301 package with V6 in white and RDX with Advance Package. Liked the extra cargo space of the Edge and thought it was a very quiet comfortable ride. The bottom line negatives were poor Ford resale value versus the RDX, the lower gas mileage with the V6, the Sony sound system and ""slightly"" less interior quality. When Acura announced 2017 clearance prices last month, I was able to get one for the same price as the loaded Edge. I have driven now for 3 weeks and I am very satisfied with my decision. The infotainment system is a little hard to get used to but I am finding that the overall technology used in the Acura is really quite amazing. The engine does not hesitate like the Edge V6 also. Get the great price on 17's right now!

acura,rdx,2017,Skip Harvey, 10/13/2017,2017 Acura RDX,pos,"SUV has been reliable and comfortable after 20k and 3.5 yrs.  No service needed other than the navigation and tech voice interface are worst I've ever had and same as Honda which was very poor - still no updates to improve system.  Gas mileage is less than window sticker at average 18 mpg but acceptable for V6 that is smooth and peppy.  Time to get a replacement - wont be another Honda just due to voice/nav system.
"
acura,rdx,2017,New Car Owner, 09/18/2016,"Get an RDX, Can't Lose",pos,"Using the navigation system is not intuitive and can be a bit clunky.  Everything else is quite good.
The only downside so far has been the factory installed car alarm.   When loud cars pass by the alarm keeps going off.   I took it to the dealer to try to get the settings adjusted but when they said I had to leave the car there for the day just to adjust it, I just left.   It's gone off at least a hundred times so it is a bit if a nuisance.

acura,rdx,2017,Angry Acura Customer , 08/15/2019,Jerking Transmission Issues I Wil Never Buy Again!,neg,"I have traded this car.  Acura fixed the issues with the car after many tries but I was not happy with the customer service I received from. The local dealership was not a problem,  it was Acura customer service. 
I traded it and will never buy another Acura. 

I bought a 2017 RDX was very happy at first.  Stylish comfortable SUV. Then at 30,000 miles the car suddenly started jerking when accelerating from a stop.  Been in the shop st Acura 3 times.  Told it was fixed but now started doing it again.  An added bonus is now my check transmission light,  lane change error light,  flashing D light,  and emissions light all came on.  At this point I feel that the class I expected at this price point and Acura name was misguided at best.  I had better luck with cheaper model cars. So as of right now I am scared to drive my  newer vehicle very far. And yet again have to take it back to the dealership.

acura,rdx,2017,Rich, 12/08/2016,Great SUV,pos,"I went from a 2013 CRV and I love the 2017 RDX.  It has a nice quiet comfortable ride with plenty of leg room in front and back.  The V6 is very smooth and has some get up and go.  I love all the safety features in the advanced package.  I really like the navigation and being able to send destinations from your phone to your car navigation and calling Acura link to find a destination while driving.  The only thing lacking is there is no remote start option on the app and no heated steering wheel.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Rich, 09/04/2017,Nav system and Acura watch are totally worthless.,neu,"Nav system is terrible. Multiple steps to perform the simplest function. Voice recognition is so poor it's almost amusing to see what they come up with. Phone system is almost as bad. I've given up and use my own phone for navigation if I want no problems. Acura should refund the cost.               Front seats are short and hard like sitting on bleachers.  Ergonomics are joke.

"
acura,rdx,2017,TiggerEsqOC, 05/19/2017,So far - Great,pos,"So far this car is what I expected.  It is a good value which is the main reason I chose it.  I wanted a small SUV but not too small, with good MPG and some creature comforts.  My base with Acura Watch Plus does not have navigation, which I did want but it also doesn't have some of the custom ability that I would like and am used to.  Such as unlocking all doors when unlocking one, the passenger seat only has 4-way adjustment.  The acceleration is good, and it has the power I need.  I was driving a $60k Audi Q5 as a loaner before I got the Acura RDX, and that was an amazing car, but I didn't have $60k to spend on a car, for the price difference (I paid $34,000) it is a great option.
*Update - my review above is still accurate.  I now carpool with three teens, the car is comfortable for them. 
*Update 11/22/18 - Car is really perfect for what I need.  I wouldn't call it fancy, there are much more ""tech"" available on other cars but what it has is fine.  The only complaint which would be an easy change is to be able to program the all doors to unlock when I unlock one.  The Pleather seats hold up well to a German Shepherd and a Corgi mutt.

acura,rdx,2017,Nice G, 12/30/2017,Never again!,neg,"Purchased 17' CPO RDX Tech AWD with 9900 miles on it from paragon acura. (CPO is a joke!) Few days later noticed a tapping noise coming from the engine compartment. Took it to one of the local dealers. I had to leave my CPO(!!!) car there for 14 days for Torque Converter replacement. Done. The tapping noise is gone. Great. ... Now I got a few new problems: 1. Upshifting hesitation  @ 20 mph.  2. Rough downshifting @ 20 mph. 3. Feel a jerk just before it comes to a complete stop. Will take it back to them next week. As soon as I got out from the dealer decided to check on their work...oh my... Drivers side mirror scratched, plastic engine cover under the hood was not secured- just left loose on the engine, 4 plastic clips are missing on under-the-hood panels. So much for 2017 acura CPO junk... Never again.

acura,rdx,2017,Denise, 04/18/2017,Great luxury SUV for the money,pos,"I love this car. It has the space and height of an SUV, but drives like a car. The standard features are better than all of the competitors. Acura service is also top notch. They go out of their way to help and accommodate you when you bring the car in for maintenence.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Albert Zack, 01/05/2017,Not a lot of bells and whistles for a luxury brand,neu,"Even though we got the base RDX model, I was really surprised that to see the CRV from Honda (Acura's sister company) had some features the RDX did not.  From my perspective, the base RDX should have more features than the highest-end CRV considering the Acura higher end positioning.  Overall, we like the car, but just disappointed on how Acura cut corners.

The transmission shift is clunky.  I expected much better gas mileage but the around town is a Killer.  Looks good, easy to get around in and park.  When you get out of either side, your foot hits the threshold and it gets dirty and stained really fast.  Mine is a light color and looks nasty already

acura,rdx,2017,Kleo77, 02/27/2017,Not flashy but drives great!,pos,"It's been a long road till I pulled a triggered and leased 2017 base model AWD RDX. I also looked at BMW x1 & x3 and infinity Qx30 & QX50. Acura was a winner due to the best deal and dealership experience. I traded in my 2011 3 series that I loved but the CPO warranty was about to expire and I refuse to pay for fixing cars so in order to prevent it I decided to get a new car. I wanted awd because we go often to the mountains. I did not want the technology package because I hate having too many buttons and features even though I'm very computer savvy. I just assume that simple solutions are always the best. My fiancee got x3, retail price 10k more- it was a demo so its fully loaded but my car drives almost as nice as his and mine gets better gas milage even though his is 4 cylinder turbo. I got 22 freeway and 20 combined which is exactly the same as my beemer and better than my 2011 AWD Nissan Rogue! I consider that very good and I hope it will stay at this level (BTW unlike most people I do manual gas milage calculation every time I go to the gas station and don't rely on the computer readings because they are hardly ever accurate- beemer was most accurate). My other car option was x1 since I've always liked but it would cost me still more than Acura and it is a much more smaller car. RDX is equivalent of x3 and is a perfect size for me. Base model had keyless entry, moonroof , heated seat and back up camera which is all nice to have. The drive quality is very good, X3 has a better suspension but is also a stiffer ride due to run flat tires and bigger rims. I was very dissapointed with how much my 3 series depreciate during my 3 years of ownership that I'm not longer their loyal customer. They also stopped offering free brakes in the first 4 years of ownership which was another bummer. ON top of everything I think their cars are kind of outdated looking so its time for major overhaul. I might consider the x3 in 3 years if they come up with the nice design. Not that my Acura is a hot looking car because its super bland but the deal i got justifies it. The lease on Acura and Infinity was much cheaper for a very simple reason - Japanese cars don't depreciate as much as German cars. Anyway RDX is great car and the only downside is there will be  anew model coming up soon thats why I opted to lease. Highly recommended, safe and efficient vehicle.

acura,rdx,2017,BobM, 10/23/2017,Missing the Mark Electronics,pos,"I have owned 8 Acuras over the past years always pleased with overall quality reliability and cost of ownership. However, my pet peeve is the interiors, they are skimping on the quality,  i.e using the imitation leather vinyl whatever it is it's tacky cheap. The Worst is the so-called carpet is the thinnest low pile, like the cheapest you can buy at a home deport for covering steps ugh!     The voice-activated Navigation and voice recognition for the phone is the absolute worst in the industry.     I frequently rent cars Ford GMC and Toyota all are superior. I speak clearly precisely and it doesn't recognize me or my spouse's  or others commands or comments. Yes, it's frustrating.  This joke of voice recognition is like speaking to a deaf-mute, it is horrible not even worth having it  The overall experience is now negative. The one other major issue is the phony chrome ring around the AC vent outlet next to the doors reflect directly into the outside mirrors how stupid is this  Honestly it's a major distraction on a critical safety device.    Time to wake up Acura and step up your game to keep me,   I'm going to Lexas 
Update dealer changed out the vent to solid black. Mirror problem is fixed thank you. 
The Navigation stil the worst
I don’t even use it I use my iPhone

Why
Because all you say is directions and the address and it finds it and takes you there without any hassle using the Acura navigation system is like talking to a dummy it only understand specific commands it does not understand or can adapt to different voices .
Much much worse is someone sitting in the passenger seat can’t even punch in the commands because it won’t let you do it while you’re moving so you have to stop your car and spend 15 minutes programming all the information manually . That’s  not convenient that’s absolute absurdity
Wake up Acura

acura,rdx,2017,Lulu, 07/20/2020,My Dream Car!!!!!,pos,"So I have been looking into cars for a while and I found the Acura RDX. My family wanted me to get an suv because they feel they are safer than sedans. I thought this was a good car since its not too big. I was also looking at the Nissan Rogue, toyota rav 4 and honda crv. The style of the other cars just was not as appealing in my opinion. So I narrowed it down to the 2017 Acura RDX in white with black interior. I watched so many car videos and reviews on this car and all I can say is that I am so happy I got this car. Since COVID19 is going on I was not able to go into the dealership and had to rely solely on videos I saw and trust what the reviews and test drivers said about the car. So I kind of took a big gamble choosing this car but everything worked out! It is perfect. I ordered it from Carvana and it was delievered to my house. I drove it for the first time today and woww!!! It so sporty and light, so easy to drive I love it. I am so used to driving my mom's car which is a mazda cx9 so it is a lot bigger and heavier. However, this car is so much fun to drive and its perfect. I am also nineteen so I think this was the perfect small suv for me. An affordable luxury car. I would 100 percent recommend this car to anyone looking for a new car!

I agree with Edmunds review that it is quick to brake when there is plenty of space that does not require the over reaction.  Love the dual screen and while there is a learning curve on the navigation,  my phone app has a better navigation then what Acura provides.  Still.  It's not a deal breaker and I look forward to when I get to drive my car- which is a first for me.  Definitely a smooth, quiet ride.  And very comfortable on all fronts.  Just love it.

acura,rdx,2017,Nor Cal Driver, 05/27/2019,Decent car with some odd issues,neu,"Bought with 10k miles after reading lots of reviews. Engine is powerful, but transmission isn’t very fun, sport mode pretty much unusable. Weird rattle from steering wheel that I just found out has a service bulletin on it from Acura so will need to get that fixed. Safety features sound good but adaptive cruise control over reacts and is pretty annoying. The blind spot works great though as does the emergency braking. Makes a squeaking noise when driving at slower speeds in front brake area.  
Pulls slightly to the right when driving, might just be alignment issue. For the price I was expecting less issues. Super comfortable seats and great acceleration. Good amount of space inside when you need it. Kind of hard to park in tight places like parking garages as it’s kind of wide, and turning radius isn’t great. 
Performed ok in the snow, not amazing or as good as my Subaru did. 

Overall I would not recommend this car. I definitely regret buying it. It’s just not very fun to drive. Neither sporty or that utilitarian. For some people I think it would be a good vehicle for some, just not for me.

Dealer had to replace a wiring harness to fix the problem. Got the car back and now the Radio does not work properly. It sounds ok for a while and then the music sounds tinny like the bass was turned off. the satellite link for radio is terrible. Navigation is difficult to use and often send us out of the way. The voice commands is sketchy at best. Locking the doors on the car is tricky - if you press it twice too close together, the windows and roof open! The Hands Free isn't very adaptive. My 5'10"" husband has a great deal of difficulty getting in and out of the car... it is very tight. If you start the car top gear out and walk around to the other side, you can't open the other doors or tailgate. You have to walk around top the driver side and unlock from there.  PROS: the back seat covers are fitted perfectly.

acura,rdx,2017,Bruno Weis, 06/16/2019,Up graded CRV,pos,"Previously owned 2 Honda CRV- RDX Is  a pleasant, up graded Honda CRV, reliable, interior noise from road and wind, annoying as is mpg. Navigation was very disappointing- not user friendly. Considered a new and touted, great  RDX improvement but dealers were not discounting nearly as effectively as Lexus, and Cadillac.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Richard Meltz, 04/23/2017,Design Defect- Do not Buy,neg,"We leased a fully loaded Acura RDX and are very disappointed. There is a clear design defect that Acura dealers deny even knowing about. When driving the side view mirrors show a glare from  the air conditioning vents. This is because the vents contain a silver metal design and the sun shows the glare on the side view window. It is more than annoying and is a distraction. When we called the dealers, they claim not to know about it. We even spent money to tint windows, but this failed to help. In calling around to other dealers, we contacted one out of state who acknowledged it was an issue. This dealer said they were changing the vents by inserting a black rim in place of the silver one. Thus, you can now enjoy a far lower priced Honda instead of an Acura!!!  Calls to Acura customer service have not been returned as promised. Also, my wife's foot cramps when driving because the pedals are too high. Others have complained about it according to another dealer I spoke with. The Navigation is cumbersome, difficult and voice recognition is terrible. It is hit and miss unless you always want the date. Any other info? forget it. I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone and am surprised that Acura hides these issues. I will try to get out of my lease because of these issues.

acura,rdx,2017,William Hall, 09/02/2016,New Acura RDX,pos,"Just finished driving this car on two long trips. First trip was a 2000 mile Florida trip in the spring. The second trip was a 2 month, 9000 mile trip to western National Parks. The RDX performed great on both trips. I was impressed at the comfort of both the driver and passenger seats for long Interstate driving.  Gas mileage was very good on the open highway at 27+ MPG. The vehicle was loaded as full as we could get it and it handled the load very well. The RDX also performed well on mountain roads at altitudes up to 10000 feet elevation. Overall I am very satisfied with the RDX, but do wish it had a little more luggage space(guess I needed an MDX).
Two additional years and 20000 additional miles and vehicle still performed well. Changed tires at 35000 miles and only have performed normal maintenance. Recently had vehicle on 1800 mile trip and vehicle performed very well, mileage was over 27 mpg in mostly interstate driving. Only negative concern is that suspension starting to show some harshness to absorbing road bumps. Other than that performance is similar to new with no identified  problems.

I should mention that the RDX( 2017) is a fuel hog by comparison to my subaru legacy wagon with equivalent power.

I would suggest to Acura to focus on the customer need and skip ""cool"" electronic junk and instead build efficient, consumer friendly and intelligent designs.  Not something that they currently do.

It's VERY well made, responsive, provides many needed safety features, is incredibly spacious and was/is an excellent value. Maintenance required so far is just oil changes, tire rotations and a air/cabin filter change in the first two years. Huh, I guess I have learned something in 60 years.

acura,rdx,2017,W.T.Parker, 05/28/2018,Inside it's an upscale Honda,pos,"Honda is an engineering company first and foremost. Regardless of the product from rototillers to jet airplanes, whatever they make works and works well.  Yes, all cars break, some more than others, but for 40 years starting with Honda and then  Acura.  My last four Acuras never glitched once, same for my Hondas.  Moreover, you can judge a car company by how they handle recalls.  My last recall from Honda went perfect and was professionally fixed w/o a hassle.  For safety, reliability and style, I'll continue with Honda/Acura as long as their engineering and build remains excellent.  Lastly, resale is another consideration for owning a Honda product and to top it off, my RDX was made in the US.  That alone should be reason enough without even considering the lower cost to insure.

acura,rdx,2017,Stanley J., 08/07/2018,Glorified Honda,neu,"Seems overpriced for what you are getting.

acura,rdx,2017,Ken, 07/20/2020,Exactly what we needed,pos,"Bought this RDX used about 6 weeks ago, and have had a chance to drive it under multiple conditions. Overall we really like the RDX - it's just what we were looking for when downsizing from a 3-row SUV - no regrets moving to this slightly smaller SUV. The ride is very smooth, and the seating is comfortable in front and rear. Very fun to drive. V6 has plenty of pep. No blind spots. Technology and controls still take a little to get used to - NAV control is not intuitive (yet) and voice commands are a work in progress. One USB port? Seriously? Ventilated seats are a nice touch but can be a little loud. Overall these gripes are very minor in nature, and we're very satisfied with the RDX. Would recommend to a friend.

acura,rdx,2017,MAGA, 09/08/2020,Best value for midsize luxury SUV,pos,"You can't get a high-end SUV with all these standard equipment anywhere near this price. And Acura is one of the most reliable vehicles I've ever driven. The best part it is made in the USA :-)
"
acura,rdx,2017,Just Chuck , 10/22/2020,Great except for harsh ride,pos,"Just picked up a CPO '17 RDX six weeks ago. I've taken it on to two trips into the city, about eighty miles roundtrip each, one trip to another city: that was about 300 highway miles roundtrip, and driven it about 500 miles around crowded suburbs running errands. I've put about 1000 miles on it in six weeks. Happy overall, but the ride is harsh. Even with tire pressure at just 30 PSI, every bump is felt. Cross shopped the Lexus NX, have a Lexus RX also, and was turned off by the NX's tight, narrow cockpit. The Acura feels significantly higher up and wider inside than the NX. Power is great, tech is mostly good. I don't use any vehicle's navigation system, but I did try this one around an unfamiliar city with some people who knew where we were going, and they told me it was bad. Took us on a longer route than necessary. Other than that, seats are good, sound system is good, steering feels numb but handling is very good. A little nitpicking- I like that on my RX the mirrors fold in when the car is locked, the RDX does not have that. I did get the top of the line Advance Package, and that was another selling point here- ventilated seats, collision mitigation, top of the line sound system, lane departure warning- which is annoying as it picks up the back wheel near the line on curves. I turned off that Lane Departure. It also has Lane Keeping Assist, which is supposed to gently move the wheel to follow the lines in the road. I can't say that I feel it doing much of anything. Adaptive cruise control is a nice feature, if you have traffic light enough to really use it for a long time. Headlights are very good. Seats are good, but not up to Lexus RX standards. Overall, I   hoped I was getting a another Lexus RX but on a 4/5ths scale. This is not that. It's good, competent, and overall a fine choice, but it's not buttery smooth like the RX, or as comfortable. My only tip to you would be to look for one with the Advance Package, and get all the bells and whistles. My vehicle with under 25,000 miles on it was $28,000 plus tax and tags, the same price as the lower trim line models that were a year newer and had similar miles. Obviously the year matters little when buying used and planning to keep a long time. It's well worth it to look for the Advance Package for the ventilated seats, adaptive cruise control, and upgraded sound system alone. So, I'd buy it again, but again, look for the Advance Package, which is hard to find. It seems only about one out of every 20 or 30 cars are loaded up this way.

acura,rdx,2018,Optionier, 12/17/2017,Happy Camper,pos,"Came from a BMW X-3 that I had been driving since purchasing new in 2011. The RDX is an easier daily driver. I had been driving on run flat tires for so long I had forgotten how bad they are. The RDX is simply more comfortable over all road conditions. Test drove the 2018 X-3 and was disappointed in the BMW’s turbo 4 pot. Even though it had good acceleration it’s still displays an economy car feel, sound and characteristics. Visibility is super, comfort is excellent. Just finished a 650 mile road trip that I had taken many times in the X-3 and felt more comfortable and much less fatigued in the RDX. Throw in at least $10,000 lower price than a similarly  equipped X-3 and I’m simply a happy camper.

We have driven Honda's / Acura's for over 30 years and are well-pleased with their consistent quality.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Bill Kramer, 08/21/2018,2018 RDX TECH PACKAGE,pos,"We bought the car for my wife’s daily driving and long trips. We compared the 2018 RDX with the tech package to a 2019 RDX with tech package, CRV, RAV4, and an Audi. While the 2018 doesn’t have all of the bells and whistles, i.e. Apple play. It had more than enough. The 6 cylinder normally aspirated engine with the 6 speed tranny are more than adequate. It’s quick and handles great. We especially like the the split screens. We have NAV and music choices going on separate screens and don’t find them distracting at all. Oh and did I mention it was about 10,000 + dollars cheaper than the Audi, BMW, or the 2019 RDX. All in all great value and great fun to drive.
"
acura,rdx,2018,jrasero, 03/01/2018,Awesome SUV that is a bit long in the tooth,pos,"While the RDX 2nd gen has been around since 2013 the car has aged well and received a nice mid cycle refresh in 2016.  The car is basically unchanged for 2018 and with the 3rd gen 2019 RDX on its way this summer you probably can score a good deal on a current gen or get one if you refuse to adopt to a high speed transmission w/ a turbo engine.  One of the best parts of the 2nd gen RDX is the bullet proof 6 speed transmission paired to the 3.5L V6 engine, that has 279 hp and 252 lb-ft of toque, which means a healthy amount of instant power to the wheels.  The car emits a healthy growl and is equipped with VCM so even with a V6 the RDX's 19/27 MPG is very respectable since a Lexus NX 200t AWD w/ a 4 cylinder turbo gets 22/28 MPG.  Even though most luxury compact crossovers are oriented for utility and comfort it's sad that Acura omitted SH-AWD from the 2nd gen.  The basic AWD system is fine and probably more than enough in most situations, but Acura's SH-AWD system is almost equal to Audi's Quattro system and it could have helped in acceleration since the RDX does suffer from some wheel squeal.  I mostly cross shopped the RDX against the Lexus NX 200t AWD and while the Lexus just is more luxurious and offers more high end features it can costs thousands more than a RDX, it lacks the cargo/utility of an Acura, and noise wise it is louder, which is odd to say about a Lexus.  The top of the line Advance trim offers some nice features as nice rims, heated & ventilated seats, remote engine start, rain-sensing windshield wipers, fog lights, and front and rear parking sensors but still lacks Android/Apple compatibility, heated steering wheel, heated outboard seats, panoramic moon roof, high grain leather, thigh extenders, wireless charging, 360 cameras, plus the RDX lacks some of the materials associated with a luxury car.  If these aforementioned features aren't required than I think the RDX sits in between something like a loaded Honda CR-V and a Buick Envision, Infiniti QX50, Volvo XC60.  RDX's resale and reliability are top notch and compared to German cars Acura maintenance is considered normal to even cheap.  Acura recommends premium fuel but regular does just fine.  The trim I wouldn't recommend at minimum to get is the Tech package since it provides sports seats w/ perforated leather, 8 way front passenger seat, on demand multi use display, voice recognition for Nav and Climate, navigation, AcuraLink, Real Time Traffic, ELS audio system, Siri Eyes Free, Blind Spot Info, Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.  Overall the 2018 RDX is a very good car and really its biggest issue is that feature wise it falls behind the pack, but if you don't need the latest and greatest and want something that has a luxury caché and has a V6 engine with a smooth a quiet ride there aren't really many choices besides the RDX.

acura,rdx,2018,Tim Peters, 07/11/2018,Great ride and versatile vehicle!,pos,"I was driving a 2015 Acura TLX sedan. We moved to a new home that lies on a ridge at the top of a steep drive. After the first snow I realized we needed an AWD vehicle. I did not want to give up the precision, technology or the fun factor of my TLX but I knew that I needed something that had AWD and sat higher off the ground while still offering the precision, technology and the fun factor of my TLX. The RDX provides all of these qualities. The transmission is very smooth (more so than my TLX) and the 279 HP V6 is responsive and quick. The ride is quiet and comfortable, yet has responsive handling and steering. It has a sport mode with paddle shifters like my former TLX. The AWD system sends 50% of the torque to the rear wheels when needed. More than enough to navigate a snow covered steep drive. The voice controlled audio, navigation and climate control are top notch and the Siri hands free option works great. Cargo room is great for a five passenger SUV as is the fit and finish. Lane keep assistance and auto sensing speed cruise control make longer trips less tiring. Highly recommend this vehicle.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Jim from St.Paul, 08/03/2018,Great Ride - revisited,neu,"We’re coming up now on 10,000 miles, and the more I drive this SUV, the more I like it.  It does the little things well... it knows your seat memory settings by your key fob.  You step into the car and it adjusts automatically.  We have the Advance package, and we’re really enjoying the ventilated seats, rain sensing wipers, and the ELS sound system.  Cargo space for hauling is as roomy as my Subaru Outback, and the all wheel drive is just as good in snow and primitive trail conditions.

If you are a big “need connectivity to my phone” kind of person, this isn’t the car for you.  Bluetooth works well but the screens look dated - like an older version of Windows.  That said, it is understated luxury - it’s not a sexy BMW nameplate, but we didn’t care about that.  If you want creature comforts that come with a premium brand combined with excellent reliability, this is your car.

acura,rdx,2018,E.K., 01/20/2018,Great buy,pos,"I 've only had my SUV a month and I love it. It handles well in the freezing rain. Everything about it is great except for acceleration from starting point. Also it uses 91 octane or higher which is more costly. I find I have to go to gas up more often although I don't let it go below 1/4 of a tank. I drive a lot and don't want to run out in the middle of nowhere. Overall I think this is a good automobile and am enjoying it a whole lot. I would  buy another.

acura,rdx,2018,JKF, 07/23/2018,Satisfied Customer,pos,"Based on a month of having this car, very satisfied with it so far. Pluses, in my opinion, include strong and smooth V6, 6 speed automatic transmission, smooth and comfortable ride, and it gets gas mileage in line with the sticker ratings. Also, I like the volume and tuning knobs for the radio. Have a 2016 Honda CR-V, as well, and it does not have the radio control knobs, just some buttons to try to find while driving. The Honda does have a right side camera in the mirror, but the Acura does not...kind of surprising. Good deals available now on the 2018 since a restyled  2019 is out on the lots.

acura,rdx,2018,Tony Lee, 09/02/2018,Best vehicle ever own,pos,"I just traded in my 2014 CRV for a 2018 RDX Basic AWD. I love this car because it had the same simple controls as my CRV.  I beat myself for not buying this sooner.  I didn't like the 2018 CRV because of the Turbo & SVT, I couldn't careless about MPG. nor premium fuel.  I test drove but didn't like the following on the 2019 RDX : Turbo, SVT, nice looking console and interior, but complicated entertainment controls. I do wish I have SH-AWD on the 2018 (Another one of those MPG related item from Honda Corporate philosphy). My 2018 RDX has plenty of power, comfortable seats and firm ride, best headlights, excellent brake, air conditioning, .good AWD in snow.  I drive my RDX with confidence and not worry about a steep hill. The only thing I didn't like were the useless pedal shifter and the small gas tank.
I owned this car for over 2 years. It is still the best car I ever owned with no problem whatsoever. It was always a pleasure to take it to a long trip. I would add that the normal maintenance of this car is not that cheap."
acura,rdx,2018,N1128Q, 10/17/2017,Good Vehicle But Not a Luxury Ride,neg,"The 2018 RDX is good but basically a Honda with some nice touches and a different grill. I've leased Audi vehicles for several years but decided to go with the Acura because the 2018 Audi Q5's lease quote was about $100/month higher for a similarly equipped vehicle. After driving the RDX for a couple of months, I can see why. The difference in interior materials, engineering, and overall luxury show that the Audi is far better. In particular, I'm disappointed in the assembly quality. Exterior panels have uneven gaps, bolts and screws are visible, and there are other areas that show that Honda took assembly and materials shortcuts which a ""luxury"" brand should not do. In addition, the dealership experience left a lot to be desired as the RDX was not prepped correctly, tires were over-inflated, the front license plate bracket was not attached, and (not to sound petty but this goes to the ""experience"" factor) I did not receive a full tank of gas. When I said something to the salesman, he brushed it off. Since then, I have not heard from the dealer or from Acura - even to see if I'm enjoying the vehicle. Overall, I'll keep the RDX but think I'll go back to Audi for my next vehicle.

This is an update of the review I posted in October. Since then, my RDX developed squeaks, rattles, and buzzing that demonstrated the indifferent quality of assembly and the poor choice of materials. The voice recognition system got even worse and trying to work with it in traffic almost resulted in accidents on two occasions. While the navigation system could ultimately find the desired destination, it never chose the best or even safest route. The seats became more uncomfortable over time, to such an extent that my wife had to use a seat cushion to even sit in the vehicle for a drive longer than 30 minutes. Finally, at 7800 miles on the odometer I gave up, ""bit the financial bullet"", and got out of my lease. Acura may aspire to premium status but I know I'll never get another one. The materials, assembly, fit and finish, and technology are, at best, equal to Honda but at Lexus prices. My wife's Hyundai Elantra is a better vehicle than the Acura RDX.
"
acura,rdx,2018,domer, 05/24/2020,"This is a very, very good vehicle",pos,"I honestly don’t understand the critics of this vehicle.  It is quick and reasonably efficient - especially on the open road - nimble around town, spacious, reliable and a great value core the price.

Mine has 23,000 miles on it, and the only thing I might changed is to go with the AWD version.  The power easily overcomes the front wheel adhesion on quick starts, but with a little throttle modulation that is easily quelled,

I’ve owned a couple of BMW X3s, Two Audi Q5s (including a TDI, which is in a class by itself) and an Acura MDX.  The Acura RDX is a good as any of them, except possibly for the TDI.  I’m glad I bought it.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Pat Houge, 08/10/2017,VISABILITY,neu,"I just purchased the 2018 RDX Advance Package. This package comes with exterior side mirrors with a film on them which really distorts the driver's vision. It is especially bad on the driver's side where the mirror is divided to see far & near objects which is not necessary.  This film only appears on the Advance Package vehicles.  Due to the distraction & very poor visibility caused by these mirrors, Acura should issue a ""recall"" on these vehicles. On the 2018 vehicles this flaw was corrected.  Additionally, the interior appointment of this vehicle could be improved with a nicer dash, steering wheel, floor mats, etc. Also, the driver's seat will not push back far enough for my legs to feel comfortable & the driver’s seat is not comfortable. Consequently, I had to buy a seat cushion.  Additionally, the ride is far too rigid & stiff taking bumps in the road too harshly. This car rides more like a sports car rather than a fully loaded SUV. I would never recommend this SUV.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Greg, 10/29/2017,Had high hopes,neu,"With the glowing Edmunds review I thought this was the one.  Then we took it on a test drive.  The road noise was so bad that while on the highway you could not hear the person siting next to you with a normal speaking voice.  And, you had to almost scream to hear or be heard from the back seat.  Yes, the technology is great and with it being a Honda, the reliability would probably be excellent as well, but the interior noise just kills the deal.  Also, the rear seats are rather hard and not very comfortable.

acura,rdx,2018,Craig, 06/21/2019,RDX reliability is poor Engine mis-fire problems,neg,"Be aware that my RDX is a 2018 and is having random check engine lights which means an engine mis-fire.  my RDX has only 7,000 miles on it and is having a serious issue.  the Engine mis-fire issue is pouring raw fuel (un-spent) into the exhaust system which could lead to a fire.    The immediate action was to stop driving the vehicle.  So now we have a new RDX that has been in the Acura dealer shop for nearly 5 days with no indication of whats causing this problem.  If we do get the car back i am now afraid to drive it due to this issue.  So be aware of the reliability issues we are experiencing with our Acura 2018 RDX.  This might be a one off but wanted to let others that may be thinking about an Acura RDX know of the problems we are having with a car kept in a garage, maintained and treated with white gloves on.

Have taken it three times from B.C. to Palm Springs and found the trips so much easier than my older Honda CRV.  It powers up mountain passes and cruised the long stretches of I5 so nicely.  Fuel costs were reasonable.
Many friends commented on the comfortable back seat and ride.
I hope to keep this vehicle for many more years.

acura,rdx,2018,Rtn, 07/28/2018,Nickel and dime you,neg,"Poorly designed vehicle, a true Frankencar. GPS sucks, Infocenter sucks, interior design sucks, A/C sucks.  On the exterior, every place possible will catch pine needles and debris to encourage rust.  Engine & chassis great, everything around these two aspects suck. Dealer installed roof rack was a waste of money.  The roof rack is some weird metallic silver, which does not match anything else color wise on the car.  Plus the roof rack cross bars are installed at angle so it looks like someone made a mistake (honest). The all wheel drive capabilities are truly limited unless you change to mud and snow tires for the winter, when it snowed here in Seattle I could not get out of the driveway.  The GPS is truly a boat anchor, as example if you enter Lowes Hardware it will provide you a choice to make between 846 Lowes stores.  Same is true for anything you enter, and you cannot tell which of the 846 to choose from because they all start with Lowes Hardware and no city information is readable, it is a real POS.  If you are brave to try the voice commands on the infocenter you will more than likely get the response there time is:

acura,rdx,2019,Petros Bezirganyan, 01/07/2019,Close to Being Perfect Compact Luxury SUV--Not The,pos,"After months of researching and shopping, pulled the trigger on new  RDX w/ Tech... After driving it for 3k mi in 2 months, here are my impressions.

THE GOOD

1. The leather seats are very soft and comfortable. Beats any latest model Nissan, Volvo or BMW. The real leather is exquisite.
Acura makes the best leather seats, period. Better than the latest Volvo XC90 or XC60, BMW X3 or 3 series, Nissans and even Hondas and Audi Q5... The only seat that is better is the one in Volkswagen Passat, but these are synthetic leatherette... The seat is 16-way power adjustable, and on Advance trim it has power thigh extension as well...
Love the seats...

2. The ELS 3D Studio premium audio system is sublime. The surround sound is fantastic, and is second only to Volvo's latest Bowers & Wilkins audio system.

3. The style. I really, really love the body styling if the new RDX. It is elegant, agresive, sporty, modern. I really love the 19"" shark gray wheels. The cabin is modern, luxurious and I would say, elegant. Love panorama sunroof.

4. Comfort and ride. Very quiet cabin, supple ride. Good rear legroom and headroom

5. Cargo capacity. Is on par with any compact SUV, and is better than almost all luxury compact SUVs.

6. Price point. Very competitive guven the amount of features.

7. Engine power and torque. With 272 hp on tap and low-RPM 280 lb-ft of torque, this SUV has a    pick-up of a sporty sedan or a hatchback.

8. Handling. With its wide stance and low profile, coupled with torque-vectoring all-wheel drive, this SUV corners flat, and can handle any curve confidently, feeling sure-footed on any type of pavement.

THE BAD

1. Transmission. Acura keeps telling us (since the crappy 6-speed in 2013 RDX and 8, and then 9-speed ZF transmission in Acura MDX 2013-2015, 2016-2019) that they are going to finally fix the rough and jerky gear shifts, especially at low speeds and going uphill, and finally they claimed that they did it with the Honda-engineered 10-speed transmission, debuted in the 2018 Honda Odyssey, and now in 2019 RDX...

But let me tell you, this tranny, although much better than 9-speed German-made ZF and the 6-speed in old RDX, still has some serious issues: at low speeds it tends to keep in the middle gears (3-6), instead of downshifting to 2, perhaps--I don't know, but the effect is as if it is in higher gear at lower speeds than it should be, preventing acceleration at speeds at around 25-30 mph, or when coasting to a stop light or parking... This is very annoying, since the vehicle feels underpowered for simple maneuvers, like coasting to a stop light or driving in a parking lot. Pushing the throttle, simply jerks the vehicle forward, as if accelerating from dead stop, which is not what one wants, and is dangerous in traffic or parking garages... Disappointing.

2. Fuel economy on premium 92 grade gas. In the mixed mostly city driving I average only 21 mpg on premium gas. Very disappointing. On regular 87 octane gas, the fuel economy drops to 20 mpg. Disappointing...

3. Small fuel tank, short driving range on a full tank. With only 17 gallon tank, maximum I can drive on premium gas on a full tank is 300 miles, before the fuel gauge light up. Very, very disappointing... My Nissan Rogue would go 359 miles before I had to stop for refueling...

4. Infotainment system. Very, very glitchy and underbaked. Using the precision touch mouse pad is awkward; using navigation is clunky. Voice recognition barely works. The loading of contacts takes a very, very long time... Calls are driooed every now and then; the system hangs intermittently... Nissan's simple Bosch-designed infotainment puts Acura to shame... Android auto is not supported as of yet... No way to look up point of interest phones; no Pandora or Google integration. My Nissan had all that. I miss Nissan's infotainment system...

THE UGLY

1. The brake pads already
 squeal on all 4 as if completely worn out on a brand-new vehicle with less than 3k miles!!!

2. Passenger wiper is not retracting completely. This is a calibration issue, which Acura is looking into.

3. The hatch back-door creaks and moans on opening and closing, just like a whale.

4. Driver vanity mirror cover squeaks when opening. Not nice.

5. The cargo area liftable cover does not stay open, and needs to be held while accessing the underfloor storage compartment.

6. To put in roof-rails and crossbars, Acura is asking for $1,200. Very expensive for almost a necessity on a SUV.

CONCLUSION

On hindsight, unless you are getting a super killer deal on 2019 RDX (e.g. below invoice), I do NOT recommend buying or leasing it, until Acura addresses transmission and fuel economy issues.

Also, note that it is a wide vehicle: 4-5 in wider than a regular sedan or a compact SUV. This may pose a challenge when parking in tight spaces.

acura,rdx,2019,Eva, 11/08/2018,I Traded-In My RDX After 7 Months Of Ownership,neg,"I had my “dream car” for 7 months and then traded it in for something more reliable. When I first purchased the Acura RDX Advance I was ecstatic. Everything seemed to be customized for me. From the memory seats to the technology, to the safety components. I was in love with my SUV. However, things seemed to go south the longer I owned the vehicle. First it was the constant issues with the Infotainment System. I would exit the vehicle and it wouldn’t turn off. I called the dealership and they either thought I was dumb and didn’t know how to operate a car, or they would say “this is the first time we’re hearing about this...” I found a site called AcuraZine which had a workaround for turning off the frozen system so I wouldn’t get a dead battery. So that was the first issue. The second was the constant brake squealing after about 3 or 4 months of ownership. I drive typically on the interstate, so nothing weird about my driving habits. The last, and most terrifying issue was the electronic issue. I was on my way to work, driving about 65 mph, and everything shut off except for the engine. So I had no dials (since they’re digital) / no GPS / no A/C nothing electronic whatsoever in my car. It was pitch black. I was in the middle lane and there was no way to pull over. I safely made it to work. When I placed the vehicle in park all electronics came back on but they were “strobing.” I called the dealership who told me to bring it in ASAP. After an hour they found nothing wrong and sent me on my merry way. This happened too many times for me to be comfortable with the reliability of the vehicle and the dealership never found any issues so I just traded it in for something more reliable and safe. I really wanted to love this car but for the price I paid (and the thousands of dollars I lost trading it in) it just wasn’t worth my safety. I hope this helps others.

acura,rdx,2019,Marianne Stolfi, 08/19/2018,Navigation system never worked.,pos,"From the first time I tried to use the navigation system it would not recognize the input address. I tried every method. ( It was the address for the Bethpage DMV!). I called my sales person and he walked me through the steps, it still did not recognize the address. I drove the car to the dealership. Another sales person tried to tell me that the problem was because Bethpage and Oyster Bay had the same zip code. (They don’t!). I tried to use the navigation to get to a friends house, it took me to a shopping center. I tried to use it to get to my home address. It tried to take me twenty blocks away. When I got fed up and called the service manager, he admitted that they were having problems with the new system and he didn’t know when it would be fixed. It is now over a month since I got the car!
"
acura,rdx,2019,Mark S of LI NY, 01/16/2019,Infotainment System Huge Disappointment,neu,"Own the 2019 RDX Advance since 8/13 . Before this I owned a 2014 RDX & before that 2010 TSX. I enjoy the handling, look (in & outside) & feel of the new RDX over the 2014 (2nd generation) Several over the air updates During my first year & 1/2 did had not corrected the quirks, concerns & non-function features of this new RDX talked about in a couple of forums. It was not until the most recent update did Acura solve nearly all the navigation problems.  The fee based ($110 year) AcruaLink app is quirky as well. They keep taking features away with disregard to its customers. Such as downloading directions when car is off & viewing tire PSI. By the way, subscribing to app is only way to remote start unless you pay nearly $500-&600 to dealer to install transponder. Crazy Acura did not incorporate it do need would be to just but a remote start key-bobb  

All means I Likely would not buy another Acura product in the future as Honda/ Acura should not have rolled out the new system before they had in working properly. I’m disappointed with them for not debugging the software before rolling it out to the consumer. Failing to do that, they had a OTA update in Feb. 2019 that messed up come features that had been working. I feel as if I’m part of a beta test. Its software is more than buggy.  

Even as the majority of infotainment system issues were corrected on most recent update it took them over 18-20 months after I bought it to address them. Though less of a concern they did not fix the issues pertaining to “Restaurants"" or ""Food"" or Shopping or Gifts as well as Travel Agency”; ALL of which are blank showing no data at all!!

acura,rdx,2019,Lynn, 11/05/2018,Trouble From Day One. Now a Lemon,neg,"I drove off the lot mid June only to notice 4 flaws before I got three blocks:  front windshield crazed between layers, visible only when sun directly on it,  Steering wheel unraveling, flaws in clearcoat on hood and faulty rear hatch.   After 4 weeks and a loaner for 13 days car seemed fixed and great—-until suddenly I had nothing on computer screen.  It’s now working again but frequent messages of LOADING which takes several minutes or FUNCTION NOT NOT AVAILABLE with steering wheel controls.  Often I drive miles with no access to screen as it spins.    Local dealer and corporate say an update is coming but nobody knows when.  I’ve waited 3 months now.   So now nearly 5 months in I have no horn.  Keeps blowing fuses and nobody knows why.  Car been in shop several days.  I’m afraid to drive too far from home for fear screen will go out again or I’ll have no horn. Other  problems include cracked battery cable, a mysterious mug rolling around under seat which was not mine.    Seat had to be removed to get it.  Leather on most seats is picked and I’m told it’s normal.  But no car in showroom is puckered like that.   I’ve been Honda and Acura owner 20 years.  Still have a perfect 2012 TSX.  But I’m done.  Poor quality and poor attitude from corporate in trying to get problems resolved.
UPDATE
It’s taken 4 months since filing Lemon Law Arbitration paperwork but my 2019 RDX is an official lemon and I’m awaiting buyback check.  The issues have been many since the day I left the dealership. I’ve posted before. But the horn that simply kept blowing fuses every time used and the constant malfunctioning Infotainment  issues put me at 84 days out of service and 26 trips to the dealer in 6 months. 
I’ve been shopping and sadly nothing duplicates the great look and handling and amenities for the price.  But I can’t go back. Not only do I fear another faulty vehicle but Acura treated this 20 year Honda and Acura owner terribly. At the hearing everything was my fault. I must use the horn too long or too often.  I do not but even if I did, so What!,   I must not see the obstacle when the collision mitigation engages on an empty road. The screen blinks because I must be using main headlights in the daytime. Seriously!!?? The 62 days out of service for the horn should not count because I could’ve driven the car with no horn.  Duh. That’s illegal. The cruise doesn’t work because I used it in the rain.  No. I showed videos of the malfunction on a sunny day. 
I still have to drive the car while awaiting settlement and no dealer will see me to reset my flashing screen. This helps for the short term.  Shame on Acura for the delays and treating me like an ignorant owner. My past 4 Honda and Acura vehicles never once saw a dealership but for maintenance.  I could list dozens of family members, neighbors, colleagues and friends who have made choices other than Honda products recently. Strangers stop me to see if I love the RDX. I tell them the truth. Had Acura come through with the buyback they said they were evaluating after 31 days out of service (legal definition of Lemon in FL), this would have ended better for all of us.  Hoping the money/car exchange happens soon so I can move on and take the road trips I had planned nearly a year ago.
The buyback finally took place in June - nearly a year after purchase.  Shame on Honda America for the stalling and the insults and the rude treatment at the final arbitration.  As a Honda/Acura owner for over 20 years I could not take an exchange.  Took the money and now I’m wonderfully happy in my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The computer is dependable and much more efficient than what Acura tried unsuccessfully to do in their 2019 RDX.

acura,rdx,2019,Krewman, 06/25/2018,"Great vehicle, but not perfect",pos,"Have put 1,000 miles on my new fully-loaded RDX. Love the ride, handling, and acceleration. Interior materials and seat comfort are excellent. Premium sound system is awesome (Last night, I sat in the car, ignition off, and blasted 70's rock and roll for an hour).  Love the heads-up display and ACC. There are, however, a few things that drive me nuts: 1) The nav system has a major flaw - you can't easily zoom the map in/out while guidance is in use. Sounds trivial. It's not. 2) Synching a phone does not provide access to the phone's contact list.  In fact the entire bluetooth/phone system is frustrating to use and poorly designed. Thank god for Apple CarPlay so you can just avoid the Acura system all together. 3) No place to put spare change except in the center console. Yes, it's a nit, but would it have killed them to add a small nook to keep coins?  4) The touch pad will make you insane the first few days. Then you get the hang of it and it's not too bad.  Still, Acura definitely needs to improve input approach.

**UPDATE**
I've driven the vehicle for over 13,000 miles. 

The Good: 
1) Acura updated the software so you can now zoom in/out when using the navigation system.
2) No mechanical issues. Trouble free.  Nice!

The Bad:
1) The nav system is still a mess. At times the turn arrow on the heads up display doesn't match the turn arrow on the dash display. For example, the heads up will have a arrow pointing to the left, while the display has an arrow pointing to the right. Bring a penny with you so you can flip a coin.  Second, using the voice command feature to enter in a destination is an exercise in frustration. You often get a ""destination not found"" or it misinterprets what you said and sets the destination to somewhere random. We actually play a game to see who can get the navigation system to set the most ridiculous destination. However, you can avoid the Acura nav system entirely by using Apple Carplay. Which brings me to item 2.

2) Apple CarPlay works. Then it doesn't. Then it does. Then it doesn't. It connects. Then disconnects. Then connects. Then disconnects. I have Apple Carplay on my other vehicles and it works fine with my iPhone, so the problem is with Acura. The workaround is to connect your iPhone to the vehicle using Bluetooth and then use Google Maps or Waze for navigation. You'll be limited to the iPhone screen, but at least the voice directions will play over the vehicle's  sound system (which, by the way, is awesome).

July 2020 update. 
If you have the heads up display there’s a fun game to play. Enter a destination into the navigation system. Then watch as the heads up display and the dashboard screen display completely DIFFERENT turn directions. So entertaining. 

As stated earlier, the electronics package on the vehicle (e.g., navigation, phone, radio, etc) is poorly designed and even after several updates is frustrating to use. 

To avoid these problems, just use Apple CarPlay. Oh wait, never mind, CarPlay only works intermittently. Like, hardly ever. 

Mechanically the vehicle is top notch. After 28,000 miles no repairs needed and no problems requiring dealer visits. Comfort and ride remain excellent.

acura,rdx,2019,Scott, 04/27/2019,Great Vehicle with One Serious Issue,neu,"Overall I enjoy the RDX but be aware there is an issue when under hard acceleration the engine may stall/lose power.  It’s happened to me twice in the 8 months I’ve owned it - both times on an interstate highway.  I was fortunate both times to make it to the shoulder without incident. Neither Acura nor the dealership admit to an issue but it’s serious enough that I won’t buy another until it’s resolved.   CarPlay still isn’t perfect as it randomly disconnects within the first few minutes of use but works well when it does stay connected.  It is annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Unhappy Acura Buyer, 03/18/2019,"Buyer's Remorse - Squeaks, Rattles, Glitchy!",neg,"Good Points - Awesome front seat comfort, stellar acceleration and handling.    Bad Points - Interior is quiet, EXCEPT for ALL interior squeaks and rattles that mostly cannot be located or stopped (I've resorted to stuffing folded business cards in seams where noise may be coming from, rear hatch rattles incessantly).  Transmission shifting at low speeds is unpredictable and RPMs stay at 3000-4000 before up-shifting killing city MPG, Apple Carplay crashes incessantly,  app for remote start works about 70% of time keeps asking me to re-register.  Accelerator lag is noticeable off the line every time (Acura - please  test-drive a Honda as they do not have lag issues).  Awful gas mileage - City MPG is 17, Interstate MPG is 24 on the best day.  My 2017 Honda CRV gets 24 MPG city and 31 MPG on the Interstate and no 93 octane required!  My 2018 V6 Honda Odyssey gets better MPG and transmission (reportedly same Honda sourced 10 gears) shifts much more smoothly and predictably.  Acura Dealer in Elmhurst Illinois is unable or unwilling to address interior squeaks and rattles......   Looking to trade-in this MISTAKE and to go back to a Mazda CX-5 which I had previously - better value, more interior road noise but no accelerator lag, smooth transmission, no squeaks and rattles.

acura,rdx,2019,Don't buy an RDX, 03/31/2019,So disappointed with my first Acura,neg,"This car is haunted!  The software needs so much improvement, and the dealership says they can't do a thing.  The radio comes on at will and often will not allow me to change channels.  Sometimes I can make phone calls, sometimes not.  The car has refused to go out of Park twice, so you can't go anywhere.  It has locked me out and has stopped in traffic twice.  All infotainment features work when they want to.  Sometimes I have no contact list and sometimes the car tells me it cannot perform the request, like make a phone call.  It is driving me crazy; I am always waiting for the next shoe to drop.  I have had it about 6 months and plan to trade it after a year.  It is a pretty car but does not perform reliably at all.  Even the mileage is not as predicted.  Every day it is something..................save your money and buy a decent car!

acura,rdx,2019,Scott Diedrich, 11/15/2018,I wish we could give our RDX back,neg,"After a month of ownership, with two weeks in the shop during this month, we are finally getting a new transmission for our RDX. Sadly they should be replacing the car considering the transmission started acting up with 30 miles on it, but instead have wasted weeks of our time and act like they are doing us a favor by replacing it. It would slam in to gear, feeling like it was skipping multiple gears at a time. Sometimes it would just hang up between gears, other times it would just rev up and not go before finally shifting in to gear. My favorite solution from the dealership was to just let the car warm up and auto start it and it won't be as bad. Granted, the issue was worse when the car was cold, but it also did it while warm. On a side note, letting the car idle in the driveway or garage does nothing to warm up the trans fluid, that only happens when the car is actually in motion and shifting. Confused looks on the face of the service adviser told me all I needed to know there. On the plus side, the loaner car drives nicely and shifts smoothly. Although the loaner car has a horrible infotainment system that lags and freezes constantly, at least mine doesn't do that. Maybe it will though when it's out of the shop, we can be so lucky!

acura,rdx,2019,Steve S., 07/25/2018,Too Soon!,neu,"Enjoyed it while I had it, but after driving less than 25 miles and owning for under 3 hours, the Infotainment center flashed between the home screen and “touchpad is not available.”  After restarting, the Infotainment center screen was completely dead.  Volume/power button on console didn't work.  Now in a loaner while dealer diagnoses the problem.  Highly disappointed with Acura quality control as this is not an isolated incident.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Faye, 02/09/2019,Car released too soon,neg,"After owning this car for 6 months, I'm very disappointed.  It's my first and last Acura.  On a regular basis, I notice the gears aren't shifting smoothly, or are delayed shifting so the engine revs in the 3000-4000 RPM range for no reason.  It's not every time I drive the car but once is enough.  It appears that this may be a common problem on this car reading other reviews.  Looming transmission replacement???  I've told the dealer and their only response was ""we'll make a note"".  Also, if you have an Android phone...beware.  This car's infotainment system doesn't work with an Android.  They told me in August it would be a few months and they expected software update to come out in November.  The update was published in January but still didn't address the the Android problem.  Now they are saying April...maybe.  For 5 months (before the January update), I had systematic failure of the tuner to tune to a radio station when I started the car.  Sometimes, there would be non-working camera links or other infotainment system errors.  The automatic collision braking system is a joke.  Twice now, the automatic system took over while I was braking, but it forces the car to brake in maybe a 1' span and way before it's really necessary, literally grinding the car to a halt without warning.    The first time it happened, I had at least 8' or more of play in front of me.  And the car behind me hit me because they didn't anticipate the unnecessarily & immediate halting of my car.  I only see this automatic braking system causing more accidents than they were designed to prevent.  Gas mileage is not nearly as advertised, around 20mpg average.

The transmission is smooth so far, handling is great for the type of vehicle this is. It's quiet, it's comfortable, very good headlights etc. Again, the car side of the equation is wonderful. Now, the other side of this. The infotainment system in this car is garbage. It crashes from time to time, the Nav system is antequated. Cannot name addresses, searches come up empty. It runs at 1/4 mile resolution unless on a highway. Then it comes out a hair more. Still no good if you want to see the big picture. The radio will just say ""loading"" on startup sometimes. Requiring the power to by cycled. Sound is very inconsistent from source to source. Strange digital pops when talking over BT.  Everyday it's something new. All of this is while using Apple Car Play or an Android phone paired of BT. With some research, I've found many reporting the same issues. To top it off, dealers are helpless as there's no way for them to fixed this. This isn't new technology. Just new in this car, and regardless of price point it's shameful that it operates so poorly.

acura,rdx,2019,Michael, 08/06/2019,A bunch of lies,neg,"This car isn't what you think it is.  The onboard system is clunky with many issues, the MPG is 20% or worse lower than advertised, Android Auto is still in testing a year later, the gas tank is incredibly small and for the price the mirrors should fold in automatically.  Additionally, AcuraLink has never worked on my vehicle...I've given up on fixing it.

The only positives are the interior options and the SH-AWD, however the vehicle would been better off with a 6 cyl.

acura,rdx,2019,LiyaM, 08/30/2018,Comfort & Performance,pos,"Traded my 2012 RDX Tech (considered the loaded model) for the 2019 RDX Advance. Wanted the ASPEC for the rims but loaded like an Advace, so I got the black Advance with black interior and upgraded to black rims. It's a gorgeous car! It rides like a dream. I drove it out of state the second day I had it and it surpassed my expectations! The comfort was superb and handling on sport or sport+ mode was nice and tight. The seats are soft and supple. Loved the lane keep assist and cruise control features - the car sort of drives itself! The panoramic sunroof is a gorgeous addition. The touch pad gets easier to use with practice, but is a little frustrating at first. A few cons: a small space for coins would be nice as well as a bigger center console (my 2012 was much smaller but the center console was huge). Also, the navigation system needs an upgrade. There are portions of not so new roads where I was 'flying in the gray' on the screen because those roads weren't recognized. Had I not had my phone (Android) GPS on, I'd been lost.

acura,rdx,2019,California, 07/27/2018,Bad surprise,neu,"I owned 2 hondas before, which I loved.  About 1 momth ago bought a new Acura rdx SH-Awd 2019. Very comfortable, luxury looking.  To the bad surprise, over the past week I had two problems with acceleration, like I was stuck in traffic light or stop for some time, accelerating very slowly. Then 2 days ago my car would not accelerate at all, while revving at 5-6 rpm, barely moving on the road. I had to call towing. Now got a courtesy car from dealership, but they have not been able to identify the problem, saying now it works ok. I would not risk that type of failure on the busy freeway, so would not drive that car until problem is found. So Lynn, who wrote a review on 7/15, you are not the only “unlucky” person. It seems flaws are not due to luck at all, but rather due to manufacturer flows. I would not recommend buying these cars until more reports would start to come up, since everything is different in this new model, transmission, engine, etc. I am very disappointed.

acura,rdx,2019,Jay, 11/26/2018,Rough transmission transition when leaving,neg,"Looks like I’m not the only one who sensed rough transmission transition at low speed. I believe 2019 RDX has a serious transmission problem. I have a base model. The problem that I noticed is that when leaving my place in the morning with the temperature gauge stuck at the lowest position, the vehicle jerks when switching the gear to upper ones at low speed. As the temperature gauge bar appears as it’s warmed up, the abrupt transition of transmission becomes smoother. I tried warming up for 5 minutes before leaving and the problem was less severe. So this vehicle requires warming up as most of vehicles in 80s or 90s did. But remember you're buying a so-called luxury vehicle paying more than 40 grand in 2019. This is really hard to reproduce at dealer because by the time I arrive at dealer, the vehicle is already warmed up. People complained a lot about hard control of electronic system, but I don’t, it’s a matter of time to get used to it. Another issue is this 2019 RDX is gas greedy, usually I can get a little less than 23 mile/gallon but it requires 92 octane recommended. When I'm spending more money for high-end version and more gas with higher priced  octane gas, at least I didn't expect rattling or jerking of rough transmission transition.

acura,rdx,2019,Adrienne, 08/04/2019,Horrible,neg,"Alert for anyone.. The technology package in the 2019 RDX is defective
Navigation freezes, dosn’t slways work, & directions are inaccurate/some places don’t exist ... & radio issues as well, such as not turning off even after car is turned off!
ACURA IS AWARE OF THIS! but is continuing to sell this to customers without informing them! THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEMS! & Acura refuses to do right by customers!

* I was stranded in a strange neighborhood very late at night alone,.. navigation stopped working,.. and radio was on and would not go off. I had to get out of vehicle to make a phone call to try and figure out where I was/ and needed to go while walking around trying to find street signs.

Have had navigation worked on many times! THERE IS NO PERMANANT FIX!

acura,rdx,2019,Bart Firp, 09/30/2019,Acura coporate admits they can't fix the problem,neg,"Have 2019. The computer screen stays on when the car is shut off causing the battery to die. Was told disconnect the battery and this should fix the problem. Fixed the problem for a week. The same thing happens again. If you are reading this, I warn you stay far away from the RDX. "
acura,rdx,2019,CM, 12/11/2018,"So far, so good",pos,"My family loves this car and would buy it again; in fact, if we were replacing our second car today, we'd end up with two identical cars in the driveway. We evaluated every competing 2-row luxury SUV and chose this one mainly because it: 1. Offers the best interior space and comfort relative to exterior dimensions (including ample rear headroom and legroom); 2. Has the best mix of sporty luxury; 3. Has the freshest design and technology; 4. Offers the most competitive pricing, even when fully loaded. Noting only things that I haven't read about much in other excellent, comprehensive reviews: window defrost takes forever, even after starting the car remotely; the rear seats allow little adjustment/recline; lane-keeping assist has so little reliability that it adds nothing to vehicle convenience or safety (but adaptive cruise control with low speed follow works great); even with 50/50 suburban/highway driving, our gas mileage won't budge from 18.2.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Tank, 12/09/2018,Curb your expectations..,neu,"Okay, so this car is loaded with features... Keyless entry, Lane keep assist, collision mitigation, adaptive radar cruise control, backup camera, 10 speed dual clutch automatic transmission, auto engine start/stop, remote start (via phone app or optional 2 way remote), active noise cancelling, 16 speaker ELS surround sound, climate control, heated and cooled seats, all in a very affordable package. What is there not to like? Well, beginning with the fact that barely ANY of the aforementioned features actually work like one would expect, there's quite a bit... First, let's discuss it's ""safety features"".  The RDX's collision mitigation system only beeps at you and charges the brakes, however it does NOT actually stop the car regardless of speed or distance setting. The lane keep assist only reliably works on straight roads with perfect lines, so if you're coming up on an off-ramp, pay attention as it wants to take you off the exit. In addition, LKAS is only available at speeds of 45mph or above, so if there's any sort of traffic that brings your speed below 45mph, it just shuts off. The backup camera could also be better - not sure if it's the location of the camera itself but it is very very subject to any rain drops laying on the lens and subsequently blocking it's view (which only rarely happened on my other cars). Next onto the rest of the ""features"" like the remote start. Yes, you can start the car remotely, however your climate control settings are disabled until you get in. To be clear, the RDX definitely WILL heat and cool the cabin, but at an alarmingly slow rate. It uses it's lowest heating or cooling settings (not your preset temps). As expected, the heated/cooled seats are off until you get in the car so there's no reprieve there either on hot/cold days. The AcuraLink app works about 70% of the time for me. During the other 30%, it's asking me to register my car (again and again) or it's not available. I've had no issues with the keyless entry so far, aside from the fact that you cannot roll the windows up from the keyfob like almost every other late model car. You CAN however roll them down with the keyfob, just not remotely roll them back up?? The 10 speed transmission is next up on the quirky list. Since it's paired to a turbo v-tec 4, you will run into the occasion where the car shifts just as the torque band kicks in leading to an uncomfortable jerky ride... In comfort mode, the car really should skip every other gear... The active noise cancellation is also another oddity. It's hard to tell if it's actually working because it's just not that quiet compared to say a Q5, Lexus NX-RX, or even a Ford Edge. Engine note aside, the car does little to shield you from the road noise. The ELS sound system is actually quite good, but the lack of insulation in the car, noticeably hinders it's performance. A little resonance control in the door panels would have gone a long way. The infotainment center is next on my critique list. I'm not going to pass judgement on the ergonomics as I knew the shortcomings prior to purchase, however the lack of detailed control over the vehicle's many functions is almost disturbing to me. Just as with the Acura Link app, most of the functions of the infotainment system are relegated to either ON or OFF with little customization. So why buy this car? My opinion - buy it for it's SH-AWD which is amazing. Buy this car for it's strong engine and ""expected"" Honda reliability. Buy the car for it's roomy interior. Buy this car for it's looks. Whatever the reasoning may be, buying this car for the tech features should be last on the list. In that regard, there are much better offerings on the market today. Yes most of the competition out there would charge more, but I would much rather pay for something that works instead of something that doesn't. This car is the epitome of smoke and mirrors. By
 cramming a seemingly huge amount of features into an affordable package, the new RDX appears to be a steal. In reality, half of the features/options function as what one would expect but most buyers probably won't even notice. At least not until they have owned or test driven one of the competitor's vehicles..

acura,rdx,2019,Danny, 10/12/2018,Anyone Else Having Issues,pos,"Overall I love my SUV, however I noticed a few things that need to get checked. As I have seen in a few of these posts, the turbo lag is noticeable when at low speed, and then quickly accelerating, there is a substantial pause. Also, at low speeds, the gear shift from 1,2, and 3 are really abrupt. Even more abrupt when stopped on a hill, and just letting your foot of the brake to let the car roll. Another possible issue, when at certain speeds, it feels as though the car is (putting along), like the turbo is making the car shake. One last thing to note, when at high speeds (60, 70, 80) and braking, my SUV shakes, almost like the brakes are warpt. At first I thought it may be the transmission downshifting from so many gears, then I thought it was the breaks, and then possibly the turbocharger (putting) when the car is braking hard. Any thoughts? Anyone else experiencing this?
"
acura,rdx,2019,BZone, 02/25/2019,Extremely Nice Car...need to know a few tricks,pos,"After spending a considerable amount of time researching SUV's in this class and test driving them, without a doubt, this is the clear winner for me, for a few different reasons and while not perfect, what is important to me the RDX excelled in those areas.  There are a couple of tricks to know to get full benefit of the vehicle and I have only had it a few days so will continue to update as I learn more.  Comfort: Excellent, seats are extremely comfortable and very adjustable. The detail level control knob is a little ways back, so you might miss it.  It does a great job of showing on on-screen what parts of the chair you are adjusting and being a tall driver, it is nice that it extends out under the legs.  Another great feature is the seat cooling and heating has an auto feature that is awesome, it automatically adjusts the heating and cooling of the seat based on overall temperature.  Cabin is very quiet and audio is better than most of the other vehicles I tried.  THe 4 cylinder is a little noisier accelerating than the previous six cylinder, but is not a distraction.  My one caveat is that the hood does have a noticeable ridgelines and while not normally distracting, you do notice it.  Drivability: While there are not a lot of them around, I strongly recommend getting the AWD, it isn't just for bad weather, it drives nicer and I found out the 2 wheel drive doesn't come with a spare tire either...which is a $600 option.  Was cautious about the 4 cylinder at first, but it has plenty of power, and is fun to drive.  Tech: Very good, but takes a little getting used to the keypad...one thing I really like is that the display is wide so you can see quite a bit side by side.  For example, if you are using Apple Carplay, in our pilot it takes up the entire screen, but this one allows you to have apple car play on the main part of the screen and still see other things (like navigation if you want to use the built in navigation) next to it.  There are also a lot of niceties, for example, when you want to turn off the headlights because you are sitting in front of a store but want the vehicle to keep running, with most cars you have to turn it off and then remember to turn it back on.  With the RDX, you can just turn it off and it flips back to auto immediately and will turn them back on for you when you start moving again.  This is my first HUD and I found it to be very helpful and easier to see than some of the other vehicles I tried and it is very adjustable.  Access to USB, power, etc. is very good, but one improvement would be more of a dedicated place to store your phone...there is a place to put it, but nowadays, it just seems there should be a designated spot for it.  On another review in this thread, someone points out that you can't import your contacts.  You actually can, but there is a trick to it.  Once you connect via blutooth, you have to go to the device on the phone, press info, and then select the option to allow the phone to share contacts with that device.  I don't think that is an Acura specific thing so it shouldn't be held against them.  This model scores excellent on safety scores and am not willing to do a dummy test on my vehicle so will just have to trust the people that do those tests:)  On a last note, when purchasing the vehicle, I built it online first and selected the accessories I wanted, but when I got to the dealer, the prices were wildly different.  When I asked, they stated that those don't include the ""installation"" fees...so if you go to their parts department and show them the online prices they will match it and most things are easily installed by yourself."
acura,rdx,2019,Paul, 02/26/2019,My Blue Apex Pearl RDX: Awesome SUV,pos,"Reading over many unsatisfied customers, I am relieved that my own experience isn't the same.  I know how frustrating it is when your car doesn't function and live up to the value of the car.  I had some run-ins with my own MDX; minor issues that can mount to be real annoyance.  Nevertheless, this RDX has been awesome to drive and the engine's sound it produces is really nice; especially during cold starts, the engine hums with power.  I love it!  Although many others complained about the touch pad, my own experience has been very positive.  It took some time to get use to but the fixed position to control the infotainment is perfect and easy to use.  The ability to swap the split screen was an excellent decision by Acura.  The only annoyance with the navigation system is the fact the speech recognition software isn't very accurate.  When I tell it to navigate to a concern address, it often gets it wrong; I would have to repeat it several times before it gets it close.  Sometimes, the spoken address is completely wrong and doesn't get it right.  Having used the Acura system before, you need to make sure the city location is according to its own database.  Another minor issue with my car, is the rubber seal that surround my panoramic roof.  It doesn't leak but it is slightly off on the right side.  It looks like it is slightly more pressed in; potential problem of dust and dirt getting trapped in that space and eventually ending up in the water drain in the sun roof.  I may take it in to have service look at it.  Other than these very minor issues, nothing else to report.  Right now, it has nothing but joy to drive and enjoy the new car.

acura,rdx,2019,Unsatisfied customer, 09/27/2019,Computer system cannot be fixed,neg,"Do not get this car. I repeat. Do not get this car. The computer system is [non-permissible content removed]. The computer does not shut off when the car is off. The battery goes dead. Roadside assistance charges the battery. The dealer resets the system by unplugging the battery and reconnecting it. The same problem continues days later. There is no current fix. Acura states we do not know what to do,"
acura,rdx,2019,JinJJa, 08/27/2018,Everything is great except for the fuel economy.,pos,"I was one of the first 10,000 purchasers of this awesome SUV and just put in my first 1000 miles. The 2019 Acura RDX has exceeded all my expectations. It handles better than my C class Mercedes. It accelerates very quickly. It is very quiet and comfortable. It can haul LOT of cargo and every one loves the backseat room. It has awesome stereo (which takes 100 hours of play to break in). The SH AWD is just awesome on highways and high speed twisty roads. It also adds a LOT of fun to the ride. Some experts have panned its transmission but, in my opinion, it is better than good. The ONLY downside of this vehicle is that it does only 18.5 MPG combined. I do a fair amount of driving on the highways. That is significantly lower than the 24 MPG as advertised. It also has the highest safety rating possible form IIHS. The reliability remains to be seen. But I am loving this SUV so far.
"
acura,rdx,2019,DZ, 02/05/2019,Really regretting my purchase,neg,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I regret my decision to buy my 2019 RDX (Technology package).  What was “love at first sight” has turned into a “hate at first month” experience and this car is not living up to the Acura name and alleged “quality” at all.  I am so disappointed and frustrated with this vehicle and was not expecting all the issues I’ve had in the first 2 months of ownership.  If I could take it back I would.  Unfortunately for me I do keep my cars for a long time and with an expensive car like this one I’ll be stuck with it for long time.   The car is definitely great looking and stylish, but that’s where my “likes” start and end.  For the first month and a half of ownership I took it in 4 times, was in a loaner car for 1/3 of this time and now I have to take it in AGAIN because of other issues.  I started having issues at 1,500 miles and I now have 2,000 with more issues.  There are so many flaws with this car, but before I go into the actual issues that required and still require trips to the dealership, let me tell you about a few general complaints:
- The FM radio drives me NUTS and that’s because you never get consistent sound.  There is this “HD” signal that goes in and out when you drive and when that happens not all of the speakers work so the sound goes from loud to low and vice versa and it comes through different speakers as well.  It is SO ANNOYING that I can’t listen to my favorite radio stations at all.  You do have the option to turn off “HD” and only play analog, but when you do that you don’t get sound from the 12 speakers that they brag about so much.  So what’s the point of that many speakers if you can’t get them to play the sound???  Sorry Acura, but my 12 year Toyota Yaris had better radio sound than this.
- The lane departure feature entails an orange light that pops up on the dash.  How exactly is a “light” supposed to effectively get the driver’s attention if they “depart the lane” due to a distraction?  Have they not considered adding an option for a sound?  Yes, you shouldn’t expect a car to replace driver’s common sense, but a light certainly doesn’t “assist” with anything.
- The car did not come with all weather mats and the Acura ones suck.  I had to buy Weathertechs, I also had to buy a rubber mat for the trunk, etc.  How do you pay mid 40’s for a car and don’t get basic mats?  My best friend purchased an Outback a month before I purchased my car and for a car that was two thirds of the price of mine, she got EVERYTHING included – rubber mats, retractable trunk cover, etc.  I’d rather pay more and get it all instead of feeling nickled and dimed.
- Remote start did not come manufacturer installed and you have to order it separately OR you can pay an arm and a leg for a useless app.  Why?  Again, if the car was in the $20-$30 K range that’s fine, but these cars are not cheap.
- Infotainment system is HORRENDOUS – trying to write with your finger or type is a nightmare.  I hate everything about the infotainment system and I will leave it at that.
- You can’t lift your wipers.
- I don’t care as much about the mileage because I bought the car for the performance and style, but I wanted to point out that the “mileage” that was published for this car was pulled out of thin air … 19 mpg has been my max.
So here is a list of the things that I have taken my car in for and will be taking it in again this week:
1) Infotainment system not working – I would get the blue disclaimer screen that would stay on at all times even when I stopped and locked the car.  My husband had to pull a fuse so my battery doesn’t die overnight.  I have also had the infotainment screen go completely blank for days.   I’ve taken my car in twice for this issue and they still don’t have a permanent fix.  The Service Manager even joked and told me that if it happens again at least I know which fuse to pull.  Excuse me,
 I did not pay an arm and a leg for a car to pull a fuse at 1,500 miles, this is not what I signed up for.
2) Auto stop/start – after I picked up my car from the dealer when I took it in for the screen issues, I now have and hear this loud awful clunky sound when the car re-starts.  In addition, the auto stop/start engages whenever it feels like it.  I took the car back to the dealer, but they couldn’t reproduce the sound at that time so I’m stuck driving a car that makes this loud noise when the auto stop disengages.
3) Break sound – my car now makes this awful break noise when I release the breaks after coming to a full stop.  Once again I have no ideas why and how this is happening so I have to take the car in again.
Story of my life … I somehow have this awful feeling that this will be the story of my Acura car ownership.  For Acura’s sake I hope the rest of the owners have better experience than mine.

acura,rdx,2019,Tammy, 04/16/2019,One month in wish I could get my money back,neu,"I purchased the Acura RDX AWD Advanced Package after looking for a new vehicle for several months. I was driving a 2012 BMW X3 that I customer ordered and purchasing in the fall of 2011. I was cautious going from a V6 to an inline 4 turbo. That concern was not merited. I have no issues with power or performance of my new Acura. I actually really like the HUD and the blind spot monitors. The car is luxurious and drives great. So what's my problem? The infotainment. For 50k I should be able to play music without an issue. Initially thinking the problem was me and it was just a learning curve, my 22 and 19 yr old children said ""mom its not you"". The car has been at the dealer twice now for service, only 819 miles on the car. The screen goes blank, at times it freezes and wont play anything at all. Yesterday I selected my country playlist and the system played my disco playlist. If I get a text message or phone call while driving forget it, the entire system goes astray. They removed the CD player in this model so playing a CD is not an option I have to rely on a USB or my phone for my music. Dealer says nothing is wrong. When researching for a new vehicle I knew there were early issues with the infotainment but thought they had been resolved. Sounds silly but it is not. This is a lot of money for a new car and I drive my vehicles for a long time.

acura,rdx,2019,Irvguy50, 03/04/2019,Very nice SUV.,pos,"So I've only had my 2019 Rdx Aspec a week now. Not in l love with the road departure mitigation system. Dont like my steering wheel shaking.  Also, the automatic stop/start engine. Not a fan! My thinking is what if the engine doesnt start at an intersection. Then I'm left stranded. Also, this has to cause wear and tear on the starter. So, last but not least I had the lane keeping assist off and I felt like there was play in the steering. I had a hard time holding it in the road on the highway doing 70. Not sure what this was all about. May have to reach out to the dealership on this one if it keeps up. Also, the sports+ mode seems.like it revs up the engine to 3k rpm. Feels like it's not shifting when it should. Kind if stresses me out for  something I've paid 45k for. Positves: the body style is spot on. I have the white & black. It really reminds me off a Evoque. The interior- love it. The look is awesome and the dual moon roof.. love it!! I hope these issues subside within a few weeks. Thought Acura would have done their home work better before releasing this vehicle. We also have a 2018 Rdx tech pkg and I love that vehicle..
"
acura,rdx,2019,Nick Z, 06/23/2018,Great luxury compact SUV! NOT!!!,neg,"The title says it all!  I've had my RDX for a couple weeks and love everything about it, except it lacks some of the things the Canadian Elite Platinum model has:  power folding mirrors, puddle lights, temp control for the rear seats, headlight washers, and articulating headlights.  I would have gladly paid more for those features for my RDX, but sadly no such option for this model year that I know of.  Fit and finish is top notch, and I got 27.2 on the Interstate right out of the box.  The 3D audio system is excellent, but only ""discrete"" surround; not true 5.1 or 7.1 surround I had in my loaded '16 Lexus RX 350 I traded in.  Big disappointments are the lack of a CD player, and wireless phone charger.  The RDX's is really peppy even using regular 87 octane gas.  It looks like the RDX is a keeper for at least a couple of years.

Update:  On 1 January 2019 the RDX went into “limp mode”.  Long, long story, Honda/Acura refused to acknowledge there was a serious problem even with numerous complaints to NHSTA.  Consequently, I sold the RDX at the end of April 2019 for a BIG loss.  Of course, the RDX is now under recall for a bad fuel pump.  As a consequence I will never buy or recommend a Honda or Acura product ever again.

"
acura,rdx,2019,Slack, 09/02/2018,Disappointed in my 2019 RDX,neu,"I traded in my 2009 Acura TL 3.5L V6 Tech Pkg sedan for the 2019 RDX Advance.  I loved almost everything about my TL including its acceleration, sound system, and ride.  However, I wanted a vehicle that I could enter & exit without bending so low.  All the reviewers on YouTube & in print seemed to have high praise for the new RDX, so I made the change after a couple test drives.  I've had the vehicle only a couple of weeks and I'm already regretting my purchase.  It is fun to drive, but I've had several issues.  On my second day, Apple CarPlay wouldn't work.  Then after pairing my iPhone X to the Bluetooth, my contacts were not available.  So I hard reset my phone, reset the infotainment system to factory default and that seemed to fix the problem for the moment.  After about 450 miles of mixed driving, I'm averaging about 17.5 mpg.  You read it right - 17.5 mpg, and mostly in Comfort mode with no redlining.  I'm going to conduct a highway only test soon, but I don't expect to get the advertised mpg.  Yesterday, my monitor stopped working, as did the auto idle feature ( even though I don't particularly care for it, it should work!)  Aside from features not working, I am disappointed in the turbo lag.  It has almost caused an accident because I couldn't get out of the way of an oncoming car while turning at a traffic light.  That's beyond inconvenient.  Anyway, I will probably trade it next year for a more proven vehicle.  Fortunately, this is the first time I have had this much trouble with a new vehicle, so I'm lucky, but I cannot recommend this with all its initial problems.

UPDATE:  After 4000+ more miles and seven months, I’m still regretting my choice.  I took the car to the dealership because when the auto engine idle stop restarted the engine, it would release the electric brake hold, causing my car to move forward while at traffic stops.  Fortunately I was able to manually brake before rear ending the car in front of me.  Also, the auto engine idle stop engaged so often that it drained my battery within six months! Prior to purchasing the vehicle, I was assured that this feature would not affect battery life.  So, the technician decided to kill two birds with one stone.  He retuned/reset auto engine idle stop so that now it doesn’t engage at all!  So that should save the new battery and eliminate the release of electronic brake hold since there is no engine restart now.  While I don’t necessarily miss the idle feature, that’s how Acura achieved its EPA mileage ratings, which were already overstated.  Now, I’ll get even less mileage per gallon.  And, as many owners have commented, Apple CarPlay still only works intermittently.  It’s mostly useless because it drops in the middle of apps.  In fairness, I did get up to 27 MPG on a recent road trip, so I guess the highway gear ratios work well if in steady traffic.  But as soon as I returned to mixed driving, the MPG returned significantly less than advertised.  I’m pretty sure this will be my last Acura and that’s unfortunate because I really liked my 2009 TL.  Had this new architecture worked well, and assuming it would be migrated to the MDX in 2020, I had thought about upgrading in a year or two.  That plan is moot now.

ONE YEAR LATER:  I’ve owned the 2019 RDX for a year now and most of my original review still holds.  The infotainment system is still problematic with Apple CarPlay only staying connected intermittently, and glitches in the nav system have the head up display (HUD) showing upcoming turns opposite those on the nav screen.  The nav voice prompt often agrees with the HUD’s incorrect direction.  Even with most recent firmware update, many problems still exist.  The turbo lag/transmission lag on quick passing acceleration situations is still annoying.  I often have to quickly downshift to prevent getting broadsided by an oncoming vehicle.

I still love the
 ride and handling of the RDX.  I call it my big sports car when in sport+ driving mode.  The driver’s seat and leg room are very comfortable for a midsize SUV.  The sound system is the best I’ve ever had in a car, and aside from the HUD losing its mind occasionally, I love that feature.  As to whether I’ll buy another Acura, probably not.  Acura does not seem interested in addressing these complaints by 2019 RDX owners.  Whatever I purchase next will have a more reliable infotainment system in which Apple CarPlay works.

acura,rdx,2019,Kay, 01/30/2019,Can we have our 2016 RDX back?,neg,"A real city driving (25 miles daily commute with 50% highway) showing a pathetic 18mpg!   It is the same as my hubby's GX460 which is a V8!  Engine is noisy even a mild pushing of gas pedal.   My old 2016 RDX could easily do 22mpg even 28 mpg on highway!   Why Acura all of a sudden going backward is beyond me, but if anyone out there has a low mileage 2018 V6 RDX I will trade mine with you!!!!

acura,rdx,2019,Scarlette, 03/27/2019,Loved it and now I regret It,neg,"I have had my new RDX for 4 months. I have 5k miles on it. Gear shifting is spotty. Brakes scream. Suspension crunches and squeaks when you go over bumps. I’m driving a brand new car the rides and sounds like a 15y/o car. Dealership tells me Acura is aware of all these issues but head quarters won’t let them fix it till there is an official recall. They are not sure what is causing it yet. My screen freezes and fails all the time. To protect myself I started videoing all the noises and issues. Now they are taking me more seriously! This is my 3rd time at service and it’s really hard not to tell the couple in the show room to run! I loved this car and I’m truly disappointed by it. When everything is working it’s amazing, but that’s a rare occurrence. Sorry for typos I’m on my phone and I am truly aggravated that I am sitting her at the dealership yet again.

acura,rdx,2019,Frank Callahan, 08/07/2018,Get What You Pay For,pos,"This is my first Japanese car. My family has historically owned German vehicles, which we had been very happy with. I had seriously considered buying another German car, but for comparison, thought I would look at Lexus and Acura. Did not like the Lexus RX 350 but was impressed with the Acura RDX during respective test drives. Comparing it to the Audi Q5, the RDX was $15K less expensive and that was the motivating factor for me. However, having driven the RDX now for two weeks I can say that it is not a smooth and comfortable a ride as the Audi (which y wife currently drives). Also, during my purchasing analysis, I liked the idea of the 10-gears in the RDX transmission. However, I find the car is constantly shifting and looking for the ""right"" gear. This is particularly apparent when I am in traffic. The seats are very comfortable and the interior luxurious. Does the $15K savings offset the car's shortfalls? I'm not sure and probably need more time with the vehicle to answer confidently.

acura,rdx,2019,G. Madia, 08/12/2018,First week with RDX Advance package.,pos,"I researched a lot of vehicles and the level of items included in my Advance trim RDX is unmatched for the given price level (< $46k). The ride is solid, the interior is quiet and built with quality materials. The multi adjusting drivers seat is outstanding, the HUD is great and the sound system in the Advance package is unreal. My only complaint thus far is the finger pad that controls the center console can be a bit confusing and trying to input an address in the Nav system was problematic. I instead used voice control and the system nailed the address on the first try. Finally, the LKAS only notifies you of lane drift via vibration and visual cues I wish it also adjusted the steering wheel to keep you in the lane like my wife's new Volvo does..but then again the sticker price on the Volvo was $15k higher.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Pauli E, 06/24/2019,Not Ready for Prime Time,neg,"If you are thinking of buying a 2019 RDX, do yourself a favor. Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the operation of the Infotainment system on YouTube or some other resource so that you can put it through its paces when you take a test drive.

The infotainment system is bad, really bad. First, it is EXTREMELY SLOW. I can’t believe that during the design phase, a manager looked at the responsiveness and said “Good work - Yes, this is fine”!  Many operations take 15 – 30 seconds, and if the “circle of confusion” (the Processing indicator” on the display screen) is spinning for more than approximately 30 seconds, there is a good chance that the operation you thought was simply taking a LONG time will abort with a “System Unavailable” message or some other such nonsense.  How can the system be unavailable? I was just trying to change the radio station!  

All sorts of miscellaneous bugs – intermittent at that!   The system also frequently gets into a locked up situation where the “circle of confusion” spins for several minutes, blocking you out from using the system during that time. MANY MANY BUGS. The most recent on my vehicle – the one that pushed me over the edge to write this review -  Sirius XM was on station “X”. I commanded the system, via voice to switch to “Sirius Channel “Y”.  After the excruciatingly long delay that is common when issuing voice commands, the system reports that it had switched to station “Y”. Guess what?  Radio was still on station “X”!!   And to make things worse, the up-down hard channel buttons on the dash did nothing either. Of course, I hit them several times trying to get them to work. I finally gave up.  About four minutes later, the radio starts jumping up and down the channel list, apparently in response to the up down button presses I had issued SEVERAL MINUTES EARLIER (and did I mention that the reason I was using the hard channel buttons was because the voice command didn’t work!!)   As far as other bugs, they are too numerous to document here, many of them bizarre like the one described above. Do your own research.

I am writing this review on 6-24-19, and I have the latest software version (d1.1.2). The car has been out for a year.  Based on that, I am not hopeful of rapid resolutions to these software bugs, and I don’t know how they will ever address the slow response issue. The last RDX software update was issued Feb 13, 2019. Take a look at the HUGE list of bugs in the link below supposedly fixed in that release.   And no updates since then?????
https://owners.acura.com/Documentum/ota/2019_RDX.pdf


There now appears to be a Class Action suit on 2019 RDX Infotainment System - 
Google     “2019 Acura RDX class action suit”  for details.
Looks like some customer are done waiting for Acura to fix these bugs.

This is Consumer Report’s take on the RDX’s Infotainment System:  “One of the worst we have encountered recently”. And they were just talking about the “user friendliness” aspect of the system, not the slowness and buggy nature that would have eventually cropped up.

How prevalent are these problems? A search online shows, that in desperation, RDX owners have resorted to temporarily disconnecting the battery, pulling fuses, and the “Three finger reset”:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7uLCjHK-cU


Regarding Acura’s new  ”True Touch” design, the idea is supposed to be that your eyes are higher up, and therefore, it is a safer system. But the overly complex and confusing user interface, combined with the fact that you are touching one location and viewing another, and lastly navigating through the bug prone and slow performance of the system, totally erases any advantage the higher view screen allegedly provides.  This system is INFINITELY more distracting than my other car, which has a simple touch screen with a simple interface  and VERY QUICK response.
And if you use Apple Play,
 the True Touch paradigm is no longer is even applicable!!!!  – you are now dragging the cursor! A simple and reliable touch screen would have been WAY WAY better in my opinion.

The car itself rides nice, but the aggravation with the slow response and a new bug popping up every couple of days totally takes the fun out of owning a new (luxury) car. Every time the “Circle of Confusion” rears its ugly head on this new 50K luxury car, it’s more salt in the wound.

Other Issues:
Gas mileage is poor, the front parking sensors do not work, and the keyless entry sometimes does not work!  The rear camera is useless when wet. The brakes are “grabby” when wet or damp. The Adaptive Cruise Control is too aggressive with the brakes, more so that if you were using a standard cruise control, so I just use Cruise Control with the Adaptive Feature turned off.

All new models have SOME growing pain, but the Infotainment system definitely would be a deal breaker if I had to do it again.

acura,rdx,2019,RK, 10/17/2018,Great SUV,pos,"First the positive...Love the ride/handling/power of this vehicle.Drives like a sports sedan.Love driving it.Turbo hesitation not very evident to me.The cargo space in the car is just right,seats very comfortable..especially on trips.                         Consumer Reports mentioned the shifter ,and especially the touchpad as not cool ,but I think they are items that differentiate the car.Don't mind the touchpad at all now..after spending some time playing around with it, I like the system.               
     Now to the one not -so - positive.....The engine turn off at idle drives me crazy...I hope they come up with an override for this because you have to press a button every time starting the car to turn it  off.      .....All in all ,it's still a really fine SUV and I would absolutely buy it again.The price is great compared to other premium SUVs with the same equipment.

acura,rdx,2019,Damion G, 02/07/2019,Biggest vehicle purchase regret ever,neu,"I read all the car magazine reviews that the new RDX was an amazing new vehicle and a great value.  Boy, are they wrong!  This has been the biggest mistake I've made with a vehicle purchase.  As soon as I got it home I washed the RDX by hand and realized there are numerous paint defects.  Too many to list.  Also the whole car has way too much orange peel in the paint.  My local body shop looked at it and said there was something wrong when they sprayed it and he was surprised they let it out of the factory that way. 2nd issue, the audio system doesn't work. This is noted in almost every review.  I didn't know that going in, or I wouldn't have bought it. 3rd, after a month and 1300 miles, the car breaks down. It had a Cylinder 1 misfire.  They said one of the on board computers had a virus and crashed causing the engine to run rough.  4th, the mileage is horrible!  My 2016 Tahoe could get this or better gas mileage.  I am so pissed at Acura right now.  The dealership I bought it from has been terrible.  They are avoiding me now.  They won't return calls or anything.  I want to get rid of this thing so bad, I don't know what to do.  Other dealerships have told me they don't want it.  Trade offers are very low.  Don't waste your money on the new RDX.

acura,rdx,2019,LightSPD, 08/01/2018,"Great drive, nav system unusable",neg,"2019 RDX is sporty to drive...very responsive, quiet, handles well.  The major flaw is the navigation system.  It defaults to a screen scale of 1 inch = 3/4 of a mile and the scale can't be changed.  Also, you can't name favorites for the frequent places you visit.  I have spoken to Acura tech support and these are known deficiencies in the system.  They were unable to commit to a software upgrade to get it fixed in the future.  I use  the apple carplay feature now for nav, but then you lose all the integration niceties with the other systems......makes a great car a bummer.

acura,rdx,2019,Eastern PA Driver, 08/26/2018,Best Bang for the Buck,pos,"The newly designed RDX is almost perfect.  Starting from the looks and exterior to the interior fit and finish the vehicle is top notch. I chose the base model because it had everything I needed. I did not want to spend a whole lot for the bells and whistles (though I would have if I didn't have two kids in college). The engine is very responsive with excellent power. The electronics is superb. My IPhone works seemlessly with the cars bluetooth. The voice recognition is very good in spite of my accent. As others have mentioned the touch pad does need getting used to.  Once you get the hang of it,  it seems the most logical thing to do as far as safety.  The seats are extremely comfortable with lumbar support (front). My only suggestion is that the base model should have included the blind spot monitoring - now only higher models come with it.  I love the vehicle. It is not cheap but I think it is the best value in a luxury compact SUV.

acura,rdx,2019,Suz, 02/02/2019,Save your money until 2020,neu,"I purchased one of the first RDXs in June 2018. While the interior and exterior look nice, there are countless electronic issues. I have spent hours working with the dealer and Acura corporate. It was a lesson learned the hard way to not purchase a newly released vehicle. The steering wheel controls don't always work, the monitor had outages and it does not work in the cold weather. They claim these issues may be fixed with system update 2 but after waiting months for the first update (and it didn't fix all the issues), I'm not holding my breath. Wait until next year, this one is not worth it.

Update Feb 2020 - ongoing issues with the vehicle. I would not recommend it if electronics are important to you. Had a total outage of infotainment system and system controls, makes for a scary experience.

acura,rdx,2019,Darcee , 08/03/2019,Continues to be Nothing but trouble,neg,"Acura was well aware of the many kinks in this vehicle prior to releasing it. Shame on them. It's a beautiful car,  but I've had nothing but trouble with the infotainment system and system errors. I would basically live at the acura service center if I took it in every time I got an error.  Brakes  intermittently squeak. Another problem they are aware of. I've never been able to achieve the advertised gas mileage. The ventilated seats..well to get any cooling worthwhile you need air conditioning fan on high, which is so loud it sounds like you are in a wind machine. I've had this vehicle in for service more times in under a year, first time was about 3 weeks after purchase,  than I did in all of 12 years owning various Infiniti vehicles.

acura,rdx,2019,Jennifer, 03/15/2019,I want to give this car back,neu,"I was so excited to get this new 2019 RDX it’s fully loaded and handles great and is a beautiful car. But now so disappointed in Acura for putting a vehicle on the market before they got the bugs out. So many electrical issues and they don’t know how to fix them. Let’s start by saying it’s garage kept and I take very good care of my autos. Within 2 months this car has had to be jumped twice but no one knows why as we’ve found nothing left on. I have no small kids that could have left something on, they really don’t know what it could be. The brakes squeak terribly and they are currently working to find a solution, gas mileage is terrible and no where close to what they advertise. I’m getting avg of 19.3 overall and 21.2 if I do highway only driving. It has a small gas tank so I find myself constantly filling up. They have lied and totally misrepresented gas mileage. Next problem is toggle button doesn’t work 85% of the time. Now obviously this isn’t a safety issue however I expect everything I paid for on this car to work. I constantly get a message saying function unavailable. At times on/off button won’t work, app button won’t work and volume control. I just picked my car up yesterday for dealer to tell me there was an update out there that fixed my issue. Before leaving the parking lot guess what the button doesn’t work. They have no clue what to tell me as Acura has no solutions. The dealership is great but their hands are tied because no one knows how to fix these issues. I’ve paid $47,000 for a vehicle full of disappointments. I’d like to sell it but I can’t do that with items not working. Warning don’t buy this vehicle until they get their issues fixed or you will be frustrated as well.

acura,rdx,2019,Jsladin, 10/04/2018,Serious problem after 30 miles,neg,"I have always had Acura’s or Honda’s.  I loved the new RDX for the first four days. Then the entire electrical system failed and the steering wheel completely locked up. Fortunately I had already exited the highway and was in a parking lot. When I called the dealers service that’s when everything  went downhill. Now I will never trust an Acura nor will I trust their service.  Highly disappointed.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Jedd, 03/23/2019,My first and last Acura,neg,"I bought my 2019 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech in October 2018. I was excited at first but the excitement was soon replaced with frustration over harsh transmission shifting between 1st and 2nd, and then again from 2nd to 3rd gears. I then found that the brakes would squeal and resonate so badly that the entire cabin would vibrate. Then it was the Infotainment system. It regularly locks up when trying to change stations regardless of the fact that Acura has sent over the air updates to try to address the issue. Having worked in technology for over 30 years, I can tell you that in my opinion, Acura skimped on the processor and ram that is badly needed to make this system work the way it should. The icing on the cake for me was when I went to check the oil and found that gas had made its way into the oil to the point where the level was over the plastic measuring indicator on the stick. After some research online, I found that all of these issues are known issues. Acura has acknowledged them to me (with the exception of the oil fuel mixing) during service visits and claim that ""they are working on a fix"" which was documented in my receipts.  The oil/fuel mix issue is now beginning to be heavily discussed in Acura forums.  I traded mine in this past week.  My experience with Acura has taught me to not consider them again when it's time for something new.
"
acura,rdx,2019,RT, 03/28/2019,Traded after 6700 miles,neu,"RDX has a lot of potentially great technology, unfortunately far too much of it is poorly implemented.  The things I found lacking that, in aggregate, caused me to move on to something different.  

- Windshield and rear hatch glass both had crazing between the glass layers that was visible when light hit at a certain angle.  

- Infotainment system in general was second class with basic functions either poorly implemented or missing entirely, as well as being slow to respond to input.  

- Noisy interior except for highway driving.  

- Adaptive cruise control was slow to react to a vehicle in front.  Rather than gradually slowing it would wait until the last second then brake the vehicle.  When traffic resumed speed the RDX would do a near full throttle acceleration back to the set speed.  

- Oil being diluted with gasoline (MAJOR PROBLEM).  

- Transmission slow to shift into and out of reverse.  

-  Transmission shifting was erratically rough.  Some days it was good, other days not so much so.  

-  10 Speed transmission made for a very 'busy' experience when driving in stop and go traffic.  By the time the speed got up to 35MPH it was in 7th gear and you feel every shift. 

- Brake squealing/grinding, it's inconsistent and seems to be temperature/humidity related.

acura,rdx,2019,BT, 02/15/2019,2019 RDX A-Spec. Poor infotainment performance,neg,"Technology systems experience random failures, at various times sometimes when driving. Functionality can sometimes be restored by stopping the car and restarting the engine. Sometimes the vehicle must sit for hours with engine off to restore functionality. System failures include dashboard lighting, vehicle display screen, and heads-up display. Numerious dealer visits have provided no solution till today when I was informed that that this is a software issue and that a software vehicle update is required. However this is not available, has not been available for around since November 2018 when I bought my car and no timeline has been offered for this update. I regard this as a safety and driver distraction issue that can lead to collisions. Acura needs to place a higher priority on this issue in order to provide owners with a safer driving environment.

acura,rdx,2019,wayne wallace, 10/07/2018,I would not buy again,neu,"I owned a 2014 RDX and after 120,000 of virtually trouble free miles I was excited to purchase a 2019 with all its technology and performance hype.  I have already a turbo air cooler come off causing me to be all but stranded on the side of the road. Despite the performance hype the turbo 4 in no way out performs the silky smooth previous v-6 and gas millage is horrible.  My v6 would easily run on mid-grade gasoline and deliver 24 mpg on weekly commute. The 2019 runs on Premium fuel and barley get 21mpg. The lack of power is sometimes scary when pulling out in traffic. Don't be fooled by a transmission that has 10 speeds and constantly lets the engine freely rev, look at the speedometer and you will realize you haven't actually sped up to the speed you think you have. I anticipate an investigation into HP and TQ claims as they must have been falsified. I do like the technology and ride of the vehicle and it handles more like a sports car than a SUV but the lack of power and constant transmission shifts are pure annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Pierce Newton, 07/24/2018,Best ever,pos,"My wife calls me a serial car buyer because I have bought so many new cars. The black ASpec is the best yet. I did a lot of research and the thing I was concerned about was the touch pad interface. I'm 70 years old and not very computer savvy. My concerns were not justified. The system is easy to use even for me. I love the majestic black pearl paint with red interior. I usually drive in the Sport mode but Sport+ is awsome. We just made a 1500 mile trip to south Texas and the car (and auto cooling seats!) Performed perfectly. Gas milage was about 28 round trip and the seats very comfortable. I wish the HUD had been available in the A-Spec but I just had to have those red seats! A sports car masquerading as an SUV!

I consider this to be a defect as the radio is not operating what most users would consider to be normal.   I first talked to the dealer. The dealer confirmed that this was a wide spread problem. The dealer said is was a know problem and that Acura had not issued a fix or any infomration on if or when a fix was coming.

acura,rdx,2019,John , 05/22/2019,Disappointed,neu,"I traded in my leased 2016 RDX (which I absolutely loved) for the 2019 after seeing all the cool new features, especially the new Info system.  I hate to say it but I have had nothing but problems since driving it off the lot back in March.  The whole screen freezes on a regular basis...this has happened 3 times now...while I am driving.  It's very distracting as its totally unexpected.  I usually try to play with it trying to get it to work again...NOT SAFE...as I am not watching the road,  The last time I took it to the dealer they showed me how to reset it by pulling the fuse out and plugging it back in.  It's crazy that this is the solution for a $40,000 car.  I tried contacting Acura and they said all I can do is keep bringing it in to the dealer until there is a recall...which isn't guaranteed.  Really?  The transmission sticks, it's not as smooth as my 2016 (I miss my V6), and the controls on my steering wheel sometimes work and sometimes doesn't.  Unless Acura starts helping us with these issues, I don't see myself getting another one once this lease is up.  I have been a Honda/Acura customer since 1999...and have nothing but great experiences until now.  Truly disappointed. :("
acura,rdx,2019,PhillipK, 07/06/2019,90% buyers remorse,neu,"Honestly, this vehicle runs very well, good power, good handling and good looks. I have had 3 Lexus vehicles in the past with almost total satisfaction. My one and only reason to move over to Acura is the SH-AWD which Lexus shamefully does not offer. The Acura technology is shameful, the designer should be fired. In my opinion he is as dumb as they get. I have used a GPS from the beginning of time and have never come across one that a destination could not be named. Who in there right mind could come up with something so stupid? Does Acura expect us to remember an address without a name? Words cannot explain the dumbness of that idiot designer. The unit has to be told at least 3 before it understands your destination and in most cases it fails so you have to input the address manually. The dumb unit also lacks memory, only 30 destinations can be stored. (Lexus 100 named locations)I think that the designer or designers for the infotainment system needs a job at McDonald's, he definitely lacks common sense. I would hope that in the near future that Acura looks elsewhere to redesign the software for the RDX. Did anyone do any R&D before releasing such inadequacy?  In today's market most prestigious vehicles have puddle lights or rather approach lighting. where is yours Acura?  Cabin lighting is also inadequate. Overhead cameras are becoming the norm, where is yours Acura? Why should the Canadian market get Folding outside mirrors and the USA, your largest consumer not have it. I have a 3 car garage and it take some skill to get this car in without hitting the mirrors. Mirrors cannot be even purchased as an option, I would pay whatever a reasonable cost would be for folding mirrors. What about cornering lights, was that given any thought? Even the low end Japanese cars offer reclining rear seats, Maybe I am in error, I should say well thought out vehicles like Hyundai Santa Fe offer all the bells and whistles. Hyundai gets a 4.8 customer rating comparison with RDX 3.5, Isn't that shameful. Acura is supposedly a high end Honda.
The rest of the tech package like lane departure, accident mitigation, lane keep and so on are not aggressive as other vehicles that I have driven, which in my opinion is in adequate. Therefore I would conclude by saying that Acura is missing the boat on good technology, maybe they should take a closer look at Subaru  (Excellent technology, Eyesight seems to work so much better and less prone to accident catastrophe)
Again, I will admit that the Acura drives very well and has not exhibited any transmission, shut downs or Christmas tree dash boards as others have experienced. I was willing to  rent a car for 3 months until the Subaru Outback with the 2.4 Turbo arrived. My vehicle is moving to the islands next year so a good AWD is important to me. I really hope that Acura is going to update the software on this vehicle. I will update my review as I pack on the miles, I did try to return the vehicle after one day of ownership, but Acura South Florida would not accept.

acura,rdx,2019,Charlee Smith, 09/13/2018,A Perfect RX Repacement,pos,"For one month we have been owners of a RDX Advance (Performance Red/Parchment) and really couldn't be happier with our first Acura.  For three years we have been looking for a replacement for my wife's 2006 Lexus RX 330.  The options were narrowed down to the XC-60, QX50, RX and the RDX.  The XC-60 was eliminated on price and the fact that not only is Volvo Chinese owned, but the vehicles currently in the US are made in China.  The QX50 was eliminated on price and a dated interior with a very cheap sliding cover for the center storage area.  We drove the RX and the RDX within the same hour.  The RX didn't demonstrate one advantage over the RDX, and was over $8K more.  The front end styling of the RX also didn't help it.
We have yet to feel any situation in the RDX where we wished for more power.  The new True Touchpad is unique, but it takes less than 15 minutes to adapt to it and is superior.  I was able to program the primary home screen so that 98% of the functions my wife will use are available with one touch.  The voice control for the navigation has been flawless so far.  With part of the money we saved, our dealer added the 20"" diamond-cut wheels to top off its good looks.
My wife is hard to please, and one minor detail can kill a deal.  She loves every feature of the RDX so far.  Any complaint has been remedied with the options available for most functions.  Its floating center console design provides more side leg room and storage than any of its competitors.  With its top safety rating added to the fact that the RDX was designed in California and Ohio and is assembled in Ohio with 60% North American parts, we have no regrets.
After over a year now, over the air updates have corrected minor flaws in the infotainment system and our RDX has never needed a trip back to an Acura dealer.  It still looks good as new and has provided all the cargo capacity we have ever needed.  We are very happy with our first Acura!  We probably would have been just as happy with a new RX, but that would have cost us an additional $8K.
Update March 2020:  With the over the air updates, the infotainment system is much faster and has been working perfectly. The vehicle continues to operate without any glitches and has never required a trip back to our dealer.

acura,rdx,2019,Mr. Rendon, 06/26/2018,"Some yay, some nay....",pos,"Traded in a 2016 AWD Tech and overall happy with the upgrade and i expect it to be just as reliable but in the long run the proven V6 and 6speed seem bulletproof.  I also cant explain why the outgoing model was quicker and more efficent.  The 19’s brakes have been noisy since day 1 with the dealer not able to reproduce the noise(go figure). I also dont like the infotainment unless using apple car play. Acceleration and handling are superb but in Puerto Rico the streets are pretty bad and the sportiness quickly turns rough. Another plus are the headlights but they are to bright for oncoming traffic.

acura,rdx,2019,RedAcura, 02/09/2019,Transmission smoking/broken after 4k miles,neu,"My husband and I bought this car to replace my 2008 Lexus RX350 which was starting to need too many things replaced after 200,000 miles of loyal service. We are busy people so wanted a reliable, comfortable, spiffy SUV with good acceleration and handling for passing and twisty northern CA roads, plus freeway stretches,  Apple Car Play integration to easily  and reliably listen to audiobooks or radio, safely receive and make calls, plus extra tech of assisted cruise control, blind spot alerts, and lane drift protections. A new Lexus had everything except Car Play integration and was a bit slower on acceleration, so we passed on that and hoped a new Acura would  be as reliable as 1998 sedan we had for 10 years. We landed up paying top $ at a SF Bay area dealer after a lot of headaches  to get the color and features we wanted (red, Tech and Advance package, AWD) after some unpleasant dealings and misrepresentations by unsavory sales managers. It took a while for me to get used to the unnecessarily busy and overly complicated, small print controls, the next to useless Acura Navigation (avoiding it) , and the Car Play pseudo-integration. I thought I was getting the hang of everything and had workarounds, until Car Play navigation started periodically freezing up and became frequently slow to launch or didn't launch at all (giving an ""unavailable"" notice) or crashing after a loud sound at  unpredictable and awkward times. Sometimes it would start up again the next day, sometimes simultaneously disabled the Acura nav and radio at the same time, annoying on long stretches of highway. One morning I noticed  a fine, semi-circular crack in the upper windshield near the cameras  (was not off-roading and there was no pebble mark) .  The last straw was when we smelled and saw smoke coming out from the car under the passenger side hood and right wheel area. We took it to the dealer and after initial attempts to brush off issues as ""never heard of this before"" and trying to set up scenarios that would blame the customer, we insisted they look at the transmission as we were worried there was a leak.  Sure enough, the transmission is leaking and now it will be in the shop for a week while they order a new one and replace it on this two month old car.  I am glad I did not get stranded on a remote road we often travel on with no cell phone access. The dealer insisted the windshield crack is not a design defect but was caused by something unrelated, so we are stuck with fixing that on our own dime. Acura service claims the intermittent  CarPlay problems are due to it having two USB ports and only 1 should be used for CarPlay (makes no sense, as we always use the one the dealer told us to use, in the console, and CarPlay usually works off it).But it is a ""non-issue"" in their mind despite many people on forums complaining about its unreliability.    What was supposed to be a reliable new car with safety upgrades has turned into a potentially  unsafe, smoking (but pretty and fun) car which could have started a fire, and  with both Acura Nav and CarPlay so unreliable I would have to unplug  my phone and navigate off of it directly by looking at the screen to do what I want, which is illegal and unsafe.  I am glad I did not trade in my old Lexus, as that is what I am driving now, anticipating more headaches to come on getting the Acura fixed and wondering ""what next?"". The good is that it is beautiful, has wonderful handling and acceleration (my favorite is Sport Mode), decent seats, and cargo space as large as the Lexus.  The paddle shifters are great fun. It has nice speakers, and when CarPlay works, it is fun calling up all kinds of music I do not own using the optional Apple music subscription. The ACC works well, has 4 different following distance settings and will reliably start and stop the car on freeway and in traffic, I have carefully tested
 it, has not failed a single time .  The fit and finish are good except for sharp edges on the upper windows when I touch them to close the doors (and of course, unless the front glass has a design defect, e.g, if that is why it is already cracked).  The center console which doubles as an arm rest is not as big or ergonomically friendly as on the Lexus.  The driver blind spot is worse, even when I turn my head, so I really have to check the flashing blind spot light before changing lanes ( I do not trust it yet). The lane drift protection does not do much, just flashes a dim light you have to be looking at to notice, does not move me back to my lane. I expected better collision protection features.  All in, a disappointing purchase for this price and I now worry about taking it on long trips.

acura,rdx,2019,Sonia Petriello, 08/17/2018,Regretting my decision on RDX 2019,neu,"I wanted to love this car, my boyfriend has been leasing Acura's for over 10 years and loves his TLX and has been harping me to get into an Acura.  Up until this year I thought the RDX was ugly and since they just revamped everything I decided to get the  2019 RDX.  I wanted the A-spec but the dealer made it very un-affordable for me so I went with the base model since I can use the Apple Play.  I feel there is way too much going on with the technology, so many times I felt like my eyes were not on the road because I was trying to navigate the system and the mouse pad is annoying.  The Auto Idle button is a nuisance and I wish the back-up camera beeped when you are coming close to an object.  All my other leases of different makes always had this, Acura is lacking with certain things.  I also miss having Power Fold mirrors which was on my Kia and Acura it's a manual process, so now when I pull into my tight driveway, I have to manually pull in driver-side mirror and hope I don't hit the passenger side mirror because I'm not leaning across the car to pull that one in!!!   I finally started getting the hang of it and my third week in the home screen freezes and does not turn off draining off the battery.  I bought it back to the dealer, they had the car for 6 days and couldn't replicate the issue, so they did a hard reset and told me they HOPE that fixes the problem.  HOPE now has me wondering when and if this is going to happen again and where will I be when it does happen, as if it does happen it needs to get into the dealer immediately because I'll have a dead battery otherwise.  I am very disappointed and maybe should have waited longer to read other people's reviews before I made this decision.  I can only pray that I will not have additional issues with this vehicle over the next three years since I only had it for a month and already had issues.  I am hoping that all this goes away over my leasing term otherwise I will not be returning to Acura. I also forgot to add there is no CD player in this truck either, another con.

acura,rdx,2019,Mspenc45, 02/22/2019,No remorse!,pos,"REading reviews on the RDX prior to purchase had me concerned, especially about the technology systems. I cannot discount the bad experiences of other owners, but have nothing but praise for ours. My wife has decided it is now her car instead of mine, and suggested buying a second one. Is it perfect no, but close enough. Only dislikes are the seat design makes them pretty stiff on the bottom panels. Essentially the leather has to stretch to allow for any conformity to your bottom side, not a huge deal. No Android auto yet, but I personally do not like Android Auto and turn it off in my GT350. The RDX Advanced is just an all around pleasure to drive, the lane keep assist an adaptive cruise control are better than any other brand we've tried. If I had a wish list, I think they should have included the remote key fob start, and some changes in the stitching for the seat bottoms.  We are getting right at 25mpg average.

acura,rdx,2019,Miwuk kid, 07/01/2019,"Almost hit a home run, but instead flied out",neu,"This is our 6th Acura. We have had the 1st and 2nd generation RDX’s, 2012 and 2015 versions. We also are currently driving a 2016 MDX. The new RDX is by far the best one (of the past RDX’s) from a design and look perspective. We had a 2015 Audi Q5 and the RDX compares nicely to the Audi in fit and finish, but the 2018 Audi Q5 which I’ve been in is a much smoother car. 
My driving experience is pretty good as long as I don’t use Apple Car Play. The ride is smooth and comfortable. I do notice some transmission hiccups as the car warms up and ascends a small hill. I don’t notice any other problems once the car is warmed up. I have owned the car for 8 months and have had many problems with the technology. After purchasing the car, we were driving home from the dealership (120 miles away) and the audio system shut down and there was no sound the rest of the way home. That happened at least 3 more times. One day I came home and the screen would not turn off. After 30 minutes I called the dealership and they wanted me to drive it in. Another 120 miles, get a loaner and return the next day, that is 8 hours of driving and almost 500 miles. I decided to disconnect the battery and that fixed the problem and it never happened again. There were a lot of problems here and there with the entertainment system but almost all got fixed with the last update. 
However, the Acura software engineers really messed up the Apple Car Play interface. I had a Honda CRV with CarPlay for 18 months and have driven a Kia Soul for 2 weeks and had virtually no problems with them. In the RDX it fails every time I am in the car and using it. It will start distorting the sound and then shuts down. It takes around 5 minutes for it come back. I switch over to Bluetooth and use it to listen to navigation and music. But when CarPlay resets it automatically turns off the Bluetooth and starts playing again which is a problem because if I am in the car long enough it will do it again. 
Which brings me to the real issue with the car. In the 8 months that I have driven the car I have only put 2,600 miles on it. My wife and I don’t want the aggravation of dealing with the weird problems with the audio. If we are going to town, we will drive the car, but any trip of more than 5 miles we will not drive it. We have no confidence in the car and Acura to fix it. It is a major issue with the car and there are numerous complaints about it on all the forums but it is beyond their capability to fix. 
I almost bought a BMW X3 and would have because the dealership is 4 miles from my house, but they wouldn’t sell the car for a fair price. I was hesitant about buying the RDX because it was a major departure from the previous versions. I did and now regret it.  Since I bought my car the BMW dealership has had 2 almost brand new RDX’s on their lot because of them getting traded in. It makes we wonder when I will make it a 3rd one. 
After 15 months of ownership there have been no fixes to the problems. At the shop in Tennessee while getting the MDX fixed I was talking to the head of service about Acura fixing the problem and he said they were trying to fix it. I was alone, 2 other customers were trying to find out the same thing.

acura,rdx,2019,Faze 4 Orchestras, 10/08/2019,Shame on Acura for their RDX,neg,"The RDX is an unfit car having a computer screen glitch which causing the battery to do dead without a fix with no solution and no recourse. MBUSA waived lease payments until a problem they had on a new E-Class was resolved. Acura says ""there is nothing we could do"" "
acura,rdx,2019,NJMcky, 12/22/2018,2019 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech,pos,"Just bought this week my new 2019 Acura RDX Tech SH-AWD, Silver Ext, Expresso int.  Did a trade in of my 2010 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech. So you can consider a like to like trade in. Have below comments on the new car - 1.) For person switching from auto stick transmission to electronic button transmission is a big change. While doing K turn was used to doing it quicker with stick shift. But with button you will need to come to a complete stop of vehicle before switching the button to drive. Bit of a hassle while doing city driving like NYC. b) While driving on highway and stepping up on gas, i can hear the noise ""vroom vroom"".. makes me feel as though I am driving a german car.  c) Brake sometimes had to push hard for vehicle to stop. Not sure if this is due to low brakes or some issue with brake.. Will drive some more before taking to dealer. d) Car engine stops in traffic light if the ""A"" button is not engaged. Got to get used to this to ensure engine doesn't stop while on a traffic light. Bit annoying if you forget to have this button engaged. e) Car has auto headlight on by default. This is annoying sometimes in city driving as head light gets on when no traffic is in front, but for a sec the opposite driver will see high beam and curse me for having it on city driving. Will need to figure how to switch this off.

More update - Acura has really screwed the GPS in new car. Earlier my home address route it used to pick up from my usual destination but now gps is lost and keep searching. I liked my 2010 Acura RDX gps. It was much faster and accurate. 2) Still feel low brakes and will need hard braking sometimes to stop the car. Feel brakes are not very sensitive and need to be slammed sometimes to stop the car. 3) in city driving getting 15 mpg not 20 as advertised. Will go long drive this weekend and check on hghway mileage.

acura,rdx,2019,Happy Acura Owner, 10/04/2018,LOVE THIS CAR!,pos,"I love, love, love this car!!  My last car was a BMW X5, and when it was time to replace it I thought for sure I was going go with a BMW sedan.  But then I discovered I didn't like sedans anymore.   I test drove several smaller SUVs - including the BMW X3 (blah), AudiQ5 (too plain) and Volvo XC60 (seats were uncomfortable weird touchscreen system).  The Acura RDX was amazing the first time I drove it and it still is!   I have had no problems with the Nav system, and I love how Apple CarPlay works so well.  It's a peppy fast car and makes me happy!"
acura,rdx,2019,Steve, 09/27/2018,Acceleration issues,neg,"The RDX on its surface is a great vehicle. I have problems with getting the vehicle to respond to throttle inputs in traffic which creates a safety issue. Many times the car will not accelerate, taking between 1-3 seconds before responding to throttle inputs. This happens regardless of the driving or transmission mode. The factory has been poor to respond on the issue and I feel this could lead to accidents. Meeting with an Acura factory representative ended with being told the vehicle is responding as designed and they suggested I shift it manually. So if you like your vehicle to respond quickly when you hit the accelerator, this may not be the best car for you. Audi Q5 responds much more naturally.

After a year I feel mostly the same way. I have added a PRL intercooler and flashed the ECU with Hondata software. These two things dramatically improve the responsiveness and somewhat remove the laggy throttle. It’s better but not gone. Power is better overall as well. Vehicle still seems like shift logic is confused regularly.

acura,rdx,2019,Buck Thorn, 12/07/2018,This is the fourth RDX I have leased.,pos,"The 2019 model is an improvement over the previous models in terms of handling and comfort. The entertainment and information system is not user friendly. I have had the car for three months and I am just getting accustomed to the system but it still has drawbacks , especially trying to use it while driving. My frustration with the electronics have almost overshadowed the fact that this is a very good vehicle in all other respects. My wife just leased a new Subaru, and the information system is much friendlier. Additionally the local Subaru dealers offer a trainer who will reach out to help you with the vehicle. The RDX is a better fit for my driving, but the Acura dealers can't match the local Subaru dealers in customer support

acura,rdx,2019,Al, 07/31/2018,Vehicle Wrapped Around a Computer Center - Update2,pos,"We've owned this vehicle for 18 months now and have put about 11k miles on it.  While other reviewers have had significant quality/reliability issues, we have not had any issues whatsoever.  My wife LOVES this car.  It's pretty.  Very responsive.  We live in a hilly, snowy area and the handling is wonderful.  Our gas mileage falls right in line with the advertised - averaging about 23 mpg combined.  Note that when the turbos kick in the acceleration is awesome, but you certainly won't get the expected mpg - more like 17 to 19.  So if you want the thrill, you will pay for it.   The navigation system is virtually unusable.  You can't name the stored addresses.  We don't use Bluetooth or Apple play.  The maintenance minder not only tells you when tire pressure is low, it provides the pressure in individual tires.  The sound system is great.  Compared to the competition, it's about $10k cheaper for the same features.  Put a Garmin on your dash and relax.

acura,rdx,2019,Manny P, 08/28/2018,The 2019 RDX Brought Me Back,pos,"Had owned a 2016 RDX and was pleased, so I was excited with the 2019 redesign -- now am extremely pleased having purchased it. Very comfortable, smooth ride and a lot of great features for the price. Got the tech package as I have never been good with estimating the distance between me and other cars when parking. The sensors are amazing and I'm finding I have more space around me then I had thought. One feature I'm hoping they address, is the navigation is fixed at a certain ""view."" If you zoom back on the map, it does not track as you drive. A minor quibble. The sound system is beyond amazing, and very glad I made it back to Acura.

acura,rdx,2019,frank h., 03/15/2019,RDX 2016 had better features that were removed,neu,"Infotainment system hard to use. In 2016 navi system you could save identifier with favorite. In 2019 only address can be saved. 2016 beeped when lane departure activated, not 2019. Just had an infotainment system update in the hopes that a bug I had would be fixed, but it wasn't. When trying to use voice command sometimes it works, then I get Voice System initializing and the voice system freezes until the car is turned off and restarted. No easy way to report this glitch to Acura. Dealer and customer relations certainly not briefed sufficiently in the new info system. Car drives well, gas mileage leaves a little to be desired. Comfort is great.

acura,rdx,2019,sadrdxowner, 07/23/2019,Transmission failure,neg,"With only a few thousand miles, the transmission simply died. The car wouldn't start because of the transmission error, I couldn't even get it to turn on Accessory mode. The Acura technicians were not able to get it into neutral to load it onto a flatbed tow truck. Acura still has the car (it's been over 2 weeks) and they installed a new transmission just a few days into having it. Why are they still working on it? I was told that they basically have not been able to get the new transmission to work correctly. If you read enough reviews, you will see that the RDX is having  issues with transmissions among other things. I have been a loyal Honda/Acura customer for 15 years (this was our 8th, but first Acura) and I'm not getting much of a response from Acura. I bought this for Acura's history of reliability, but clearly something has changed. How Acura responds to these problems will be a tell-tale sign of their commitment to customers going forward.
"
acura,rdx,2019,My Last Acura, 08/29/2019,Technology destroys driving experience,neg,"Like many other reviewers, I've had trouble with the infotainment system since taking delivery in August, 2018.  I've installed all upgrades and spoken to Acura customer service and the dealers who were not helpful at all.  My problems include:

- Extreme latency.  Frequent system boot times of 2 minutes or greater, failure to load SiriusXM regularly, unresponsive trackpad.  Maddening to use.

- Bluetooth buzzing.  This is not related to interference while driving.  If I'm talking on the phone, enter the car and the handset hands off to bluetooth, I get intermittent buzzing.

- Transmission fails to upshift when traveling downhill in certain situations, causing the tachometer to ""redline""

- Auto high beams activate even when this feature has been deactivated

- Auto idle shutoff is maddening, even though you can disable it (not permanently, there is a button you can push each time you start the car).

This is my fifth and last Acura.  Had I known I would have these problems I never would have bought this car.  I generally don't write reviews, this car is so bad I wrote this one.

I’ve shown them videos (I managed to capture it while fearing for my life) and they agree there is a problem, but can’t find it. The best they can do is wash the car for me.

acura,rdx,2019,Greg Ormerod, 10/07/2018,A Good Car for the Money,pos,"I had a 2012 Infiniti EX35 and had planned to buy the 2019 Infiniti QX50 but became concerned about its quirky CVT transmission, throttle issues, and outdated infotainment system. Therefore, I bought the 2019 RDX with the Advance package three months ago and so far it has been great. I like the way the doors close with a solid thunk. The build quality is solid and the design is sporty. I like that this design is all its own instead of an upscale CRV. The seating is comfortable - especially with the 16-way adjustable seating. I have read some complaints about the complexity of the infotainment system touch pad and the push-button transmission controls . Consumer Reports is especially harsh on both categories. However, I have found that both are quite easy to use. The infotainment touch pad functionality is based on cell phones and tablets. If you need a menu option that is out of view to the right, then you swipe to the left to bring it into view and then select it. If you need a menu option that is out of view to the bottom, then you swipe up to bring it into view. Once you get used to this principle, it is easy to use. It's display screen is mounted high so it's within your field of vision when watching the road. The push button transmission controls also require some adjustment time, but are logical and easy to use. There is a definite difference between Comfort and Sport modes. Acceleration is better in Sport, but the ride becomes more stiff and the steering wheel tightens up - as would be expected. Therefore, I use Sport mode when driving highways during my weekly commute and then dial it back to Comfort mode for local driving during the weekends. The gas mileage average has been as high as 26 MPG during highway driving but can drop down to the 22 MPG range after extensive local driving. It won't ride quite as nice as its German counterparts, but it feels solid and stable on the road, and its price is much better. In fact, for the amount of features and technology this car includes, and for the way it performs and handles, its a great car for the money.
Update (10/2020): I have now had the car for over two years and have had no issues with it.

It's really fun to drive ( I like the quick shifts from the 10 speed when I accelerate hard). The 3D stereo is great. I actually learned to use the True Touchpad Interface in a couple of days. The USB port for playing my iPod has been troublesome. It will just lock up and stop playing. I use the Bluetooth method for my iPod but it doesn't have the features available with the USB. I also really like the storage options in the rear. I use the underfloor storage quite a bit. The car has performed very well since I purchased it. I enjoy it's performance on the highway. I can enter the freeway confidently without concern I might get run over by someone doing 80 mph. The only dislike I have is the Idle Stop. I don't care for this feature but it can be disabled. It must be disabled every time you start the car.

The dealer now uses my video as an example since more of the same car have com in with the exact same problem. I love the car and was very excited for it. Its in the shop as we speak, but a 2 month old car should 0 issues with it. Hopefully this gets fixed because this will be the third time going back and it's becoming annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Alan Bernard, 08/22/2018,Nav is a deal breaker,pos,"I was about to pull the trigger and order the RDX SH-AWD Advanced. It has everything I'm looking for at a very competitive price. Unfortunately, I use my $150 Garmin- on -a-suction-cup Navigation a great deal and there are two important things it will do that the RDX's nav won't. First, there is no way to give a stored addresses a name. so if you have thirty addresses stored you have to remember which is the doctor, which is the dentist, and which is the Acura Dealer. That is unsatisfactory. I'm told prior years RDX's could store by name. Secondly there is no way to store your current location and give it a name. So if I'm driving through the mountains and stumble across a fish pond, I can't store my current location and name it ""Hidden lake"" I guess I'm off to the Volvo dealer to see if the XC-60 can do any better. Rats!"
acura,rdx,2019,Stacy, 10/23/2018,2019 RDX-Love It!!,pos,"I just bought this two days ago.  I love it so far.  I traded in 2015 RDX with Tech package and got the Advance Package.  It has almost as many features as my husbands Mercedes Benz E class but cost about 25k less.  It is a huge upgrade over my 2015.  The interior really feels like a luxury car.  There are a couple of things I don’t love.  The idle/stop feature has to be turned off every time you start the vehicle.  Idle/stop does not activate in the Sport plus mode, which is nice.  I also don’t like the feel of the brakes. I feel like I have to push the pedal all the way to the floor before it engages. I love the redesigned cargo area.  It seems so much bigger.

acura,rdx,2019,john middelkamp, 11/30/2018,What more can you want?,pos,"We actually need an SUV to haul things back and forth to our lake house.  We previously owned 2 MDXs but decided, since we never used the 3rd row of seats that a smaller SUV would suffice.  It has.  We have owned the 2019 since the end of June.  I had shopped a number of other makes actually thinking that I wanted a German car.  The Audi was the highest contender but my two criteria were seats that cooled and blind spot alerts.  To get that on the Audi I had to go to their deluxe model which was fine except it only came with a black interior which my wife really didn't want.  There were other things but in the end, unless I wanted to go to an 80,000 Porsche,  this car had everything I wanted, and more, at 10,000 less.  I have never had a problem with my two previous Acuras.  My complaints are really minor:  garage door opener is small, side view mirrors don't fold in when car is turned off, navigation image screen could be sharper.  I have friends who just got a new Mercedes and a new BMW.  Both of them think I made the best purchase.

acura,rdx,2019,BENOIT, 09/26/2018,Macura,pos,"Powertrain is extremely powerful, i drove all the Acura line up, the only vehicles that feel faster than the RDX is the NSX which is a sport car. The 10 speeds transmission is flawless compare to the Lexus RX 350 8speeds is horrible and the  zf  9 speeds on the MDX & TLX is scary. Great MPG., comfortable ,fast and the fake exhaust sound is  great. I drove subsequently , RX350, NX, RDX and the BMW x3 my choice was easy , I bought the A spec SH-AWD.

acura,rdx,2019,Trevor Clark, 12/05/2018,No Regrets,pos,"Cross shopped with X3, Q5, GLC300. Acura has the best value proposition. The overall package is excellent but I HATE the touch pad thing. It is impossible for me to use while driving as my hand bounces all over the place and wrist pad is in the wrong place for stabilization. I love the power, the easy parking/maneuverability, the ELS Audio, and the heads up display. I’ve owned it about a year and a half so I’m out of the honeymoon period, and I would make the same choice again. "
acura,rdx,2019,Bill in Pittsburgh, 05/22/2019,"""X"" This from your vehicle choices",neg,"I purchased the RDX over other vehicle lines (BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity) after extensive research.  The final determinant for me was the perceived quality which Honda builds into its vehicles.  I have a CRV, and I traded in a BMW. I have owned a number of cars over the years both foreign and domestic, and the CRV by far was the best in terms of reliability and cost of maintenance.  Much to my chagrin, the Acura RDX does not live up to the same standard.  With a bit over 1000 miles on the vehicle, I have had two instances where I have lost my radio and/or GPS function.  This after one stint in the service department already.  Definitely not what I expected from Honda, or from a vehicle which is not inexpensive by any means.  "

Nothing but infotainment connectivity headaches, screen blackouts, CarPlay unavailability, and transmission issue at 2,000 miles. The ride and new styling are great, but hassles with infotainment issues, upgrades, and six trips (one was flat-bed tow in) within first 10 months is ridiculous. Presently am considering other car options. To those who have not experienced/or poo-pooed the infotainment issues, consider yourselves lucky!

acura,rdx,2019,Aggravated Beyond Belief, 09/13/2019,Love Hate - Glad I leased,neu,"When I first got this car I was in love. I loved how plush the seats were and how the suspension just soaked up the bumps. I envisioned myself on long road trips but instead I can barely stand to be in the car for anything other than a quick commute. 
I’ll start by saying that I love the idea of all the technology that is in the car and for me the touch pad is not that big of a deal. However, I frequently have to take my eyes off the road to make sure I am selecting the correct options on the screen and from my experience this can lead to dangerous situations. Forget about using voice command. It is often too slow to respond, doesn’t respond or gets the options wrong.
Love... love... love the ELS studio 3D audio system. This system truly does sound amazing.  What I discovered though is that it only sounds great from a digital source such as satellite radio. Listening to the regular radio sounds just like any other crappy radio.
Was never really able to get the navigation system to work correctly. Apple car play is inconsistent and now as a rule if I need to navigate anywhere I will just use the maps app direct from my phone. Also, at start up it will take the radio a long time to boot up. Sometimes I will arrive at my destination before the system loads. Dealership has tried updates but they never work.
Now the really frustrating part of this car and why I’m so glad I leased. The transmission... from a stop it feels like the car is in 2nd or 3rd gear. It’s so sluggish going getting off the line. I absolutely hate it. The breaks squeal and it has been to the dealership multiple times for this. Dealership finally said that it’s now a known issue and currently no fix. They even told me that changing the break rotors won’t help.  Finally, the reason why I’m so glad I leased. I would have overlooked every other short coming of this car but this next issue is just driving me over the edge. From day one there has been a rattle coming from the the passenger side head liner near the speaker that is directly over the passengers head. This rattle drives me and the passenger nuts. The car has been in the shop several times. Each time there has been no clear fix. Now, an additional rattle has started coming from the headliner where the controls for the sunroof are. May seem minor but it’s a huge distraction. Back to the dealership we go. :(

acura,rdx,2019,KDixon, 10/14/2019,Info/Entertainment System Not Ready for Rollout,neu,"Several issues with the Info/ Entertainment system
Contact list takes 2-3 minutes to upload from phone, so I can't make a handsfree call right away.  Other cars upload the Contacts once and retain it. 
Changing stations with a voice command takes 3-4 minutes. The command is immediately acknowledged,  but it will continue playing the same station 
Can't change volume or station for 2-3 minutes after startup 
Navigation directions on Heads up display don't match main screen or voice directions. Heads up shows last turn, not next turn 
Dealer can't fix these issues, but states it's a common and known issue with no fix yet.  

I've had the car for 1 year  

Ride, comfort, and performance are all good

acura,rdx,2019,Adrian Pineda, 06/20/2018,Very Good!,pos,"I test drove the new RDX today. It had the AWD/Tech package (only because they didn't have the ASpec or Advance in AWD available. Pros: SEATS! The seats are super confortable (seating position and visibility are great). Most materials are top quality. It drives nice and smooth and the 2.0 Turbo really moves the car. The touchpad is easy to use; I don't understand experts who ding it for its complexity. Cons: wheel choices not great, some materials feel not as upscale  (e.g. the steering wheel and other panels not covered with leather) The a/c display seems outdated. Over all, a very good contender that has its price as one of its strong points against the competition. Acura reliability in my experience will draw customers that don't trust BMW's after initial warranty. I'm still test driving the BMW X3 and the Audi Q5.
