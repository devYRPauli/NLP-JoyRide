acura,mdx,2017,Beau Davis, 07/25/2017,New MDX,pos,"I traded in a 2014 MDX because I got a great deal. The improvements in ride, navigation and interior comfort made it toatally worthwile. I really love this car. I just wish the Avdvance Pkg came with a 2nd row bench seat option, because I would have gone with that.

acura,mdx,2017,KDH, 10/05/2017,Roadside Assistance from Hell,neg,"Had a dead battery. Acura Roadside Assistance sent Royal Towing. The guy didn't know how to open hood. Couldn't jump. Second row operator couldn't jump either. He couldn't tow because he needed special tool to put car in neutral. Push button transmission doesn't work without battery power. Third tow truck driver said he wasn't going to waste his time unless cash was paid. Acura Roadside Assistance is suppose to be free? Fourth Towing county, Advantage finally got it. They were a pleasure to deal with unlike Acura Roadside Assistance personal.

acura,mdx,2017,Sandra Turman, 03/05/2019,Acura’s are wonderful cars. Very good value .,pos,"This is my sixth or seventh Acura.  I have never had any problem at all.  I thought I did once but I found out I was causing the problem by having two keys in car that was confusing the signals.

acura,mdx,2017,Michael DeWaal, 04/16/2019,MDX beats Audi Q5/Q7 and Lexus RX series SUVs....,pos,"See this for additional support - only the MDX wheel clutches engaged when needed vs. the Audi and Lexus competitors: https://youtu.be/k1i9zuVrWnY    .  This video was my clincher.
The 2017 MDX has the lowest TCO and repairs on the 5 year average, with the best resale/residuals vs. its competitors.  This is the most capable SUV of the 3 in this price range.  Higher priced brands tend towards much higher maintenance and lower reliabilities.  I don't think they are worth their prices given that reliability metric.

acura,mdx,2017,Paul C, 07/03/2019,Great SUV for the money,pos,"Recently purchased the AWD MDX with Technology (2 yrs old and 3700 miles- what a find) and could not be more satisfied. The ONLY this I would improve on is the auto shifting from 1st to 2nd gear- not as smooth as it could be. The only change I would like (for me) is making the third room seating optional- would like the extra storage.  My previous vehicle was a 2015 lexus 350 which I loved. Therefore I was somewhat hesitant to change to an Acura - what I found was the Acura is more comfortable, quicker, and much more pleasurable to drive. I must say I am surprised - but thrilled!

acura,mdx,2017,My “go-cart” features, 12/02/2019,The BEST SUV Go-Cart money can buy,pos,"I love my MDX except for the transmission and the “feature” that turns off the engine upon stopping. The salesman told me that feature can be turned off in the system settings but it can not be. It can be turned off every time the vehicle is started but it’s extremely annoying do that. If that’s a feature then a tooth ache is enjoyable. I’m not sure what Honda is doing with this 9-speed transmission but it’s horrible. When I was a kid we used to make go-carts and have pulleys and belts with bailing wire holding everything together. The go-card would jump and jerk to get up to speed. And often slip and be unpredictable. That’s what this 9-speed transmission reminds me of except it’s in a $55K vehicle. Ridiculous!

acura,mdx,2017,great car with one clay foot, 12/19/2020,Great car with one glaring clay foot,pos,"Car is excellent in all respects looks, power train, suspension, interior and space utilization as well as gas mileage and adequate power. The one glaring fault is the Voice recognition software ( not the navigation which works fine) . Extremely hard to get voice recognition to determine what you are saying; forcing me to use my cellphone to accomplish destination instructions. Hopefully the new MDX with carplay and android will permit cellphone use through the nav suatem to provide adequate voice recognition..

acura,mdx,2018,Chris B, 06/01/2018,"2018 MDX Tech..1st Acura, Has some misteps",neu,"Update: After 10,000 miles I traded in my MDX. I had to many issues with Air conditioning Compressor/ fans etc and it being in the shop for multiple days at a time For my liking. I liked the vehicle overall but reliability is questionable.


Reading some other reviews I can concur with, the break clicking noise when backing up, The strange distorting haze on the passenger side while looking from the driver side of windshield and vice versa. My biggest issue is the acceleration off the line. When a light turns green and you ease on the gas, it almost does nothing, and then Jerks and accelerates hard. This is enough not to want to drive especially in areas with a lot of stop and go or lights. The dash is dated but i believe it will change to what the 2019 RDX has in 2020. Make sure to get a version with SH-AWD it makes a large difference in the driving dynamics. I still think its funny how the moon roof shade is completely manual like a base model civic from the 2000's. At this price point all things should be automated. Although i'm glad for Apple Car play, it defeats the purpose when you have to use the control knob to access the functions, seems to be one of those, well here ya go type of updates.
"
acura,mdx,2018,SS, 02/15/2018,Blurry windshield,neu,"There is a problem with the passenger front windshield. It's blurry along the edge and hard to look out especially to check for on coming traffic from the right side. Brought it in to the dealership, the district manager checked it, and noted all the other 2018's have the same issue, but said nothing could be done. It is a hazard to drive and see properly out that window. There service department took photos and agreed there is a problem. Now I am stuck driving this car for the next 3 years knowing that an accident could happen due to the defect that they won't correct.

acura,mdx,2018,Leo, 02/17/2018,Base SHAWD Bang for the Buck!,pos,"After researching, haggling, test driving, and repeating this process, we ended up with the 2018 MdX Base with SH AWD.  So here's the deal, after test driving all the trim levels, I decided on the base model. Reason being, it comes with all the options that you will ever need. The tech package is  advantageous if you REALLY need the blind spot monitor. However this car is very easy to drive/switch lanes and is proportioned very well. And keep in mind, tech package adds a pretty penny to the purchase price.  I had the new body X5 but was paying an arm and leg in lease payments so immediately got rid of it, meanwhile the MDX has more options and is half the price.  But going back to the car, it drives well, size is relatively small thus making it easy to drive for smaller statured people, has great utility, and actually fun to drive so long as you have the SHAWD.  The only drawback is the infotainment system. However, with the 2018's having apple carplay, it makes it bearable.  The shifter is annoying in the beginning, but easy to get used to. The Infiniti QX60 is probably the only viable competitor but to get standard options with AWD that you get in the mdx , it will drive up the price significantly. Added bonus is you get a fleet of standard safety and driver aid options with the base. If youre in the market, just go with the base model with SHAWD. Youre welcome!

acura,mdx,2018,Thong, 08/08/2018,Very disapointed,neg,"I do not recommend this suv to anybody, the people at acura now a day their favorite word is normal, they don’t want to take responsibility on their car.....Bs ACURA .i bought this car brand new and i drive speed between 55 to 60 mph and feel the vibration on the steering wheel and took the car tothe dealer couple time to fix the problem but it’s still there. They couldn’t fix the problem, so finally they Told me that it’ normal for the mdx that the steering vibration at that speed, bs. No new car should never virbration at that speed at all.>......

acura,mdx,2018,David S., 01/04/2018,Updated Review After 2 years of Ownership,pos,"After owning a few of these MDXs, this one is the worst! My wife loves this one but I really hate all the different buttons you have to push or slide to engage everything. I hate the way the locks unlock when you walk by the car if you have your key fob on you and it does NOT lock itself back! It should only unlock or lock when I want it too!! Lane assist is annoying because you have to keep moving the wheel or it times our VERY fast, it should just stay set! Acura Navi & voice has always sucked and it still does, Acura refuses to listen to their customers & switch to Garmin. Still needs a panoramic sun roof and heads up. The front seats do not provide enough comfort under the thigh area.  This one did not come standard with all wheel drive and I really miss it but it is not worth paying the extra money they are trying to gouge you for now. Acura needs to look at how much better the rims on other MFRs look. Even the so called Acura premium wheels they up-charge for do not look that great & you should not have to pay extra to have nice wheels anyway, just put descent wheels to begin with & give us a choice of silver, black, etc. It was still the best bang for the buck and it has great utilitarian value with great layout, just wanted to point out to Acura what I want fixed or changed for the next one. If Acura would start listening to their customers and front line salesmen, they could improve in so many areas and increase sales. Our 1993 Acura Legend LS Coupe is still funner, more enjoyable, user friendly, sporty, stylish, and more comfortable than most of what they offer today and Acura really needs to find their way back. It took Acura far to long to fix the RDX. The RLX is still a dog. They ruined the TSX (we owned two) with the ugly cheap looking ILX. They did not leave any heritage in the NSX at all. Why all the no name letter meaningless prefixes?? Acura does not act on feed back and the point is proven with the bird beak error!!

acura,mdx,2018,Gary Baker, 08/27/2018,Too Many Intermittent Issues,pos,"2018 Acura MDX Sport Hybrid, Advanced Package Review

We took delivery of the vehicle in April 2018, and have had numerous problems with the vehicle since we bought it.  The advance package has the seat, steering wheel, and outside mirrors memory positioning system.  Intermittently, the steering wheel does not return to the memory position of the driver.  It stays all the way up, which is the exit vehicle position.  

I have an open report with Acura Client Relations.  I've had the vehicle at the dealer four times to correct the problem, but they say they cannot duplicate the issue.  On the fourth visit, the vehicle malfunctioned while the service writer was present, but the dealership still contended they could not confirm the issue.  Ultimately, they said Honda knows the issue is present, but in their opinion, it only malfunctions when both keys are present.  My response was that it seems unusual that Honda knowingly has a malfunction in their system, but chooses to ignore it.  Just to be clear, the issue happens whether both keys are present or whether only one key is present.

For some reason, Acura changed the way they receive traffic information for their vehicles.  Acura now uses HD Radio signals to receive traffic information for the 2018 MDX.  I would assume Acura uses HD Radio signals for all their vehicles.  The problem is, unless you're in a major metropolitan area, you do not get traffic information.  As a result, when you are driving in heavy traffic, the navigation does not reroute you around heavy traffic.  I have a 2016 Acura RDX, and the traffic flow works fine.  I believe Acura used to use some sort of satellite signals to receive the information, but for some reason changed to HD Radio signals.  Whatever happened to ""if it isn't broke, don't fix it""!

I've had multiple other intermittent issues with the vehicle as well.  Sometimes I have to press the Reverse button several times before the car actually shifts into gear.  When accelerating normally, the transmission seems to stay in lower gears for a long time, and the engine stays at 3,500 to 4,000 RPM, even though you are at a constant speed.  For some reason, I started getting between 16 and 17 mpg, which is what prompted my inquiring about the proper operation of the climate control system.  Then all of a sudden, I started getting what I was accustomed to seeing.  

Acura Owners Manuals are horrible.  Because of the drastic mpg variance, I've been trying to figure out the Climate Control system.  I have had open dialog with the salesman who sold me the car for over a month.  Apparently Acura sales and technical personnel don't know how the climate control system works either.  No one has contacted me with some sort of information for over a month.  

The MDX Sport Hybrid is actually a nice car.  Very quiet and smooth riding.  Their estimated fuel efficiency is a little off though.  I can get about 25 mpg on the highway, and around 21 mpg city.  Overall I get about 22 mpg.  We traded in our 2010 Lexus 450H, which is a Hybrid as well, for the MDX.  We got around 30 mpg highway and 23 city with the Lexus, and overall we got 25 mpg from the day we bought it until we traded it in.

The open case with their Client Relations has been a challenge since I opened it five weeks ago, July 17th.  From July 19th until July 25th, I left voicemail messages on the case managers direct line, and never got a call back.  When she finally did call me back July 25th, she claimed she never received any of my messages.  Apparently their phone system at Honda also has intermittent problems.  When last I talked to the case manager on August 8th, she told me she would be back in touch with me by August 10th.  That is the last I've heard from her, and today is August 26th.  I guess it must be another intermittent problem.

It's hard for me to understand why Honda/Acura has such lousy
 customer service.  Starting with their sales staff, to their service department, right up to their Client Relations.  When you spend $60,000.00 for a luxury vehicle, I would think the manufacture would be more concerned about their customers.

acura,mdx,2018,Brittany B., 08/05/2018,Getting out of 1st is the worst!,neu,"This car is beautiful- it rides smoothly has a lot of awesome standard technology BUT accelerating is awful! It is super slow coming out of first gear & that alone is a deal breaker for me. The other thing I am not crazy about is the touch screen climate control. It takes your eyes off the road as you try to adjust the temp b/c there are several touches to move the temp.

acura,mdx,2018,Hitech, 03/19/2018,Good car with some challenges,pos,"I own this SUV for over a year.  I like the drivability and overall comfort and safety.  The built in smarts are very good and easy to navigate.  The only nagging problem is breaking, particularly when reversing from park, it makes clicking sound. Been to dealer couple of times- they acknowledged the issue but no solution.  I am told it is a new feature of this model. The sound is very annoying to me and unfortunately Acura can’t fix it.  Very sad! Contacted Acura USA- same answer.

acura,mdx,2018,Charlie N., 02/06/2018,This is our second MDX,pos,"Love this car.  Love the transmission.  Love the gas mileage on the freeway.  Love the night time visibility with the LED lights.  I have owned this car now for a little over 2 months and put about 5.5k on it.  The trans has 9 speeds.  It has drive, sport and manual via paddle shifters.   I like using the sport mode going down hill and  when I really need to get up and go.  Put it in sport at a stop light and it is a rocket ship taking off.  O.K. not a Tesla, but for as big as it is it gets up and goes.  I haven't driven up to Tahoe yet so I can't say how it performs climbing the hills.  If it is anything like the previous 2004 MDX, I am sure it will do great.  I am happy with the gas mileage on the freeway.  I have achieved 25 mpg at 75 mph.  That is on the flat.  City mileage is around 16 to 18 mpg.  I love the LED headlights.  I don't like that the headlights do not self adjust when the car is loaded.  For the price and that it is the Advanced Package, Acura should have installed load sensors and headlight adjustment motors.  On coming traffic really does not like to be blinded by LED lights.  That is a big letdown in my opinion for a '17 SUV.   I am not real happy with the voice activation everything.  It is very clunky, does not understand your voice and very slow.  If you have not memorized the commands it will just frustrate the hell out of you.  I also don't like the little upper screen and the very grainy picture for parking assist.  My '04 MDX with the rear view camera had a more clear, crisp picture.  I don't like that I couldn't get 18"" or 19"" wheels.  They are 20"" and are not low profile tires or run-flats.  I wanted a smaller wheel so it won't bend so easily when you hit a pot hole.  Aluminum wheels bend easy and are really, really expensive to replace.   I am not real happy with the active cruise control.  I was zooming along at 75 mph the other day with the car in front of me going the same speed.  We were in the middle lane of a three line freeway.  A car from the fast lane decided it want to be in the far right lane.  With no blinker, they moved between me and the car in front and then to the far right lane.  The active cruise freaked out, slammed on the brakes (collision avoidance) and sounded the alarm and the flashing orange light on the dash.  It scared the $h_T out of me!!!  When I bought the car I asked if the radar could be turned off and the cruise control be regular cruise.  ""Yes"" they told me.  No you  actually can't.  I tried.  Today I was listening to a podcast on my i-phone (6) when I got a phone call.  I answered the call and I could her the caller, but she could not hear me.  This is the first time I have had a problem with an incoming call.  My wife has an i-phone (8 plus) and the contacts will not completely load.  Acura says it is and Apple software problem.  I can not comment on the cost of maintenance yet as I have not had anything done on it yet.  I have changed the oil because on a new engine I like to change the oil withing a few thousand miles to drain out the engine break-in byproducts.   Over all I am very happy with this car.  It is fun to drive and very comfortable.

acura,mdx,2018,Clare Conley, 04/16/2018,Nice Car-Could Be Better,pos,"We've had our 2018 MDX for about seven months, and have taken it on five road trips.  It replaced a 2010 RL, which in turn replaced a 2005 RL.  We like practically everything about the car except the adaptive cruise control (which picks up large trucks in the lane immediately to our right), the dimmed rear view mirror, and-significant blind spots only partly mitigated by the blind spot monitoring system. However, the big turn-off is the navigation system's traffic information.  Both the 2005 and 2010 RLs had the identical system, backed by XM radio based traffic info.  The MDX traffic is HD radio-based, and at least in Arizona, California, and Oregon, is spotty-some places it works some days.  Other days, it doesn't work in the same places.  Why, oh why, did they replace a functioning delivery system with a defective one?
"
acura,mdx,2018,James Peebles, 01/23/2019,Nine different electrical failures in twenty seven,neg,"I've been robbed. Nine different electrical failures in twenty seven weeks.  That's every three weeks there is a new problem. Most concerning is heated seat problem, possibly a fire hazard. Six failures have occurred one time, three problems are intermittent. Dealership can't emulate failures and will not change any components in an attempt to eliminate a possible cause. I am working with a regional case manager with Acura client relations now. Many other MDX models are having the same problems. If you are having a problem with your MDX, file a report with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . I think all of us should gather in some group and file a  class action lawsuit. Acura knows about these problems and continues to sell their defective product.

acura,mdx,2018,Lynne, 02/18/2018,Acura MDX 2018,pos,"Apple iphone does not work. Downloaded the phone contact list multiple times and after contacting the dealer 8 was told that the latest IOS upgrade is not supported by the car. Ha e to wait for another upgrade and hope it works.

acura,mdx,2018,Chris Yoso, 06/05/2018,One Of The Best Midsize Luxury SUV’s,pos,"After owning an unreliable Gl550 resulting in over 5,000 dollars for repair, I decided our family should switch to something more reliable. While the Lexus RX was a solid choice it was slow and the lower trim levels was not really nice. I heard about Acura and thought I should check it out. Overall I am glad with my choice not only because of the lower price, but because of the reliability. This car feels upscale, not cheap. The only downside was the Acura dealers. The service is not very good.  "
acura,mdx,2018,Jennifer, 09/02/2018,Slow to leave 1st gear,neu,"Love the car but leaving from a stop its slow to go. Jerks coming out of first into second. Disappointing. Drove another mdx and it was ok so the problem is with mine. Dealership said it seemed fine but its not.
"
acura,mdx,2018,Shakor, 01/13/2019,Overpriced! Overrated!,neu,"Rear differential fluid must be changed every 7k miles! It used to be every 70k miles! This will run you about $300 at the dealer who is the only one recommended to do it. Premium gas is recommended. The car is sluggish with economy gas. I use plus gas. The car does jerk a little in the lower gears when pressing on the gas but could be due to gas quality. There tends to be some dust when I turn on the fan. Passengers will usually cough or sniffle when the air is on. The air quality and airflow is bad even with a new filter. The front seats are heated, the rear seats are not heated. It would be nice if all seats are heated. Headlights are nice and bright and have a cool design. The armrest on the door is a little hard. It should be made more comfortable. This SUV is overpriced in my opinion at 50K. Safety radar / collision detection feature to warn when approaching a vehicle too fast in front of me is very useful! Rear seats are not comfortable and padding is thin.

acura,mdx,2018,Brian, 08/10/2018,2018 MDX Advance is Awesome,pos,"Solid car! I don’t understand other reviews here. Great acceleration with smart instruments and powerful semi-autonomous driving! Lane Keeling assist kept me equidistant and worked like a charm. Let’s me know- as an older driver I am- if I happen to drift and corrects it for me. Many features and so fun to learn- my dealer has a class once a month so if you want to learn more about all the features you can without having to just poke around- and they feed you free with the great Acura Service bar- sandwiches and drinks served free! Try getting that from another Manufacturer- I can pre order my lunch by my phone and if I get my oil changed- just eat in their awesome lounge while the oil is changed Free! Yes- first 10 oil changes / tire rotations included! Best looking SUV ! Mine is black on black- our one kid loves the captain chair and she has her own console- No mini van needed! Can’t imagine anything better-

acura,mdx,2018,John C, 01/01/2019,Sluggish and Noisy,neg,"Car is slow and jerky in accelerating from 1st to 2nd gear. Is also extremely noisy at highway speed in above normal windy conditions. A clanking sound from underneath engine is quite common. Dealers reinforced sound deadening strips around doors and windows but noise can still be heard. Would not recommend this car.
"
acura,mdx,2018,Cal, 09/04/2018,Great value and style!,pos,"I compared the MDX with the Lexus R350L, Audi Q7 and Infinity QX60 and purchased this car because of the value, comfort and style.  I have been very pleased with the performance thus far."
acura,mdx,2018,Jim Smith, 05/05/2019,Great driving 4400lb Hybrid SUV,pos,"Ride and handling excellent.  Acceleration with assist of those 2 rear electric motors is awesome for this fuel efficient 4400lb SUV.  Average fuel economy is 25 to 30 MPG, but supreme gasoline is required.  Handling in hard driving rain is excellent.  Nighttime drive is excellent and on the winding 2 lane back roads exceptional with great stability and Auto dimming very bright headlights.  Yes, the transition from a stop while on battery to engine power takes bit to get use to, but is really not bad at all.  I find the controls are very easy to use and did not take much time to get use to using each.  I use Android Auto running Waze or Google Maps for navigation and could not ask for better performance.  Front climate controlled seating is awesome, 2nd row captain seats are great, while 3rd row seating is tight and be used for smaller kids or short trips for taller people.  Cargo capacity is good for me.  No towing with this Hybrid could be a problem for some.  I've driven this SUV for just about a year without issue and performance and ride for me has been exceptional both in city and on the highway.  Just about at the 2 year point and this SUV for me has been perfect.  No problems at all.  Ride and drive perfect.

acura,mdx,2018,MDX Owner 15 Years , 02/07/2020,Transmission Problems!!,neg,"I’ve had my 2018 MDX for two years.  At 17k miles I had to have my transmission replaced and serviced after at least 3 additional times to “reset” my transmission because of jerking and the influx from shifting from one gear while driving, mind you while during automatic mode.  My rear camera has been stuck on at least 6 times while driving, error messages but no light warning and getting stuck in Neutral while finishing my car wash.  In a panic about the person behind me about to smash into me because they are on the belt behind me.  Hitting the drive button, neutral button at least 16 times before having to placing my car in park while still on the belt.  Now I’m starting to hear the little humming noise again now at 25k miles, same sound I started to hear before my transmission went out the first time.  Love Acura but this might be my last rodeo depending on the out come with the dealer today.  Uhg!!

acura,mdx,2018,Matt, 05/09/2018,Beware - Fragile electronics,neg,"The rear USB ports are perilously close to the rear drinks holders and unprotected from even the slightest spill.  My young boy spilt no more than a straw full of liquid but it was enough to completely short the electronics and completely incapacitate the car and render it undriveable.  After a four figure repair sum Acura client relations were rude and completely unsympathetic.  Will be the last Acura I ever buy - sticking with Lexus from now on.  Shame because the car actually drives great, but doesn't have the attention to detail of other luxury brands.

acura,mdx,2018,Charlotte, 04/28/2018,LOVE my 2018 Acura MDX with Technology,pos,"Having owned Buick, Honda, Toyota, and Opel, I absolutely love my new MDX.   The technology portions have been greatly improved and are easier to use.  And, I really love CarPlay.  In selecting my new vehicle, I test drove the Highlander, RDX and the MDX.  My requirements were ride comfort and low vehicle noise.  I would rank my choices as follows:  MDX, Highlander (a close second) and the RDX which made more sense economically.  However, the MDX met my primary needs better than the other two.  Knowing Acura's reliability made my decision, and I have been driving it now for a month and love it.  FYI, my friends have been very impressed with the ride and the ease of using the technology.  They drive 2018 Ford, Lexus, Toyota, and Honda SUV's.
"
acura,mdx,2018,WallyO, 07/25/2018,This car is a steal at full sticker,pos,"This SUV offers a combination of high technology in the very smooth, full-time torque-vectoring hybrid system, precise and entertaining dynamics and a comfortable and very quiet cabin that is unlike any other car I've driven; and I've owned dozens, including a few BMW's, several MB's, and four Mini Coopers. The Hybrid semi-autonomous systems work incredibly well (including the Lane Keep Assist, which makes the car nearly self-driving, with no ping-ponging from side to side), and the versatility of operational customization through the settings menu is stellar.  The four-drive-mode setup is also excellent, essentially allowing you to own three very different cars that you can instantly call up, depending on your mood and purpose in the moment. (The difference between Comfort and Normal is subtle, but Sport and Sport+ transform the car.) I know that some people feel the interior design and materials fall below that of other ""luxury"" cars, but I find the cabin very well made, very useful and very attractive. Like most BMW's, the interior is solid and understated, and avoids the ostentatious bling-bling look that some now equate with luxury and ""prestige."" This is a luxury car, but without pretension. The lack of glitzy features (like the completely unnecessary gimmick of Google Earth in the NAV system) is a relief, and makes the car functionally safer because of the lack of distractions. (If you want to play video games, I'd suggest you stay at home. If you want to know where you're going, simple map graphics are required.) Operationally, the Hybrid is complex enough in operation and functional options, that a new owner should take some time familiarizing himself or herself while still in the garage. After a week or two, you'll realize that you have a stellar vehicle on your hands.

I must say I am at a loss with the Edmund's review which says the car feels lethargic around town.  The car was delivered with one of the folding mirrors not working properly but the dealer promptly fixed it but it should have been discovered pre-delivery.  The car has been recalled twice .  Overall the car is very complex and I have noticed some anomalies which quickly clear up.  Perhaps a dirty sensor or the extreme cold affects the systems for a few seconds.  We get over 26 mpg.  The car has the adaptive suspension which is fantastic.  Want the ride soft and cushy or firm and stable, just dial it up to your liking.  All in all we love the car and recommend it.

Update 4-18-2020
Over 15,000 trouble free miles  We continue to enjoy the MDX and all its features.  We have maintained a solid 26 mpg.  I have no complaints at this time.

acura,mdx,2018,T.J., 04/24/2019,Still some lingering issues not Acura Quality,neu,"Have had my 2018 MDX SH AWD with Technology  Package for over 2 1/2 years now. For the most  part it is a good vehicle, certainly not great. The Acura voice recognition system for virtually all applications is terrible. Pardon...Pardon...Pardon! It is past irritating. Acura has never found a fix.

Drivability is good but the transmission still surges at times when starting from a stop. Has be re-programed by the dealer with minimal changes. Vehicle developed a rattle in the rear interior area . Dealer took panels off and put  grease at every possible point that could rattle. Acura knew about the issue but has no permanent fix so the dealer did the best they could.
On a positive note the front seats are very comfortable.
In retrospect maybe I should have purchased the Honda Pilot. Believe it is a better value for the money.

acura,mdx,2018,Valerie, 08/07/2020,DANGER/Serious transmission problems,neg,"This car has a very serious problem of hesitating and when on a freeway changing lanes or getting onto a freeway it is very serious. It won't go when accelerating. It jerks from a stop all too often. Now I must take it into Acura because it isn't shifting into second gear going up our hill. Not a very big hill either. Too much transmission problems and this has been a problem with this car for years. I read since 2005. If it can't be fixed a redesign of the car is a necessity. TOO DANGEROUS.

acura,mdx,2018,Jmanuel, 10/02/2020,My mdx experience,pos,"I owned a 2018 Acura MDx tech package with brown leather seats ,in my experience driving this vehicle for the past 2 years the only thing that disappoints me is the way the transmission works , feels all the time jerky ,hesitation and since new the vehicle makes a clamping sound every time when goin in speeds and reverse other than that the mdx is confortable driving at high speeds and long trips. Mdx need a new interior change it got stuck back in the 2010 ‘s maybe a redesign and a new engine transmission will make it get 5 stars out of 5

acura,mdx,2018,Darren, 12/16/2020,Great SUV for the money,pos,"If you’re looking for a family-friendly 3-row SUV with strong performance and driving attributes along with some of the highest safety ratings look no further. Although a bit dated and light on luxurious interior the vehicle is packed with technology. The Acura MDX Sport Hybrid is agile and so fun to drive. Great prices abound for used 2018 and 2019 model years. I have owned a 2018 Sport Hybrid and have had zero issues with the vehicle after almost 3 years and 38k miles.

I am 5’2”  and even with the seat all the way up, I can’t see the end of the car.  We only got the technology package, so no help with parking.  I pray I don’t take out the wall of my garage or another car in a parking lot.

acura,mdx,2018,Louie lou, 02/24/2018,MDX pros and cons,pos,"Overall the vehicle is a pretty sound investment. The overall value is great compare to respected models in different makes . The acceration is poor at best. But that’s because you have to get use.  To using the hand throttle control in your fingers . Other then that the MDX technology package is a great value . Plus depending on how and what you did to accomplish buying your vehicle . My strategy was simple getting the most for the least possible cost . What other dealers in the market place were charging me plus tax . I ran a pretty hard bargain. In several dealerships . The comparison and competition was stiff . But you have to drive a hard barge all the way .

So I have to listen  this noise forever? They said sorry YES because  the manifactor doesn't  want to recall  
acura,mdx,2018,shortKarateGi, 04/20/2018,Must buy,pos,"If you’re in the market for an SUV, you have to consider the 2018 Acura MDX Sports Hybrid. This vehicle is not only fuel efficient, it is also a semi autonomous vehicle. With the combination of LKAS and Adoptive Cruise Control, it could almost drive itself. The infotainment is also good with Apple Carplay. The navigation is OK, I have yet to know how the traffic info can be accessed. For an average size and weight, this car is humongous, lots of space for the entire family. We were able to test the seating capacity, drove for about an hour and a half — no complaints; but I will not suggest it for a very long drive as the middle sit of the second row is quite uneasy to look at. Perhaps this can cary 6 adults and 2 kids? Acceleration is quite good for its size and the MPG was easily achieved, actually moe than the advertised combined MPG. We topped it with 28 and change — actual calculation at the fuel pump. Overall, it’s a verry good car to have. No complaints so far as the car is less than a month of ownership.

acura,mdx,2018,anthony martin, 12/30/2017,Great SUV short on seat height,pos,"If you are a short person the seat does not go up enough. RDX does not offer a lot of the comfort accessories like automatic tilt side mirrors, heated steering wheel, telescoping steering wheel.

I went to shop a certified MDX after selling my Honda CRV, and came out of the dealership leasing a brand new MDX sports hybrid. The looks and feel of the vehicle are very attractive. Fuel economy, handling , and acceleration is great. The sports+ mode gives you the sports car feel along with the paddle shifters. Kind of , severs the purpose of a SUV and a sports car. i want to buy this car after my lease ends, but am in a dilemma , since Acura is not a established name in hybrid motors, so not sure if the vehicle will be relaiable after few years.

I love the paddle shifters. I average 75000 miles before brake repair. My wish is that the Acura MDX had the cargo space of a Toyota Sienna but with all the great handling features, paddle shifters, amenities. The Acura MDX  all wheel drive is a wonderful handling SUV. I would buy it again. The dealers service dept., are wonderful. Great customer service.

acura,mdx,2019,Bob-o, 02/15/2019,Active Damper System is GREAT!,pos,"I have only had this vehicle for a couple of months now, so still getting used to the hybrid part of it.  Traded in my 2018 Acura RDX Advance because the ride was so non-luxury.  Drove a regular MDX and it rode much nicer, but the Hybrid with the Active Dampers is amazing!  (it is also now standard on the 2019 MDX advance non hybrid)  It rides so nice.  It is fast yet comfortable, and rides beautifully.  The switch from battery to gas is mostly seamless.  The 7 speed dual clutch is great, but at lower speeds tends to stumble like most dual clutch transmissions.  There could be less road noise (an Acura trait).  I love the infotainment system, and while it is dated, it has been in my last 3 cars and it works GREAT.  Of course that is if you take the time to learn it and speak to it correctly and clearly.  Love my MDX and may buy this one at the end of the lease!
"
acura,mdx,2019,Noelsup, 12/09/2018,Hybrid or Not,pos,When I saw the specs comparison of the Standard 2019 MDX w/ Tech and the Hybrid Tech model  my decision was clear . The hybrid adds up to 5 extra miles per gallon while providing 30 more horsepower. I said where do I sign . This is my first hybrid and I am still getting used to part of the engine turning off while in traffic or waiting for a signal light to change. It can become annoying but other than that the car rides great. One important point to note the Hybrid model you can not add a hitch or tow. also the  vehicle does not come with a spare or lug wrench or jack: instead comes with an inflator system . 
acura,mdx,2019,Terri T., 01/04/2019,Love it! Love it! Love it!,pos,"I have had just about every SUV on the market. I was going to get the Q7 this time but just cannot justify the price and my local dealers customer service is lacking. This time, we tested the RX350L,( we have loved our current RX350 but need something bigger for our 2nd vehicle) Infiniti QX60 and the MDX. Our sales person at Lexus told us to test drive the MDX (LOL!) we went across the street and it was love at first sight. We like all the features and tech, the sportiness of the exterior and the customer service was truly the best ever. For the first time, we actually enjoyed the process. Everyone was very professional, friendly and we didn't feel like we were being ""sold"". Shout out to Acura of Brookfield! I can't see us driving anything else.
"
acura,mdx,2019,Acura fan, 05/08/2019,A-Spec Spot On,pos,"This is my 5th Acura and second MDX.  For the money, I think Acura offers a better value in the luxury market, especially versus the German competition.  The latest A-Spec model features many sporty upgrades and looks hot to trot!  The lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control make this a driver-less car for all practical purposes.  The cruise is a bit slow to adapt especially when cars in front brake or speed up rapidly.  It’s hardly a significant concern, however.  The interior of the car is spacious and luxurious, the suede like leather is an eye catching upgrade.  The Krell sound system rocks on, especially with advanced engineered CD’s - remember them?  The Super Handling AWD is a must for every driving circumstance and performs especially well in higher speed cornering.  A dynamic control feature allows the drive to shift between 3 drive modes.  The Sport mode offers excellent acceleration, responsive steering and enhanced torque in the the S-AWD. The rear cargo space is spacious and fits all my baseball gear, lawn chairs, and coolers so my junk in the trunk has plenty of room to share the ride.  Getting into and out of the 3rd row seating was made easier but automatic seat control buttons accessible to both passengers in the rear 3rd row seats and from the second row.  The brake hold feature is a must have on every new car I’ll ever buy in the future.  It enables me to take my foot off the brake after a complete stop.  This saves the wear and tear on my leg.  Overall a 5 star car!"
acura,mdx,2019,David, 01/11/2019,Third MDX since 2014,pos,"Have now purchased our 3rd MDX since 2014.  Traded in our std 2014 MDX FWD Tech pkg on the new 2019. Had a 2016 SH-AWD Advance/Tech pkg and absolutely loved it but traded it for a Sierra Denali 4x4 truck only because I bought a big boat and needed something to tow it.  Looked at all comparable SUV’s in this class including Lexus, Benz, BMW and Audi.  We just keep coming back to the MDX.  Who cares about badging status on the hood?  Spending over $55K on a vehicle is a significant decision for anyone. The MDX is better at fuel economy, doesn’t break, handles great, has plenty of room, rich in features & feel with a great ride and handling.  We kept coming back to the 2019 MDX which we just bought after Christmas 2018.  Love the comfort and features of the second row buckets with very practical and usable center console.  We are  very pleased and experienced owners of Acura products.  My son also drives an Acura.  He has a TSX and it’s simply a lot of car for the money.  Again very low maintenance costs, no breakdowns, fantastic fuel economy with a pleasure to drive in town and highway feel.

acura,mdx,2019,Paul B., 12/21/2018,A+++ 2019 Acura MDX,pos,"I had an Acura MDX back in 2004 and never should have switched. After the Acura I went to a Mazda CX-9 which is a great vehicle in itself. So when I started to consider getting a new SUV I looked at a Mazda Signature, Lexus RX 350 L as well as Subura and Toyota Highlander. In the end once I drove the new MDX it was a no contest decision. From the safety features, the outstanding ride, quality and looks it was hands down MDX. I have had the vehicle for a month and like it more every time I drive it. I would recommend this vehicle to those who want safety, comfort and looks with extreme elegance as well. Acura has a hit and delivers on this one!
"
acura,mdx,2019,Allday, 06/20/2019,The best 3 Row SUV for someone looking for luxury,pos,"I’ve been looking at all the 3 Row SUVs and been a Lexus fan for years. But when the RXL didn’t have any room in the 3rd row, we looked elsewhere. I was glad to come across Acura MDX and was blown away by what you get with the price point. There lease programs can’t be beat so we pulled the trigger. The infotainment is dated but I use apple car play so it wasn’t a deal breaker. But everything else about the car and ride is better than the RX. I only wish they had a full glass roof.
"
acura,mdx,2019,Jim R, 06/20/2019,Pleased with the decision on MDX,pos,"Overall the SH-AWD MDX is an impressive 7 passenger SUV. The engine is the long tried and trusted SOHC V6 that’s been around for a long time and proven itself. It’s poweband is well-mated to the ZF 9-speed’s ratios. The engine is smooth through the rev range but really comes on at and above 4000. It also emits a pretty refined but aggressive snarl, backing up the performance image Acura is hoping to convey. The ride is composed yet slanted towards comfort and not so much hard core performance. The ride is unquestionably supple and very little road noise enters the cabin. By far the most impressive attribute of the MDX is its fit and finish. Equal to any European luxury SUV we’ve owned or test driven. My one wish would be to somehow better the real, day-to-day fuel efficiency. This MDX replaced an Audi Q5 TDI, which returned an average of 30+ mpg, combined (along with jet-like acceleration) and it cannot come close to the Audi’s MPG (yes not fair to compare a gasoline and diesel vehicle, I know). All told, my wife and I are very fond of our MDX.

acura,mdx,2019,ACURA FAN, 02/21/2019,ACURA FAN,pos,"Very nice suv reliable and very good mpg for a big car. the technology on the car is outdated for example, the navi, and the dash board. There is no wireless charger even know i have a 2019 advance. Also the entertainment is not blue ray like the one on the pilot or the Honda van.  but overall is a very good suv, i like how it drives and also how it looks. The most important thing is that you don't spend to much money on services or repairs like on the mercedes benz or bmw.

acura,mdx,2019,Ralph, 05/14/2019,"Transmission struggles , navigation graphics poor",pos,"The navigation is poor.  specially the graphics which are useless in a city with  detail.  Also verbal commands are slow and often non responsive.

acura,mdx,2019,Malia B, 02/15/2019,Very disappointed,neg,"My husband and I recently bought this car because we have a little one on the way and we’ve been frustrated and disappointed ever since. The car drives fine- very smooth and nice acceleration- but the rest of it is just NOT user friendly at all. I don’t know how the entertainment system was even allowed to be designed the way it is. The buttons on the screen are tiny. It’s so challenging to navigate when it should be straightforward. It’s even hard to change things like volume and air conditioner speed- things you don’t want to be worrying about while driving. My phone will connect to Bluetooth but not import my phone book for voice activation, which is the main point. Apparently this has been an ongoing issue for others as well, so be aware if you’re thinking about buying this car. I’ve tried contacting Acura support for help multiple times and each time I have to hang up after being on hold for thirty minutes. So, service is apparently terrible as well. For as much money as we spent on this “luxury” brand, I would expect so much more!!!

acura,mdx,2019,jeff Spencer, 09/05/2019,Acura Convert,pos,"I have been a Lexus owner for many years and recently traded a Honda Pilot in on a 2019 ES 350.  Big mistake, don’t get me wrong the car is awesome but I immediately realized that I made a mistake.  The car is almost impossible to get out of and after 3 weeks of ownership I couldn’t take the pain from the seats(very hard) so I parked it while deciding what to do.  MDX to the rescue.  From the moment I stepped into the SUV for a test drive it took about 10 minutes and I knew that it was the right fit.  We worked out a generous trade and an hour later I was on my way.  Everything about this vehicle is first class. I can’t believe how happy I am with the vehicle.  Try it you’ll love it.

acura,mdx,2019,S. Smith, 03/29/2019,Very disappointed,neu,"I traded the 2018 RDX for the 2019 MDX. WTH is wrong with Acura putting the temperature control on the awful screen?? Changing/adjusting the temperature is enough to cause an aneurism. Are you supposed to pull over everytime you need to adjust it?? This is a huge safety issue and utterly stupid. The 9 speed transmission is not great, and while it's not as loud as the RDX, it's still very loud on the interior.  The GPS is still garbage,  please see Verizon's navigation app for some 21st century ideas, your GPS is still trash. Last Acura for me.

The turbo charged 4 cylinder engines seem great, but I don't think there is enough data to prove their long term benefits. I drive my cars into the ground, so I want a car that will last for at least 10 years. The MDX has everything I want. The 50/50 split 3rd row seat allows for a comfortable seat while also providing ample cargo space. I have owned my MDX for about 6 weeks and couldn't be happier.

Just finished an 800 mile road trip and at the end of the drive, we didn’t feel like we have been on a long trip. The ride was so nice, comfortable and quiet...it’s like the car drives you. 

We looked at all the major players, and for the price we were able to get it for, it was an easy decision. Our first Acura and our first “luxury” car and couldn’t be happier. Buy an MDX for less than a highlander, um yes please. 

The MDX handles like a car, fun to drive if you want it to be, but plush and comfy as well. All this with a 3rd row for our 2 kiddos and stuff. 

Highly recommended the MDX.

Plenty of room, all the bells and whistles I need (Apple Car Play, Power folding mirrors, remote start, SH-AWD, ELS Stereo, heated seats, Siri Eyes Free, AcuraLink, Nav, etc.). The transmission is butter  smooth. My MDX has been on 3 road trips so far and it is super comfortable to drive long distances. I feel very safe especially knowing I have the SH-AWD system. The ride quality is very smooth. Plenty of cargo room (I keep the 3rd row down). I do not regret for one second leasing this vehicle even though a redesign is right around the corner. I got a great deal and know the vehicle has had several improvements to keep it amazing. Well done Acura! 
"
acura,mdx,2019,Andy, 07/15/2020,"Great value, love almost everything",pos,"For the money, this can’t be beat. Got a FWD Tech for nearly $10k off sticker. That’s Honda Toyota Hyundai Kia money for a luxury brand. Inner snob is satisfied. 

The only bad is the transmission. It’s not awful, but sometimes in the 40-50 range it just can’t decide what gear to take and it’s sometimes awkward and jerky. Solution - cruise control only at higher speeds. 
Also wish I’d sprung for the advance pkg in order to Get cooled seats and heated steering wheel. Features our old Kia minivan had. But power memory steering wheel is a real plus. 

More good:
Infotainment. It gets a bad rap, but with Apple CarPlay on top, you’ll never need the janky outdated factory Navi (except as a backup when there’s no cell signal), and the bottom screen shows the audio. Easy peasy. It’s auto climate control and the temp +\- toggle switches are great. 
Sound system is pretty good too. 

The transmission- in the mountains in sport mode, it was telepathic. Held lower gears both up and downhill, I didn’t have to ride the brakes. Played with the paddles some but it wasn’t even necessary. Was SO FUN in the twisties, felt like my good old Accord but bigger and more powerful. Such a blast on our summer vacation in Colorado. 

Fuel economy - not bad, 19ish avg mixed, 25 over a long hot fast 2100 mile road trip. Had I stayed in the 70s mph, would have been high 20s mpg, but I was making good time with cruise at 88 (in a 75 zone). 

Great cruiser, could be a bit quieter but the comfort and handling are very good.

acura,mdx,2020,Steve C., 09/15/2019,Previous European car owner,pos,"I've been doing a lot of research in the last few weeks on which SUV would be right for me.  My past vehicles have been Saab, Mercedes, Audi, Volvo and Porsche. I've only owned 2 Japanese cars Honda & Subaru. I have to say all the European models were spot on as far as appearance and performance but one thing for sure expensive to own if your warranty runs out. Any repairs or service for these cars can be a huge expense (Porsche oil change $275). I normally buy my cars outright and keep them for at least 8 yrs so I asked my mechanic what he thought.  He told me he's been in the auto repair business for 28 yrs and while some  Euro cars are beautiful looking  as far as reliability, dependability and cost efficient you cannot beat Japanese cars.  After checking out Lexus, Infinity and Volvo I decided to give the MDX a test drive and was very much impressed for how much value you receive at around $10,000-$15,000 less than most European models. I've only had this car for a few weeks and I can say so far I love this car.  It's spacious, looks great, handles excellently for an SUV, has many standard safety features, and has a very smooth ride. After reading some reviews on this car I was a bit hesitant about remarks on the info system being non intuitive but it really wasn't that bad at all it's amazing all the features this car has. I drive to Florida once a year and like to take a lot of road trips and now I feel confident that I can do so with worrying about high maintenance cost or finding the right facility that can service my vehicles. All in all I am very please with my purchase.  I will give another update in a few months..

acura,mdx,2020,Mike in Katy. Texas , 09/30/2019,The MDX offers the most bang for your $,pos,"Update to the review. I’ve now had the MDX for a year and it continues to exceed my expectations. Due to Covid, I haven’t put as many miles on it as would have been, but it was still over 10,000 miles. It drives great and came in handy when taking hurricane relief supplies to my family 500 miles away in Alabama. With all seats folded, I was able to take a generator and a week’s worth of supplies, so it’s size really came in handy. 

Overall I continue to be extremely pleased with the MDX. 

I’ve owned a 2002 MDX, three Honda Pilots (2006, 2013, 2017) and they’re great SUVs. I traded my 2017 Pilot for a 2020 MDX, FWD w Technology package. The MDX is amazing. It looks fantastic and drives even better. It’s a great mix of sporty, with excellent comfort. The two screen infotainment system gets a lot of bad press, but I like it a lot. It allows me to have Apple Car Play with maps on the top screen, while showing which song I have playing on the lower screen. The single touch screen in the Pilot was excellent, but often switched to the next song, requiring me to move it back to maps on a longer trip. The dual screen MDX doesn’t require that. 

The MDX drives like a dream. It’s powerful and smooth. The nine speed ZF transmission has been hammered, but it seems quite smooth to me. The sport mode is especially fun, as it tightens down the steering and makes me forget I’m driving an SUV. 

The ELS stereo is outstanding, and as quiet as the MDX is, it allows the ELS to really shine. While I had to upgrade my Pilot with aftermarket speakers, the MDX Tech package removes  the need for that. 

The seats are amazingly comfortable and the 14 way adjustable seats makes it feel like you’re sitting in a lounge chair. 

Overall, the MDX offers the most bang for the buck in the crowded luxury SUV space.  
"
acura,mdx,2020,SL2C, 12/14/2019,Sensible Review and Impressions MDX 2020,pos,"I decided to write a review to help those who are on lookout for their luxury SUV buying adventure.

There are a tons of choices and all are good and since no size fits all, MDX may not be a right choice for you. I will give you my experience of buying and features that we use all the time.

First of all this is a solid car which we hope to own for a long time. Everything in car is high end and not overly show off. I read a lot about two screens and I actually love it. It is a brilliant implementation. It takes some time to learn but if you are middle of the road tech person you will learn it fast.

First screen on the top and deep  inside the dashboard is for inbuilt navigation and apple play and Android auto. It is non touch screen for a reason because you can't touch it. But since it is dedicated to a particular function it remains that way all through the trip. Other screen is dedicated to normal functioning of controls and buttons below that screen control Navigation and Apple Play screen. Don't fret too much about it you will learn fast and will realize how splendid two screen idea is.

Now, lane assist and adaptive cruise are the two most used functions and they work perfectly on high way but sporadically on inner roads. Which is not a big deal as you should be in charge of driving while in your neighborhood.

The biggest upside of having advance model is 360 view camera. It is brilliant if you want to know how far are you from car parked next to you or how far the right side curb is while parallel parking. Having back seats heated are important if you will be driving kids around. And heated steering wheel is great during cold weather.

Pricing wise we found out the best discount you can get is in $7000 to $7500 range off of msrp. So let your dealer price it up. Go back home and counter with $7500 below. Most likely dealer will accept. You can go on TrueCar and randomly select dealers nearby and request pricing pick the best price and ask your dealer to match. From our experience best price was $7,500 below MSRP.

Before you decide to buy sit down with finance person and ask what additional warranties or treatments are available. There are a lot and for us making decision on the same day while picking up the car was hard. We suggested our dealer to improve on that. But there are some good ones and it makes sense to get those.

Extended warranty is expensive at $4000+ but it virtually covers everything non wear tear up to 125,000 miles. If you are going to keep car for that long and afraid if technology inside the car will fail then it buys you a piece of mind. Having window treatment and outer body treatment is another great option that covers from spills inside and dents outside. And it is lifelong.

Accessories are another area where there are some great choices. Having a tow hitch and splash guards with all weather mats in my opinion is a must for this car. In a high traffic area use tow hitch to install rear collision protection guard and you don't have to worry about someone rear ending your car. Splash guard protects sides of your car from mud splashing.

Whether you buy tech package or advance both are great and not having overly jazzy but a solid family luxury car is what you need and you are a buy and hold kind of family then this is a car for you.

Happy hunting."
acura,mdx,2020,Deb , 01/09/2020,Super Impressed!,pos,"It took me a year to finally buy an Acura MDX- wanted one for a long time, but I am one that probably researches way too much and I kept seeing 2 main complaints... the 9 speed transmission and the infotainment!

So far I am loving the MDX it’s super smooth! Whatever refinements have been made have seemed to work so far and I really like the 2 screen infotainment! I bought the advance AWD with Entertainment and I’m super happy- at this point... I’m still holding my breath a little hoping that I don’t have trouble with shifting, but so far it’s so smooth.

The last 3 cars I’ve bought have been the last year right before a new model change and it’s worked for me... all the kinks seem to have been ironed out.

I have no trouble with the touch screen AC controls ect and I pretty much do everything other than AC from the steering wheel... the main reason I went with Advance was the leather seats they are so soft and worth it to me to pay the extra for comfort! 

I’ve had a Lexus RX 350 and it was not near as comfortable and roomy as the MDX... buying car is such a personal decision I just hope this helps someone who may be struggling as well...

No need to buy other brands for everything you get with Acura and very reliable. No issues

acura,mdx,2020,Hoyden, 01/12/2020,Worthwhile upgrade from Pilot.,pos,"Quiet, competent, quality.  All of the Honda build quality and engine excellence with more sound dampening insulation and better ride than the excellent Pilot.  I like the two level screens, keeps your radio info showing on the lower screen while your phone call goes onto the upper screen. Plenty of power, never gets loud, even under full throttle acceleration.  2nd gear off the line system is smooth and quiet. I waxed the car, the paint is flawless across the body, no divots, no rough spots. Quiet sunroof at speed with the optional air deflector. I would like a roll shade over the back deck as I never use the 3rd row seats. I liked it better than the Volvo XC-90 for much less $$.

acura,mdx,2020,Muhammad Fiaz, 12/09/2019,Acura MDX high Tech well built reliable,pos,"reliable fun to drive comfortable SUV far better then any other SUVs 
I can’t understand what’s so difficult about having two screens one upper screen for apple car play and driving info And bottom screen for radio cd etc its very well planned and nothing confusing about it .
I am driving MDX since 2010 now I upgraded to 2020 MDX
I got excellent deal and a decent trade in price for my old MDX .
Plus no extra charge for awesome HONDA SENSING features a must have which other charge thousands of dollars for these features
Will recommend AWD, drive and handling is cool AND less drag on your body when you drive long distance in AWD

acura,mdx,2020,John, 03/21/2020,MDX Sport Hybrid Advanced,pos,"Spent months looking around at different cars (Mercedes, Audi, Subaru, Toyota) and ultimately decided I wanted the Sport Hybrid with Advance package.  I found a new 2019 with the Canyon Bronze that I wanted about 100 miles from my house so got a great deal on a new car.  With Acura's incredible warranty on certified I would have been just as happy with a certified used with low miles..  I had some reticence based on what I had read about the infotainment and the quality of the materials on the interior.  My wife has a 2017 Honda Pilot Elite with the 9 speed transmission and will admit that I don't love it.  But the Sport Hybrid doesn't share the same transmission.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase.  The car has great acceleration, very smooth, the infotainment system is perfectly fine and it is nice to have Apple Car Play/Nav/Camera in one screen and the Stereo on another.  The safety features (lane keep, brake hold, adaptive cruise, etc.) are a great feature and are standard on all MDXs.  You pay a lot extra on other vehicles for those features and once you have them you realize how great they are.  Very pleased with the quality of the interior, too.

Things I don't love are that that the controls for the seat heater/cooler aren't terribly easy to use, but if you put it on auto I have found it is not an issue and I don't have to use the controls very often.  I wish it had a digital speedometer like our Pilot and our Mercedes.  You get used to having one so it is a bit of an adjustment when you switch to pure analog.  I don't love the push button gear shifter.  I think with time I will get used to it and it will not be an issue at all.  The Pilot has it and my wife said she got used to it.  

Overall, exceptionally happy with the vehicle and highly recommend.  I have only had it for a few weeks so if my feelings change I will repost.

acura,mdx,2020,Harlan, 04/22/2020,"Austin, TX MDX",pos,"The MDX has all I need for the region I live in, there is not the luxury items of other vehicles in it's class but it's affordable and meet's my family needs. Ride is comfortable and the vehicles ergonomic are suitable for my size.
Only negative I've seen is the well reported delay in cruise control response, reference the time it takes the vehicle to move into a new speed when the cruise control is already engaged. 
this is my second MDX and I love the larger storage book in the tail area just not sure how easy it will be to remove it I suffer a flat on the road.

"
acura,mdx,2020,VINNYNY, 09/26/2020,Best Value & Performance with a Side of Utility!,pos,"My last three SUVs were a Mercedes Benz, a BMW, and a Honda Pilot EX-L. I bought the Pilot because I wanted a vehicle that could haul my family of four, a couple of my kids' friends and all of our gear to the beach, amusement park, or on weekend getaways. The Pilot had the ""Utility"" part of SUV wired, but it totally lacked in the ""Sport"" department. My MB and BMW had the opposite problem.  The MDX SH-AWD delivers on both counts. Although it handles much better than the Pilot, it hauls almost as much. Acura should call it an ""FUV"" for Fun Utility Vehicle.

The reviews here bash the dual screens as archaic, but I love them. I can see my navigation and entertainment on separate screens without scrolling through the pages of a single large display. I never have to switch away from the nav screen to find a new radio station, change the source, or dial a call. Speaking of navigation, I purposely bought a base model because I'm not a fan of Honda/Acura's navigation systems. We have owned eight Honda/Acuras with navigation systems in the last 20 years and the nav system has always been the worst part of the car. With the MDX, I use Android Auto running Google Maps or Waze--much better than the OEM Garmin units!

Maybe the ""V"" should stand for value. I paid less than $35K for my MDX (plus TTL)--that's $20K less than I paid for my MB, $10K less than my BMW, and $5K less than the Pilot! The MDX is so inexpensive right now, that I'm thinking about buying a second one for my wife. Love it!

acura,mdx,2020,Molly Spence, 12/12/2020,I went back.,pos,"I had a 2008 MDX for many years and loved it. In 2018 I decided to shop around and chose, just for fun, the Volvo XC60 - I liked the sporty look and the wood-trimmed interior. But in driving it the first week, my whole family was annoyed by the engine noise level on the highway, the rigid back seats, the handling in snow, cumbersome tech and more. So about a year later, I decided on a lark to test drive an MDX again. It felt like returning to an old boyfriend who was so warm and strong, so good at hugs, tough and adventurous and capable to make me feel taken care of, but also, you know, a man who likes luxury and cleans up nice. He’s not the first one you notice — but why had I left this man?
 That day I ended my Volvo fling and brought home MDX. The whole family was so relieved and happy.

It has apple CarPlay, but why even try to use it when you can’t toucj the screen and have to use a nonsensical dial that doesn’t give you the full features and accessibility! The cabin could be likened to a recycling plant. Do not believe what the dealers say! This is a car stuck in the 20th century. Buyers beware.  
"
acura,mdx,2020,Informed consumer, 06/06/2020,Nice but not overly luxurious. Decent gas mileage.,pos,"The MDX will be upgraded in 2021. Styling is dated but still appealing. Navigation screen is much smaller than other cars in the class but I’m sure that will change in 2021. Power, performance and handling are good. Comfort is also      Very good. The start stop feature on this and all other makes of vehicles needs to go away! It interferes with climate control comfort and will be a maintenance issue down the road. The gas savings is minimal and doesn’t justify the inconvenience. There must be a better way! Overall the Acura MDX is a quality vehicle.

Acura has no fix.  The ac is not near as cold as my old Murano or Toyota’s and just adjusting the heat and ac on the screen is bizarre  reds normal heat and ac buttons/controls. Other than that car rides nice but will not be keeping after lease is up. I’m just crap out of luck w this one.

The Acura is a nice car with a lot of amenities for a base model.  The only thing the base model was lacking was the navigation, but I use my navigation through my smart phone, and I think I like it better that way.  Other than that I am happy with my choice.

Then we saw and fell in love with the PMC Edition.  I know it's really only 9 layers of paint, blacked out trim and a badge, but it's freaking awesome to be 1 of 330 in North America!
It's powerful, smooth to drive, handles really well, and has really great cargo storage.  Our third row is always down.
Definitely recommend the MDX.

acura,mdx,2020,G. Colton , Atlanta,Too Much Tech,pos,"This past May we purchased a brand new 2020 Acura MDX complete with the technology package. I had been driving an MDX for the previous nine years and was extremely fond of that car. The new model has, in my opinion, too much tech. For example, there is no stick shift anywhere in the vehicle. The transmission is all electric push button. It takes a while just to get the hang of it.  The car has an assortment of safety beeps and dings and flashing lights that alert you to potential roadside hazards. The problem with these is, they trigger frequently during what I shall call normal driving.
The owners instruction manual, while the thickness of a small library book, has so much information about so many things, and you have to read the fine print just to figure out how to work the radio. I guess you could say I have become used to the old way and now find myself slightly lost. Thank you"

I have not spent a cent on the car except for normal maintenance and an upgrade to a Comptec exhaust system. I didn't notice a change in performance, just a better exhaust sound. I just had an oil change and the tech said I still had 60% left on the brakes. There are no squeaks or rattles and everything works perfectly. I will need to replace the tires soon. The short throw shifter and 6 speed are a pleasure to drive. A tip of the hat to Acura and this car. It's no wonder that used NSXes hold their value.  "

The torque advantage of the Vette is 
obvious, but the 0-60 times are not

surprised that this ""merely 290HP"" NSX 
can outrun most stock sports cars that 
has more much more HP on the drag strip 
as well as on the track. The engine has 
the 2nd best soundtrack of any sports 
car (I rank Ferraris on the top of my 
list). Words aren't enough to describe 
the feeling this car gives to the 
driver or even the passenger. You MUST 
drive this car for yourself to realize 
it's worth every penny."
acura,nsx,2002,NSX Owner, 10/16/2002,Former Corvette owner,pos,"Advantage of driving a corvette:
It goes fast

Advantage of driving an NSX:
Luxury
Style
Handling
It turns heads
feels solid at ANY speed
a real gearbox
STREETABLE TORQUE! (ever heard of TOO 
MUCH TORQUE? The Corvette was 
rediculous - had to start it like a 
grandma or risk standing still in a 
burnout)
havent had a single reliability issue 
with it in 23,000 miles."
acura,nsx,2002,Bjorn, 11/24/2002,The ultimate Driving Machine !!!,pos,"What can I say, it my NSX has treated 
me very well.  It is fun, reliable and 
stands out in the crowd.  Move over 
BMW, the NSX is the ultimate driving 
machine !!!"
acura,nsx,2002,jmlnsx, 11/30/2002,Let's Get Real!!!,pos,"I had a 1991 NSX.I drove a new NSX and 
other then some cosmetics, it is the 
same car. ACURA dropped the ball! There 
needs to be a serious motor under the 
hood and all the nice things included 
for a price that should be about 
$30,000. lower then where the present 
model is priced. ACURA has always been 
know for it's great cars at reasonable 
prices. The NSX over the years has 
become way too expensive for what it 
has to offer.
Bring on the new car at $60,000. like 
when it first came out 11 years ago and 
ACURA will sell them like Corvettes."
acura,nsx,2002,mostafa nosrati, 08/16/2006,Best Honda/Acura Yet!!,pos,"very fun vehicle, would definetly buy another, looking forward to the new model comming out in late 2008, a fast vehicle, fun, quick, very responcive, and threlling. "

acura,nsx,2002,corvette z06, 05/02/2002,"Ha ha, funny.",pos,"Obviously people who want this car 
want to go fast. Why blow 90K on a V6 
3.2L? For better performance, save 40K 
and get a Corvette Z06. It's faster, 
made in America, and has a HUGE engine 
advantage over the NSX. Or if you are 
Corvette alergic, get a Dodge Viper. 
Way better and still saves you 20K."
acura,nsx,2002,laseca, 05/18/2002,This NSX is awesome compared to Z06,pos,"I've driven a ZO6 for a few days before 
buying the NSX.  Here's a comparison:

The Z06's steering is too light No feel. 
Shifting is truck-like. Body rigidity is worse 
than my 11 year old Honda. Ergonomics are 
pathetic. Controls vintage 1970. Build quality 
poor. Wavy panels, uneven gaps. 
Acceleration and braking are much better 
than the NSX.  Handling is about equal.

The Z06 feels half sports car and half truck. 
The shift feel is horribly coarse. This car feels 
like an old rattly crapbox with a big engine 
stuffed into it. There is none of the hi-tech 
feel one gets from most modern cars. Sure it 
costs less than a new NSX but I don't see 
the attraction at all.  You get what you pay 
for."
acura,nsx,2002,Dyno Dave, 12/02/2005,Excellent Overall Sports Car,pos,"Great Looks, Great Performance, Fantastic Reliability, I've had this car over 3 years and other than normal maintenance, not a cent of repairs. No squeaks or rattles. This car gets looks from everyone. Bumper to bumper traffic, mountain roads or high speed runs. Just a blast to drive. "
acura,nsx,2002,kiwi, 05/08/2002,A fine instrument,pos,"I'll take hand-crafted aluminum over 
American plastic any day. As far as 
performance, too many muscle-heads are 
fixated on size. If you want cubes, get 
yourself a Caddy with an 8-liter V8. 
The NSX is a scalpel and the Corvette 
is an axe. To join the legions of macho 
men that have the world looking at your 
tail lights, buy the Vette. If you want 
every twist and turn in the road to be 
brought to life under your steering 
wheel and don't have the money for a 
Ferrarri, the NSX is for you."

horsepower and great performance."
acura,nsx,2003,NSXterblue, 02/08/2003,EXOTIC to say the least,pos,"Having recently purchased an NSX, i 
have to say that this car is very 
specific. what i mean is that its not 
for everyone. It has the look of a 
ferrari or lambro, and a similar 
price,however it doesnt have the 
performance of them. Its close though. 
This car isnt one you should get if 
your looking for pure performance. You 
should get this if your looking for 
Exotic with Performance. THis car is 
more exotic than Ferrari's and 
Lamborginis, its great with the new 
interiors and 13 seconds is more than 
enough for me"

built for me.  It is the most 
comfortable,responsive, and powerful 
car I have ever owned. The ergonomics 
are excellent and the controls are 
intuitive and accessible.  The 6-speed

excellent, and driving topless is the

supercar standards I was expecting. 
Only 290hp. That is apparently the 
Lowest hp for dollar ratio. I think I 
was ripped off power wise.
And its interior looks too blah. Not 
chep feeling exactly, but looks pulled 
from any acura, and if it Was a parts-
bin car, it should have been cheaper."

opinions on the nsx without really 
giving full thought to the positives. 
It is true that the engine is outdated 
however the overall build of this car 
is unmatched. Extremely reliable and 
well-made. Handles like a dream and has 
the power where needed. Great weight 
balance, handling, and acceleration. 
Although the engine might be too ""weak"" 
for some, it still is quite capable of 
embarassing even current sports cars, 
despite its engine being 12+ yrs old."

The 2004 is amazing.  I have the yellow/yellow.  The paint on this car is flawless.  Just an amazing car in so many ways.  Love the fact that not many people ""get"" what this car is all about. It's not about power, it;s about balance. You have to own one to understand. I have owned many cars, but nothing compares to the NSX, and I will have it for years to come."

flawless.  I've 
had several Legends in the past and the 
NSX carries on that tradition.  I now have 
3000 miles on the car and it only gets better.  
It is definitely faster than when I first received 
it.  It is the easiest manual transmission I've 
ever driven--ratios are perfect, gates easy to 
hit, throw is short and silky, unfortunately, my 
wife loves it.  The brakes are strong.  The 
acceleration is very good, but my son says 
the Z-06 he has driven is much faster.  The 
handling is superb though, and the steering 
is very precise.  The fit and finish is better 
than my wife's Lexus and the paint is 
unbelievable."

acura,nsx,2005,Shawn So. Cal, 11/04/2008,Absolute Dream,pos,"I've had this car for almost 1 year.  The drive is superb, tight, quick, and responsive.  The style and attention to detail of the body hasn't been matched. Everywhere you go, people comment.  One catch, it is mainly guys that comment, women have no clue what they are seeing, so if your goal is to attract women, buy a Ferrari or a Porsche. The women that do notice tend to know a lot about the history of the car and what it is.  The look and feel of the drive is awesome.  Recently drove an M6 with over 500hp and love the NSX even more. You feel like you are one with the road.  The NSX is an extension of you and your skills.  Anyone considering this car drive the others first, and you will see"

I love this car for its beautiful, timeless style, reliablity, and of course it's exclusivity. I lived in NM 2+ years and have only seen 2 other NSXs. The view out the front window is the best in the business--- GT Prototype-like. The car is subtly fast-- 0-60 in 5.0 and 30-80 in a snap. The NSX has remarkable handling without too much drama. The car thinks along with you-- I guess that's what they mean when they say you become one with the car. This car looks as good standing still as it does flying by. The six speed transmission is Mazda Miata-like is quickness and short shifting distance."

other cars can boast higher horsepower 
and probably have a longer history or 
lineage, but in terms of something very 
unique which not many people know 
about, it has a character all in its 
own. There are no real words to 
describe it. It does no justice, but 
for the select few who get a chance to 
step in and drive one of these hand 
built exotics, it trully is an 
experience one should partake in."

The car is still 5.0 sec to 60 and handles incredibly well.  The NSX is very much improved from the 2002 model year forward.  There are very few automotive reviews on the post-2002 NSX which is a shame because the driving experience is much imporved over the older car."
acura,nsx,2005,Too Exotic, 02/25/2005,The real exotic car.,pos,"Big time head turner & get many thumbs up, Great PERFORMANCE, oustanding stylish look to it. Does not get blown away from any cars, as a matter of fact, it steals & attention from any car out there. Just way too hot.  When I pull up anywere, people have their jaws dropped onto the ground while staring at it. This car steals the show from M3 & any Porshce out there. You need a $250K Ferrari or $450k Carrera GT to compete with the NSX, not any upgraded volkswagen on steriods like the M3 & Porshce.  Can a Vette beat the NSX? OF course, but keep in mind, vette is only 1/2 the price of NSX. It really isn't a matter of affording any of the car, it is truely a matter of choice & taste!"
acura,nsx,2005,O.C. Dave, 09/17/2005,Great Car,pos,"The trill & performance of a Ferrari, with the reliability and low cost maintenance of an Acura. This is my 2nd. NSX and this has the best bang for the buck in the sports car market. I met a 1994 NSX owner whose car had over 200,000 miles on it. His only costs were for normal maintenance. I drove his 1994 and it was still tight and rattle free. People are always stopping me to ask questions or compliment on the car. "
acura,nsx,2005,kushbudz, 09/17/2005,An exotic without the price tag.,pos,No other car I have owned has attracted so much attention (it's almost a problem actually). The ride is exceptional and it corners like a bat outta hell. The interior is simple and free of the usual slew of buttons and oversized LCD screens. I much prefer this to the modern trend of bloating the car out with useless features  (it's a sports car not a cadillac). Add a supercharger and you will toast Ferrari's and Porsches that cost twice as much.
acura,nsx,2005,King Dudley, 11/16/2005,King Dudley's WHITE NSX,pos,"The automobile is SUPERB.  It is STILL what others are trying to evolve to.  The handling and performance is incredible for Acura.

After a year of the corvette, had to sell it and purchase another NSX. The NSX is agile, quick, responsive and beautiful.  The car is pure, not fancy regarding features ...lacks navigation, heated seats, bluetooth, etc.  But if you are looking for a great sportscar that virtually has not changed for 15 years, its because Honda created perfection from day one."

acura,nsx,2017,T. F Malik, 04/30/2017,90% of Porsche 918 at 80% discount,pos,"Super handling super car that blends the qualities of Ferrari and Porsche nicely in a relatively affordable package if ordered with the only essential option of Carbon Ceramic disk brakes. Can be a daily use car except in snow and ice unless equipped with proper tires and clearance issues with snow as it has pretty low clearance and no option to raise the car to clear the snow. Acceleration is instant, thanks to electric assist that takes away the turbo lag, torque vectoring with the front electric motors works transparently to assist in carving turns at any speed.

acura,nsx,2017,Eric, 01/06/2018,this is the best car that i have ever owned,pos,"Ive owned a Ferrari, Audi R8, Porsche, Jaguar, Lexus and others. i had the old Acura NSX and this blows away all of the cars that I've owned.
"
acura,nsx,2017,Jaws, 03/09/2018,New Sports Experience,pos,"Just amazing car!!!  I have always been a Porsche 911 loyalist and decided to check out this semi-exotic. I have been blown away. 

Using as my daily driver, the comfort and performance are unmatched together. The distinction in driving modes allows me to always find a level that suits my mood. 

Not quite understanding Edmunds 3 star rating when comparing to the competition, especially when you add in the Honda/Acura reliability to the equation. 

Yes, a bit more storage would be nice, the trunk should be better insulated against temperature, and they could have found a way to offer blind-spot monitoring, but for an everyday supercar that looks distinguished from the sea of Porsches and more common R8s which you can actually drive everyday, this is the real deal. "
acura,nsx,2017,Jeff Boldt, 08/28/2019,Very Happy With NSX,pos,"My wife and I love the looks of this white NSX with many carbon fiber highlights. It also goes like as Meatloaf says ""a bat out of hell"". My kids (30s) bring friends over for a ride. Electronics are good, but I'm having trouble getting the 10-years of free map updates to work or the garage door opener to work. Trunk looks small at first, but is very wide and as long as you use soft luggage (e.g. duffel bags) it holds plenty for several days of travel. Very easy to drive. My wife said she would never drive a super-car, but she drove it half of the way home from the dealer and said, ""It drives like a normal car"". Well unless you put your right foot down. It's quiet in sport mode, which I like. We love the red-black interior and the seats are very comfortable. It gets a lot of double-takes. I'm very happy with this purchase.

acura,nsx,2020,Dan, 03/11/2020,Frighteningly Fast,pos,Go drive one. Make sure before you do you are cleared by your doctor and have no heart problem.
acura,rdx,2007,K Smith, 11/27/2015,225K and going strong,pos,"I've had no maintenance or repair problems with my RDX. All maintenance at Acura dealership. No repairs beyond scheduled service. Drive 25K/yr in Northern and Central Valley California. Most miles on I-5 at 70 mph. Also into Sierra foothills in light snow.  Acceleration is great entering highway and passing on 2 lane roads. 

Only negative comments -  suspension is very tight. Wonderful for cornering but bothersome on poor roadways at highway speed.  I still prefer it to my wife's 2007 MDX.   Premium fuel required but knew this when I bought it. Interior is great except center console armrest is thin vinyl that began to wear and tear after 4 years.   Mentioned to dealer and they acknowledged that other owners had same complaint. Overall great car, hoping to get 50K more on it waiting for Tesla Model 3.
"
acura,rdx,2007,binh, 01/17/2007,Best SUV for us!,pos,Me and my wife absolutely love this car. We were previous owners of an RX8 and making the switch to an suv/cuv we expected loss on the fun factor. Turns out this car is a lot of fun to drive and feels solid all around. Gas mileage has been around the 19/20mpg with mixed driving. Everything I had hoped for.
acura,rdx,2007,ECB, 12/06/2006,No substantial complaints. Great SUV,pos,"Purchased mine 2 weeks ago and have put on about 800 miles.  The RDX handles amazingly and accelerates extremely well, very much like a sports car and far better than any other SUV. The technology package is a must. Acura/Honda has the best navigation system around.  The handsfree capability is also impresive. Cargo room is good, as well is storage room in the RDX. Interior build quality is quite good; the leather seats are extermely comfortable. Sound system is, by far, the best I have heard in any car. I have averaged 21 mpg and I'm anticipating a slight gain when the car breaks in.  Please keep in mind that I do about 70% highway driving and I am a fairly conservative driver "
acura,rdx,2007,Charlie, 04/22/2016,THICK IN THIN RDX IS A GREAT QUALITY VEHICLE,pos,"The 2007 4 C Turbo eats premium gas in daily city grinding/driving.  HOWEVER - exceptional reliability, incredible performance in torrential rain (Upstate New York), lots of snow (upstate & downstate- NY blizzards), cruised through major hills (Smokey Mountain),  saved my life as well!  The exceptionally strong metals used around the ""passenger cage"" deflected a blown Truck Caliper that sharded and exploded ahead of me - tore through two other cars then into mine - did not penetrate into the cabin - only deflected through a part of the undercarriage and did minimal damage under the passenger door side.  138K miles, still runs beautifully.  Only major change was to the front struts recently (GET THE KYOBI BRAND MONROE DOES NOT FAIR WELL IN THIS CAR)- NYC POTHOLES) and all discs and Break pads from www.handa-accessories.com.  Mobil Synthetic Oil  - car still runs like new.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Acura Lover, 10/11/2010,Hard to Beat an Acura,pos,"This is my third Acura.  I traded a BMW X3si for this RDX.  I had the BMW only 5 months.  Before that, I had an Acura TL.  Always wanted a BMW until I actually owned one.  Proved to myself I am an Acura fan for life.  This is my first 4-cyl car.  Turbo makes it feel like a V6.  Comfortable ride, quality interior expected from an Acura.  Tech pkg is nice, but could be much improved.  Feel like I went downhill from the 03 TL to the 07 RDX on that end.  This RDX really makes me feel as though my TL got a face and body lift.  Don't miss the BMW one bit except for the Bluetooth.  I hate pressing the talk button for each and every command; even my 03 Yukon doesn't require that. "
acura,rdx,2007,cg, 01/21/2007,Why I bought this car over others,pos,"I have a BMW 323i and love it. I bought a lexus 330 3 years back b/c BMW does not do well in snow :) Lexus is a smooth car but NO excitment to drive.. I was looking for a car w/ good in the snow, comfortable to drive long distance, fun to drive, can hold 4 people comfortably, good cargo area - the RDX fit the bill for all these. Being a female, I find most of the SUVs are TOO big and too heavy for me. This car feels like a sports sedan, except that it is taller and wider.  The turbo give you the 'peep' of  sporty ride. Yes there is more driving noise then a Lexus, but it's a trade off for performance."
acura,rdx,2007,"My 3rd ""Honda""", 09/09/2010,Do your research,pos,"I bought a certified 2007 last month with 33k miles on it after lots of research.  This is a great car. Gets 20mpg city/hwy which is just what I hoped for with a 3900lb turbo vehicle. It handles like a dream. It hugs curves like no other. The ride is bumpy, but not as bad as other SUV/ CUVs I've been in.  This car is FAST! I'm not a lead foot, but I punched it a couple times and I was gone! The seats are comfortable and supportive. There's lots of leg room in the back. The cargo area with seats up or seats down is more than adequate for this class and  size of vehicle. This is a great vehicle for a family of 3. It nice after driving an Accord for 15 years not to see myself coming and going."
acura,rdx,2007,Josho, 12/11/2006,"Great crossover, a blast to drive.",pos,"This car is really fun to drive. There's basically no turbo lag; hit the gas, and off you go. It's surprisingly quick. The real joy comes from the SH-AWD system, which helps you stick to the road in any conditions, but especially when things get slick. The gas mileage is a bit worse than advertised, but still better than most, if not all, SUVs. The standard RDX comes with so much standard, you're better off buying a 3rd party nav system, and saving a bunch on the sticker. With so much standard, why pay another $4K for bluetooth and a back-up camera? Overall, a great buy at the standard level!"
acura,rdx,2007,dorianf, 11/22/2006,Terrific Alternative To German Models,pos,"I buy a new car every six to seven years, alternating with my spouse.  I bought the RDX with a need to buy something upscale and fun.  Also winter handling and cold weather features were other concerns.  Here was my must have list and what the RDX provided: heated seats, standard; heated outside mirrors (hate scraping), standard; AWD, standard, XM or Sirius radio; XM standard (better channels than Sirius and no Howard Stern); Bluetooth; standard; good acceleration; standard, and very good I might add; classy; standard - even without the BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes nameplate.  Okay, there was another sort of must-have that the RDX did not give me: auto-headlights."
acura,rdx,2007,Wayne Shaffner, 12/28/2006,My RDX,pos,"My RDX has many great technological features, however some important ones to me were left off. My TL had seat memory for the drivers seat. This was a great feature for me because people at the dealership move the seat all the time, and it takes me a week to get it perfect again. No power seat for the passenger is also missed by my wife. Drivers side mirror does not tilt down. Rear lift gate should be remote controlled both from the remote lock / unlock and the dash as the trunk was on the TL. "
acura,rdx,2007,harvey agustin, 11/24/2006,I love the sports mode of RDX,pos,It's fun to drive using the sports mode. I never had a car this fast and stable at high speeds. My average mileage after 3000 miles is around 17-18 miles per gallon both city and highway driving combined. 
acura,rdx,2007,changomo, 12/26/2006,No Brainer for *This* Segment,pos,"This is not the perfect car, but it is the perfect choice for the entry level small-luxo-SUV market.  Felt the RAV4 and CX7 were not as refined.   X3 is the only real competitor in this segment.  The X3 was a nice car, but would cost about $10K more similarly equipped.  I thought the ride was a bit fairer on the BMW, but I felt the handling and power on the RDX was superior.  It has ridicoulous amounts of technology, plenty of power, and sport-sedan like handling."
acura,rdx,2007,NorCalJ, 01/03/2007,First Tank RDX,pos,First tank 19.7 mpg mixed highway (60%) and city (40%) with some aggressive driving mixed with mostly conservative driving. Drove up to Tahoe in snow and the AWD worked great. Love the car so far. 
acura,rdx,2007,AJ22Flight, 01/31/2007,RDX Rocket!,pos,"I have owned this for a week now and I could not be more impressed with this car.  I traded my 2002 TL and can't believe how much better the RDX handles.  Acceleration is great for a two ton auto.  The fit and finish of the interior is second-to-none with a smartly designed cockpit and great seats.  I got the tech package and the ELS sound system rocks!  Nav is easy to use, handsfree bluetooth works like a charm.  I have read many reviews from others complaining about the gas mileage.  I am averaging 17.5 after 600 miles of mixed driving.  If you are constantly stomping on the gas (and jamming on your brakes) you'll get 12 mpg.  You only need to feather the gas pedal and the turbo will move you!"
acura,rdx,2007,S. Banks, 03/16/2018,Most Reliable Vehicle I've Ever Owned!!!,pos,"I will definitely be replacing this vehicle with another Acura RDX.  Extremely reliable vehicle!
"
acura,rdx,2007,HowdyKeith, 01/16/2007,Cool Car!,pos,"My car is my office as I put a lot of miles on my car.  The RDX sold me on several points: 1) its outward style; 2) its interior design; 3) the Technology Package (outstanding audio and navigational system!); 4) the quality, fit, and finish of the interior materials; 5) the comfortable driver's seat; 6) its handling and performance; 7) the excellent warranty; 8) and Acura's reputation for building excellent cars and providing great service.  The RDX has been very fun to drive thus far.  Some might say that it drives too harsh; however, I am more than willing to sacrifice a little cushiness for the excellent handling and road feel the RDX provides.  Additionally, this car really turns heads! "
acura,rdx,2007,rcizme, 05/26/2009,Love my RDX,pos,"Although some call it an SUV it's not.  I don't drive it off road and don't plan to but on snow covered mountain roads it out handles my 4x4 Explorer in every way.  The SH-AWD is one of the best I've ever driven.  On performance, I didn't buy it as a race car but I drive over a mountain pass to work every day and this car doesn't work very hard climbing the grade AND with just over 50K miles, I'm averaging 24 MPG.  I'm confused as to why so many complain about poor fuel economy.  I'm guessing that mileage figures vary with driving habits?  It's not a race car... don't drive it like one."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX LOVER, 08/29/2009,I REALLY Know This Car,pos,"I'm a sales rep and drive approximately 40,000-45,000 miles a year for work. I've owned the RDX for a little more than two years and have 94,000 miles on it. I LOVE THIS CAR! The quality is excellent, the power & handling is excellent. The features of the tech pkg are great and reliable. I get compliments about this car all the time because of its styling and luxury. As long as you don't stand on the throttle and use up the turbo all the time, you get respectable gas mileage. I usually get 20-21 mpg in mixed driving conditions. When I'm aggressive I get 18-19 mpg. Due to a sporty suspension some may not like to feel every bump. You get a lot for the money. Compare the features to others."
acura,rdx,2007,mike, 11/06/2006,I Love My Techno RDX,pos,"I researched all the new models extensively before deciding on my purchase of the RDX with Technology package.  This is an incredible vehicle for the price.  The fit and finish are better than my last Mercedes ML, as is the technology and handling.  I've owned the vehicle for 6 weeks and still look for errands to run just for the fun of driving it."
acura,rdx,2007,palsons99, 12/18/2006,2007 Acura RDX,pos,"First off, there is no small SUV out there that is as fun to drive as this car. I tried the mazda and subaru equivalents, and they just don't match the feel of this car. This car is just a blast to drive. "
acura,rdx,2007,Dzenan, 12/30/2006,Great car for the money,pos,"I used to work for a valet parking co. and drove all kinds of cars, but nothing like this. The RDX has the punch, it is techno loaded, interior & exterior design is superb."
acura,rdx,2007,Mary , 01/20/2007,You'll fall in love...,pos,This vehicle handles like a dream. I was reluctant to purchase an SUV because of their traditional fuel consumption but this vehicle gets pretty decent milage. The interior has the feel of a sports car and the turning radius is awesome.  Safety was a big deal for me and the RDX has almost everything you could ask for in security at an affordable price.  This is my second Acura and it is every bit as impressive as the first.  There is also much to be said about the way Acura cares for their customers.  I'm an Acura customer for life.
acura,rdx,2007,Amy G Schmid, 09/19/2017,Sporty RDX,pos,"I have had my 2007 RDX since 2009. It is a beautiful, reliable car that hits high speeds with it's turbo engine that makes it fun to drive. The stereo is good, seats are comfortable and sunroof lets the sun in. I plan on driving this SUV until it decides to stop. I highly recommend this vehicle!
"
acura,rdx,2007,Doug Jordan, 07/05/2018,A 12 years' remembrance,pos,"It has remained exceptionally reliable.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Rusty, 11/27/2006,Super Fun to drive!,pos,I have had my RDX now for 1.5 months and I love it. It is the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned. The power is great! The cornering on snow and ice has been exceptional. I have already been through 3 blizzards! I never dreamed that this car would be so much fun! Sound system is the best ever experienced!
acura,rdx,2007,Ben, 12/19/2006,Special car,pos,"Have had the RDX tech package for about 2 months now. Love the bluetooth and other tech features. Car has the room I need without being too big. Would have preferred manual transmission. I find the car very comfortable, I see some complaints about the ride, I have had cars on either side of the RDX and personally wouldn't want to give up any of the fine handling that would undoubtedly be lost with a more plush ride. I would have considered the 21 MPG that I am getting fine several years ago. Next time around I can't imagine that I would even consider a car with this type of mileage. Very happy with RDX quality, feel, and image."
acura,rdx,2007,george, 08/10/2015,"after 9yrs/50k+ miles, i would buy it again",pos,"the first thing I said in my previous updates is still the first thing i have to say this time... ""quick"". this vehicle is very quick.

there is a slight turbo lag but when the turbo kicks in...you're gone. the quickness is maintained as long as you keep the turbo engaged. the quickness does not fade as your speed increases. and if you use the paddle shifters, forget about it. with the 4WD, even on wet surfaces, you get great acceleration and it handles very well.

the ride is very comfortable and the back seats sit higher than the front seats so you don't get that claustrophobic feeling. 

it's no wonder that acura doesn't make the tiny 2.3L 4cyl turbo SH-AWD anymore...probably couldn't sell their MDXs. 

I got my cruise control button fixed at the last review. still working.

since my last review, I had to find the broken wire causing my rear defroster failure. I had to recharge my a/c. a total of $180. both working.

also now the covering on the door armrest is peeling. that could be a lot my fault as it has to be pouring rain before I close my windows so it got wet frequently.

the only other interior problem is still minor, the covering on the center console arm rest has now pealed off entirely (JUST the covering, the cushioning and its covering are still intact and the arm rest is fully functional; just doesn't look great)  but otherwise the upholstery is in excellent condition. 

I STILL have ONLY 2 gripes with the car... premium gas for the turbocharger and the rear windows don't go all the way down. ya can't have it all.

if anyone is keeping track, I haven't changed my mileage in my reviews because I STILL haven't broken 80K miles. I am just over 78k now. I ride my bikes pretty much all the time, even to work.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Andy, 08/12/2016,Reliable and sporty small suv,pos,"This review is on my moms 2007 Rdx, bought new in 2006 on my recommendation, which I have driven on and off over the past 10 years, including 10 hour road tips, mountain ski trips in the snow, etc.  She now has around 100k miles on it and has not had a single trip for unscheduled maintenance in that time.  Acceleration is quick for an suv and the handling is sporty and precise.  Ride is quite firm, you will feel every bump in the road, but the chassis feels solid.  The sh-awd handles great in the snow and it was a great vehicle to take on ski trips.  Passenger and cargo space is reasonable and visibility is good.  Stereo is good and materials are nice but not overly luxurious.  Only negatives are requiring premium fuel for the turbo engine, and averaging only around 18mpg (90% stop and go city driving.). Road trips to the mountains I would be lucky to eek out 23-24 mpg.  Buy this for its Honda reliability and being fun to drive, not for its gas mileage.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Critical, 07/28/2009,The Family Sportscar!,pos,"Absolutely great car.  Tech package is easy to use.  Here's the bad things... interior plastic scratches easy, 19 to 20 mpg avg., 92 octane gas.  That being said this is the best car I've ever owned.  I'm a ""car nut"" and backyard mechanic, this car is extremely easy to maintain.  I'll drive this car till it dies!     "
acura,rdx,2007,jingo, 01/12/2007,Go!,pos,"I bought this car to replace a small hatchback that got totaled in an accident. I feel very comfortable with all its safety features, and it handles very well. I never was fan of SUVs, but I really love this car. I was looking at the BMW, but in the end I thought the RDX was simply a better ride. I also like the fact that I don't see these very often since it's a new model. I live in L.A., and I think I've only seen one or two others on the street. It's a very hip car!"
acura,rdx,2007,Mel Vento, 02/12/2019,Best car I've ever owned,pos,"I bought my 2007 new and it is now 12 years old and has 166,000 miles. Other than the airbag recall this car has had no mechanical issues which is amazing.  This is the most reliable car I have ever owned and so fun to drive.  The turbo and handling makes it feel like a race car and the safety rating was top of it's class.
"
acura,rdx,2007,stevieharris, 10/08/2006,Putrid gas mileage,neu,"Neat car, but stupendously bad gas mileage.  We got 11MPG on the first tank, 13MPG on the second tank and have not hit more than 13MPG since.  This is computing MPG the old fashioned way.  Our local dealer (PA) has more than 20 of these on the lot unsold, they said that they ""had deposits"" on them, but they don't.  I see why now.  Like the car, but this gas mileage is just really, really, really bad."
acura,rdx,2007,Blueman, 02/07/2018,Gas Hog!!,pos,"The Car is very Nice, Except for the Poor Gas Mileage!!!!  Running on Premium Gas the four cylinder turbo sucks up the gas, I only get 20 Highway - 11 in town!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"
acura,rdx,2007,rsbell, 08/12/2006,Great SUV,pos,"I've only owned the vehicle for 1 day, but have put 300 miles on it.  There IS some turbo lag, but once the turbo winds up, you're pressed to the back of your seat.  A bit smaller than I expected, but appears to have ample rear space, especially with the back sets folded flat.  Very nice, leather.  The tech package is with voice control is very detailed, and very complicated.  Will definitely take a few good days of use to get all of the commands andm options down, but looks to be well worth the effort."
acura,rdx,2007,ever_green, 05/09/2009,Best CUV out there for the Money,pos,"This car is great. Oops I mean SUV. Well same thing real for this ""CUV"". Sometimes you forget it's an SUV with its excellent acceleration and sport suspension. You feel the road unlike any other SUV out there. It feels more like my friend's BMW 3s. Apart from performance Acura offers excellent interior design with everything you need, really. Comfortable heated leather seats, Dual zone AC & so on...The super handling AWD also helps on snow and offroad. even though this car is not designed for offroading I still do it and it feels just as good as my highlander on dirt and light muddy roads. Only thing I'm unhappy about is the MPG in hwy. I get 21MPG."
acura,rdx,2007,Debbie, 03/03/2018,Love it,pos,"I still love my ride smooth and attractive
"
acura,rdx,2007,Acuralover, 10/08/2006,Surprising disappointment from Acura,neu,"I've owned 5 Honda and Acura products before, and this is a HUGE disappointment!! The 4-banger feels sluggish from a standstill (although it's reasonably quick after the initial lag). The engine is very noisy during acceleration, with a lot of turbo whine (even under some cruising conditions) which ""wears down on you"" after a while. And I was SHOCKED by the horrendous fuel economy. At 16 mpg overall (mix of hwy/city), it's exactly the same as my other vehicle: V8 powered Lexus GX470! Isn't this supposed to be a 4 CYLINDER, SMALL SUV? Helllooo!!"
acura,rdx,2007,rskdsk, 08/17/2006,"Fun SUV, but gas milage could be better",pos,"It is really to early to tell alot, however my first tank of gas seem to yield me only 13.5MPG ... and I did not dog the SUV.  This may be because the engine needs to break in, but with my last acura (MDX) getting poor gas milage, I am starting to see a trend.  This vehicle is very confortable and the handeling is great (for a SUV).  The exterior could be better, but still very nice.  I paid just over sticker ($150) ... not bad so far.  The brakes seem a bit weak, but again they may need to seat and the intial take off torque is nonexisitant, but once the turbo spools, it has a good punch."
acura,rdx,2007,Alex Harris, 09/05/2006,Bad gas mileage,pos,"The gas mileage on this car is horrific.  The EPA is 19/23 but thus far we have had no tank higher than 13 MPG and our average is 12.8 MPG.  I took the car to the dealer and they said that ""the gas mileage on the RDX isn't great"".  Wow is that an understatement.  If I had known that the mileage would be this bad I would never have purchased this car.  The car is great otherwise, but it only takes premium gasoline and the gas costs are now more than double my prior car (a V6 Honda Accord).  I am really disappointed that Acura put this car out with such bad gas mileage and there's no way out now, I estimate that my additional annual gas costs will be about $2500 per year, which is insane."
acura,rdx,2007,NemoUmbra, 09/29/2006,Base 2007 Acura RDX (CAN),pos,Car drives nicely although the sportier ride can be a bit too harsh at times for normal day to day driving.  Gas mileage has been quite reasonable (12.3L/100km or 19.1 mpg) but I've had to watch the turbo indicator to use the turbo as little as possible.  Hills seem to make the turbo kick in quite a bit as expected which really drains the gas quite quickly.  Cruising at relatively high speeds while feathering the gas to keep up with traffic seems to make the turbo kick in oddly causing seemingly choppy driving.  Blind spots are quite minimal as the mirrors and small size help counteract this.
acura,rdx,2007,idr, 10/11/2006,Good but needs improvement,neu,"Before buying, I really suggest taking the local roads rather than just hopping onto the closest freeway with no radio on.   I was very annoyed with a shaking/vibrating steering wheel every time I waited in front of the red light.  During acceleration, I found the turbo to be rather loud.  The gas mileage could also be improved.  On the other hand, great visibility and comfortable seats in both front and back.  Excellent design as well.  The ride is also very comfortable when compared to a sport X3.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Brillo, 11/28/2006,"Great handling, poor mileage",pos,"The car is fun to drive, handles very well, excellent quality and features. Only disappointment is a 3+ MPG gap in rated numbers versus actual. Avg 19-20 in semi rural and highway driving.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Glen, 12/25/2015,"Japanese quality, German performance",pos,"The 2007 model drives and handles like a 5 series BMW. The seats hold you securely on spirited curves. Later models were softened up and ""family car"" dumbed down. If you want fun, get a 2007. If you want a polite quality family car, get a later model.
"
acura,rdx,2007,Phundriver , 11/27/2019,"Reliable, Safe, Sporty!",pos,"The 2007 Turbo RDX SWX is by far the best vehicle I’ve owned following Audi, Mercedes, Lexus.  Buy it if you can find it!  Premium sound!  Handles like a sports car.  Drives like a smooth limo.  Again, if you find one in good well maintained shape.  BUY!  "
acura,rdx,2007,The Boss, 01/19/2007,The funnest car to drive,pos,"The car is great. It drives like a sports car, but it is a safe, small suv. Highly recommended."
acura,rdx,2007,diamondpearl, 10/21/2006,My point of view of RDX,neu,"It's been about 2 month since I purchased 07 RDX right after debut. I have really good image of honda also I had Acura RSX type S before and really liked it. That is why I decided to buy RDX. I am well satisfied with my purchase; however, I see the car is not well built. I happened to find many rattles from dashboards, passenger seat, and twitters. I hate that ticking sounds that dashboards makes.  This year RDX missing few things, and I dont see how a car at this pricepoint does not have these as standards: passenger power seat, memory seat for driver seat, auto-dim back and side mirrors."
acura,rdx,2007,Terrible car, 08/05/2010,Worst car ever purchased,neg,"In the first 3 months this brand new car was in the shop for electronic malfunctions, sunroof malfunction, rear hatch cracked, turbo replaced, warning light indicator malfunction, ""flooding issues"" and engine noise.  This has been our worst experience with a car purchase, Acura service was terrible along with Acura Canada's response.  I would NOT recommend this car, it is noisy, rough and unreliable."
acura,rdx,2007,Bink, 11/26/2006,Boutique SUV,neg,"Poor gas mileage on premium - 18.3 MPG on mostly freeway driving.  I used to average 16.9 MPG with my 4.7 L Jeep 4x4.  Very uncomfortable ride on 18"" tires - bounces down the road.  No interior space or trunk space in spite of being longer than my Grand Cherokee.  It feels like you're in an airplane cockpit.  No pep when you step on it.  High maintenance cost as it requires premium and special oil, 4 times the cost of regular oil.  I can't wait to get rid of it in the spring."
acura,rdx,2007,def, 10/21/2006,Love it!,pos,We love our RDX.  I no longer mind driving anywhere.  It is fun to drive and I feel very safe.  With the fold down seats I can haul a lot.  This car is so comfortable and has a great sound system.
acura,rdx,2007,rdxster, 10/23/2006,A great SUV - fun to drive,pos,We picked it up this weekend and so far it's been all fun. This is a great SUV and drives like a sports car. We had a Maxima GLE but this has way more zip and is great in cornering and feel.
acura,rdx,2007,Greg B, 11/21/2006,Loving it so far,pos,"Have been ""in love"" since seeing first RDX on highway more than a month ago.  Picked mine up (black, tan interior) last week, and have been smiling ever since.  Cannot recommend it enough. "
acura,rdx,2007,sad rdx, 05/31/2008,Turbo is design flaw,neg,"Be very careful of the RDX: the front end has a problem that will need to be addressed - it feels a little like the shocks but it isn't.  The turbo has a major problem - my car has been in the shop for over a week they are tearing it down and do not have any idea what is wrong; no warning indicators it may have cracked the head but the dealership isn't talking.  They do not know why the turbo is malfunctioning but it appears at the 50,000 mile mark you can look for major issues of course that is when the warranty expires.  Powertrain is 70,000.  Everytime I have had to deal with warranty issues (3 dealerships) they try not to fix.  Good luck sorry you have this car and sorry I have this car.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Turbo Fan, 05/08/2009,Want a sport sedan needed an suv,pos,"I chose the RDX because I wanted sport sedan like handling and power but the utility of an SUV. Gas mileage is not as bad as some say. If I ease into the throttle, I can get about 25mpg highway with some city driving. Ride is firm, but you get lots of grip. Sport mode tranny is neat but not necessary. This is my first turbo engine and overall I like the power surge; surprising that a 2.3L can feel this strong in a 3,900lb vehicle. Turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 CX7 and 2009 Subaru Forester I drove. RDX felt more powerful than CX7 despite having less advertised hp and one fewer gear. Glad I spent the extra money and chose the RDX over the CX7.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Chapel Hill, 05/22/2009,Excellent peformance crossover,pos,"We purchased an '07 RDX brand new when they first came out (we purchased in Aug '06).  We are in the process of selling it, not because we want to, but because our family has simply outgrown it.  We put 40k miles on it in almost 3 years of ownership and have thoroughly enjoyed the RDX.  We've used it around town & on family trips.  Extremely reliable.  Quiet ride.  Incredibly comfortable interior w/ awesome styling.  Multiple compartments for storage, & many tech features.  Front & back seats are quite roomy & backseat easily folds down flat (2/3 / 1/3) to expand cargo space.  The AWD RDX drives better than most performance cars - handling is incredible & it is a fun, solid drive/ride."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX, 08/21/2006,RDX First in Colorado,pos,"Just bought one of the first in Colorado. It's awesome! Fun to drive, decent gas mileage, looks great inside and out! TONS of power for a 4cyl. Deffinately recommend buying..."
acura,rdx,2007,Eric, 08/22/2006,2007 RDX with Tech Pkg.,pos,"An exceptionally fun to drive small suv with technology that will make you grin. Abundant power that is enjoyable but takes some getting used to. The turbo feels well tuned and is mild at first then spools up to deliver smooth, lag free acceleration. It's Nav system and voice recognition software really work well. The stereo is so good you'll be the envy of not just audiophiles but anyone with ears! It's better than the several thousand dollar aftermarket set up I have in my other vehicle.  Basically, consider it an impressive blend of MDX utilty, TSX performance and RL luxury.   "
acura,rdx,2007,betsy_me, 09/05/2006,13.65 MPG,pos,"Car is great BUT gas mileage is terrible.  Dealer says to wait until 2000 miles before bringing it in, but we have 1300 miles on it coming back from a trip north, and we cannot break 14 MPG.  Most of the drive was highway."
acura,rdx,2007,TColeman, 09/28/2006,Great Crossover SUV,pos,"My wife wanted her latest vehicle to be an SUV.  After looking at a few and noting the sticker price, we decided to test drive the RDX.  Hands down it drove and felt better than a Toyota Highlander and Mazda CX-7.  The engine has plenty of pep, the interior has plenty of luxury, and the Tech package has plenty of toys.  The HandsFree Link for a Bluetooth phone works great and the voice-activate NAV system is impressive...lots of voice commands to learn.  No problems with gas mileage. We are very pleased with our first venture into a luxury line of automobiles."
acura,rdx,2007,k, 10/06/2006,"Fun to drive, poor mpg",neu,"Great pickup and handling for an SUV. The tech gadgets are fun.  My first tank of gas gave me 16 mpg - my Porsche gets 19 mpg combo and 27 mpg freeway. It makes me wonder what Acura was thinking when they designed this engine. If the mpg doesn't go near the lowest stated mpg after break-in, then there is a problem."
acura,rdx,2007,Bryan, 10/09/2006,24 MPG on the HWY,pos,I have made 2 round trip between Baton Rouge and New Orleans driving on Interstate 10. The trip computer said that I was getting 24.1 MPG @ 65 MPH. I didn't notice any turbo lag when I punched it while driving around town. Steering pulls to the right somewhat. Don't know if it is an alignment problem or not.
acura,rdx,2007,Vern from Florida, 10/26/2006,2007 RDX Tech deluxe,pos,"I use on line reviews a lot but don't often have time to give back. I'd like to here. This is my 5th Acura and first SUV. I traded a 2005 RL which was nice but not nearly as much fun and functional as this. It's fun, cool and for a 56 year old guy, it fits my needs perfectly. Who says it has to go to upwardly mobile 30ish types?"
acura,rdx,2007,On the road again, 11/13/2006,RDX - let 'er roll,pos,Purchased an RDX two weeks ago. Previously owned a Honda CRV and loved it.  Wanted to upgrade and stay with a Honda.  Getting 22 mpg for normal highway driving.  Could easily get less with the peppy turbo if you stand on it.  Great handling both on straightaways and curves and a solid built vehicle.  A litte stiff ride but quiet interior with awesome stereo system.  Love the navigation system but it takes some time to learn the commands. Bluetooth is awesome and great for making/answering calls while traveling.  Tilt down right passenger mirror is helpful when backing as well as rear viewing camera. Gauges are well placed and lighted both day and night.  Overall pleased so far.
acura,rdx,2007,Curtis, 11/17/2006,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",pos,"I had been looking for a tall (better line of sight) performance vehicle that has better interior and comfort than the X3.  It turns out that the RDX has a much nicer interior and ride.  I am very happy with the price and value of this terrific car.  I do not notice any turbo lag.  I do notice that it accelerates like a jet and handles like a nimble sedan.  To quote Burgess Meredith: ""It eats lightning and craps thunder!""  It is the younger, faster, and more fun brother to my RX 330!  The stereo even sounds incredible and has sold me on xm radio!"
acura,rdx,2007,Charles Hatley, 11/16/2006,So fun to drive,pos,I love pulling up to people in sports cars at red lights and knowing how surprised they are when my little SUV takes off like a rocket!  This is the most fun drive I've ever had.  The quality of the interior is incredible... blows my old VW away!
acura,rdx,2007,GNV, 01/16/2007,Great Car,pos,Technology package is superb. Fit and finish interior also superb. Seats are very comfortable - esp given size of car. Only problem is gas mileage and it requires premium fuel. If Acura corrects this they would have a more sought after car.
acura,rdx,2007,lukeivic, 06/23/2007,Performance,pos,"My husband already owns the Acura TL.  So we wanted the MDX (awesome vehicle too).  But we saw the RDX - good price, great quality and it had all of the bells and whistles as the MDX.  I have been driving it since January and I love it.  It is everything they said it would be. However, it is a ladies car because of the size.  You have a luxury car for a great price.  "
acura,rdx,2007,J. Wood, 10/17/2007,"""A Well Kept Secret""",pos,"I knew this was the car for me the first time I test drove it. I tried other small SUVs in this range, i.e, Lexus, Murano, and there was no comparison.  This car has a solid compact feeling.  I was not aware of this car. Someone talked me into seeing it. It's a quality car and handles well in bad road conditions (heavy rain storms and wind).  I love the turbo power when I need to accelerate in traffic. The interior is classy & the techology is state of the art. I highly recommend this car.  It's fun to drive - I look forward to driving everyday."
acura,rdx,2007,FTNSS1, 11/15/2007,I'm in love....,pos,"I traded an '05 TSX for the RDX - needed more room for gear.  Not only is the RDX just the right size, it's actually MORE fun to drive!!  The SH-AWD system produces such grip and control that it almost feels like you're driving a sports car.  I've had no problems/repairs, the mileage is acceptable for an SUV (about 21 mpg), and the fun factor is a 10!  The ride is firm, but comfortable.  The interior is great (and versatile), the technology package is great."
acura,rdx,2007,Chad, 03/20/2008,This is a Driver's SUV,pos,"This car has been so fun to drive. Lots of reviews about the stiff ride, but that is one of the things I like about the car. Leather is very nice. Lots of fun gadgets, and voice command works very well. This car offers more for the money than any of its competitors, especially the overpriced BMW X3. If you have a family with a bunch of kids, get the GMC Acadia or Mazda CX-9 in this price-range. But for the young professional looking for an entry-level luxury SUV, this is the bomb. Even if I was willing to pay more for a car, I would still end up with the RDX, that's how much I've loved it. My wife drives a new audi, and has been jealous since I bought this. "
acura,rdx,2007,PaulT, 03/21/2008,Road Warriors Dream,pos,"Test drove Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, Range Rover and found the RDX beat them all. Performance, quality and driveability all exceeded my demands. Gas mileage has been an avg of 20 mpg. I spend 3-5 hours a days behind the wheel and this is an awesome ride. Just love it. "
acura,rdx,2007,michael, 04/23/2008,The Best of Both Worlds,pos,"I have been in the car business 18 years, and have had a few front drive cars and 4 rear drive pathfinders.  One day I was driving a front drive passenger vehicle and took a corner to fast and the rest is history.  That day I test drove the 07 RDX SW AWD and the rest is history. I have never owned an all wheel drive vehicle with VSA.  Being in the business, I have driven this vrossover hard.  It corners better than any thing I have ever driven. Bring on the rain.  Floor it from a dead stop and the car just launches forward, comfortable on long trips, the navigation is great."
acura,rdx,2007,Very Very Unhappy, 05/05/2008,In the shop three times already,neu,In the last Month my RDX has been in the shop three times and the last time it didn't even last a week before the emission light went on again and when it goes on it seem to shift down and have less power it has been in the shop this time for a week and they don't know what's wrong with it they are in contact with Japan now and still have no idea what's wrong. I'm probably going to trade it in once the find the problem. I can not trust this car. I thought Acura was a trusted car that had no problems I guess I was wrong.
acura,rdx,2007,Gaye Brown, 04/15/2018,Speedy luxury suv,pos,"Wonderful car for hauling customers around and to get to appointments in traffic.
"
acura,rdx,2007,jjc, 07/15/2010,Well balanced and fun to drive!,pos,"We just got this car used several weeks ago and are thrilled with it!  It is very fun to drive and has a nice kick. The car is a great balance of size, speed, practicality, and fun.  Plus, it looks sharp and is fast!  Both my wife and I love it. "
acura,rdx,2007,black satin, 11/02/2006,Quick midsize SUV,pos,I purchased the black satin looks great in that color. Quality compares to no other. Tech pkg. is the best out there.
acura,rdx,2007,Robert Small, 11/20/2006,Scratch Scratch Scratch,pos,"I drove a Volvo for 12 years and needed a change. The Acura attracted me because it was small. I also owned a Honda in the past.  The car handles well and dazzles but there is absolutely no body protection. It's a joke.  Everytime we park, the car boasts a new ding or dent. They should think about some body trim.  "

acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 02/22/2009,Floor Mat,neu,"This is my first and last Acura.  At 5K the driver's floor mat was worn through.  After some argument, the dealer agreed to replace it under warranty. The replacement lasted about the same.  While the overall interior quality appears acceptable, the carpeting and floor mats are very cheap.  Mileage is fair, but you must use premium fuel.  For the money, the vehicle is not worth the price."
acura,rdx,2007,Steve Cohen, 03/27/2016,Nice car until turbo failed,neg,"Check engine light came on at 92000 miles. The dealer diagnosed a failing turbo, around $4500 to fix. I don't expect a premium car to fail at this mileage. Also the ride is fairly harsh as is road noise. Fun to drive though. New Mercedes is so much nicer it revealed to me how crude this is and how much fatigue it caused on long trips.
"
acura,rdx,2007,susan, 10/09/2006,Fueled with fun,pos,"Fun car to drive traded in a 2002 TL was sort of nervous to get an SUV but have no regrets.  Quick, corners nicely, fuel economy could be better but then if I wanted fuel economy I should have bought a hybrid."
acura,rdx,2007,pete, 11/01/2006,So Far - So good,pos,So Far my RDX is working as advertised.  It handles well and is very responsive. I have the tech package and would highly recommend the addition.
acura,rdx,2007,mlb11, 02/25/2007,Awesome vehicle,pos,"I've owned the RDX for a month now and I still can't wait to drive it - I look for excuses. It handles magnificently and the turbo provides impressive power. Interior fit and finish is top notch and the seats are comfortable. When cruising at 80 it feels like you're doing 50 because it is so quiet and refined (the 4-cyl is only tach'ing 2800 at 80mph). Great handling and cornering as well with a ride that makes you feel in control. Driven it in two snowstorms and the SH-AWD & VSA performed excellently, keeping the car straight and in control."
acura,rdx,2007,MattAZ, 08/22/2007,Too Fun To Drive,pos,"Beside this being my 3rd Honda product (2000 Accord Coupe and then 2005 Acura TSX), I was looking for a bigger car than the TSX, but still wanted that performance and sportiness found in the TSX. The Lexus and BMW equivalents to the RDX can't even compare and the RDX is even more fun to drive than the TL! There are only a few improvements I would like to see, but overall, I have yet to be displeased by this car. Fast, sporty, good looking and yet extremely safe for the family and it has AWD - for a price of under 35K, you can't beat it. MPG for one year has averaged 19.8 - not bad. The car performs totally different in auto versus manual/paddle shifters. "
acura,rdx,2007,CB, 09/11/2007,Be careful of roof,neg,"We bought a new RDX two months ago and now have been hit with a $4,500 bill to repair the roofs complete collapse. We mounted a bike rack on the roof, virtually identical to the one Acura sells as an RDX accessory. My son got on the roof to make sure that the bikes were placed in the rack properly  just like weve done on other cars weve owned with bike racks. This turned out to be a giant mistake, even though Acura never states anywhere that you shouldnt do this. This time though the weak, badly- designed Acura roof collapsed. Acura will not cover this huge expense  so much for customer service. My advice: dont buy this car; especially if youre putting something on the roof."
acura,rdx,2007,crvols, 06/18/2008,"After One Year, love the Car",pos,"I bought this last year trading in my 2004 TL.  I have enjoyed it from the start, with no problems and average of 22 mpg on the road.  I wish they hadn't scrimped on things like interior lighting, passenger power seat, auto dimming mirror, etc., but that seems to be Honda's marketing approach.  At the end of the model run it will have everything you would expect!  Overall very happy after the first year with my purchase."
acura,rdx,2007,johnnymauler, 07/02/2008,The good and the bad.,pos,"After owning this vehicle for a year I am already tired of the non responsive automatic transmission.  I have driven manual transmissions for most of my life, but I wanted to have a SUV for the snow and portability.  I have to say I love everything else about this vehicle.  The handling is great, comfortable, roomy, tech package kicks, even the turbo 4 isn't so bad.  But the paddle shifters and transmission are sub par.  Shifts are slow and sloppy.  This vehicle should have made with a 6 spd manual.  Also the GPS is outdated."
acura,rdx,2007,HondaMoCoFan, 10/03/2008,The Little Things Add Up,neu,"I decided to trade in my TL for this because I wanted all wheel drive. I was disappointed to find out that the car lacked some features I thought would be standard across all models. Namely, the navigation screen was no longer touch screen (as my TL from a few years prior had been). I also found both the gas range prediction and mpg to be terrible. On a drive across the country in a torrential downpour, I checked my range vs. the nearest gas station. At the time (about 20 miles away), I had about 12-15 extra miles according to the trip computer. Suddenly, about 10 miles away it jumped to 9 miles and I wondered if I would even make it."
acura,rdx,2007,LoveACURA, 05/05/2009,Spoiled Honda Owner,pos,"I owned Hondas for years but strayed to AUDI a few years ago.  I loved the AWD of my AUDI but hated the UNreliability - I'll NEVER have another Audi. Finding AWD for under $40K was a challenge. LOVE my RDX - a suped-up Honda with AWD!  All the bells and whistles of a more expensive model but at a great price.  Gas mileage is wonderful when I drive it like a 4 cyl. When I need the power of a 6 cyl, I have it with the Turbo. Drive it like a 6 cyl and you'll too complain about the gas mileage.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Chuck W., 02/17/2008,Look elsewhere,neg,"Acura is a luxury brand, but this is not a worthy model.  It's quick and sporty with a stiff ride.  But gas mileage was terrible and we had to replace the front brakes and rotors every 5000 miles.  We never felt like it did anything well. If you drove it as a sports SUV with paddle shifters, you paid at the pump and in maintenance.  Also, missing some key features at this price including automatic headlights, driver memory settings and iPod interface."
acura,rdx,2007,Eric, 08/21/2006,Awesome IS RDX,pos,This Car says it all RDX is the most incredible suv on steroids the ride is superb and the agility witht ht sh-awd doesn;t make you move when you make a sharp turn just eay and pleasant...Awesome tag to high but still KICKS RDX
acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 08/27/2006,Fun ride!,pos,"I have just taken an RDX for a test drive. The engine is very peppy once it gets into turbo zone. On the downside, the gas mileage is negatively affected by the AWD that cannot be switched off. Another necessary improvement deals with the cargo space (my current TL has a larger trunk). Also, the back seats do not fold down, so there is no way in which you can expand the cargo space (why call it an SUV then?).  Overall, the new RDX is a fine car!"
acura,rdx,2007,William, 08/31/2006,RDX REVIEW,pos,We fell in love with this new SUV as soon as we saw it. Drives like a dream and is very quick and responsive. The interior is very plush. Great SUV..
acura,rdx,2007,Bob, 09/02/2006,Exceptional Quality,pos,"This is my 5th Acura. The drivability wasn't as smooth as some other SUVs I've driven but considering the ""sports package"" it's understandable. Power galore for a 4 cylinder. Maybe a bit overpriced but you get what you pay for."
acura,rdx,2007,Andy, 09/08/2006,All I can say is WOW!,pos,From the first moment I test drove this vehicle I was very impressed. It's amazing how much HP a 4 cylinder with a turbo can give you and not to mention the decent gas mileage. The handle on this vehicle is awesome compared to other small suvs thanks to its sh-awd.
acura,rdx,2007,SyracuseAcura, 09/09/2006,No Compromise,pos,After extensive driving I noted that the RDX really shines in a wide range of driving scenarios.  The rear seats DO fold down for a very flexible interior and abundant cargo room.  The car actually gets quieter over the break in period and it is a vehicle that definitely grows on you.  The performance and handling is impressive for a sport sedan let alone an SUV.  Get one and have fun.
acura,rdx,2007,Tom from New Jersey, 09/13/2006,One Terrific Small SUV,pos,"I wanted a small but very luxious SUV and the Acura RDX is the answer. I've owned my RDX for two weeks and I couldn't be happier. I was a little skeptical of going back to a 4 cylinder engine (even though I had owned many 4 cylinder cars in the past) since many newer small SUVs have 6s in them. However, so far I am thrilled with the performance. I have 450 miles on the car and have been averaging better than 22 miles per gallon. The quality of construction and interior cockpit materials are top notch.  I highly recommend this car if you want a superior small SUV with far more in the way of goodies (I have the technology package) than the BMW X-3 for about $4000 less in price. "
acura,rdx,2007,Lewis, 09/18/2006,Awesome High Tech SUV,pos,"I've had my RDX for two weeks and love it!  It's plenty powerful, has loads of futuristic technology, including a voice recognition system which works very well, and is lots of fun to drive.  I'm getting 23 comfortable miles per gallon around town and on the highway.  I looked at other SUVs and was impressed with the Acura's quality, performance and high tech features.   "
acura,rdx,2007,Cdangelo, 09/20/2006,The TRUTH about the gas mileage,pos,"I don't know how people are reporting milage in the 12-14 mpg range.  I drove an RDX from Albany, NY to Utica, NY and got 24 mpg with the cruise set at 70 mph.  This past weekend, on a trip to the lake, I got 20.7 avg.  I was going through the mountains.  In order to get 12-14 mpg, a person must be mashing to pedal and driving on the turbo constantly.  Also, the rear seats DO fold down, so who ever said they didn't, must not own the vehicle which they posted a review about."
acura,rdx,2007,Fast Freddy, 09/25/2006,Car of the Year 2007,pos,I have had my RDX for 3 weeks. It drives excellently. Acura is #1 in technology and luxury. Drive this SUV and fall in love with it.
acura,rdx,2007,Stevie, 09/22/2006,It's a great little SUV,pos,"I am very impressed and happy about this little car. Fun to drive and a lot of power for a 4-cylinder car. The Turbo really makes the difference. The fuel economy for the first 2 tanks of gasoline is not good, then as the car breaks-in, the mileage gets better. Nicely made and stylish. Love it."
acura,rdx,2007,Pacific, 09/23/2006,Great new SUV,pos,"Just a great car, and an even better value.  Very quick, responsive and fun to drive.  Have put over 2000 miles on it in less than a month while averaging a shade less than 22 MPG. No Turbo lag at all.  The gadgets are great especially the superb audio system, the rear camera, the voice activated controls and the traffic info.  Acuras have always been reliable and I expect no difference here. "
acura,rdx,2007,CJ, 09/25/2006,"Awesome, BUT missing a few critical options",pos,"Ok, if you have not driven an RDX, go do it now.  This is an awesome machine.  Yes you will feel a turbo lag from a dead stop, but you will be amazed how much power this little engine has, it really moves well.  The SH-AWD is just incredible, I took curves at 65 mph and you can see on the display which wheel is getting power, it is simply amazing.  I love all the tech gadgets, I am a gadget freak.  BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I WISH THEY CAN FIX.... one, NO MEMORY SEATS, what's up with that, this is a LUXURY brands, PLEASE give us memory driver's seat.  NO AC VENTS for the poor people in the back. Come on!!! a chevy has that.  Why can't Acura match the pwhite bumper to the white body.UGH"
acura,rdx,2007,Ed in Illinois, 09/27/2006,My First SUV,pos,"This is my 1st SUV and my 1st Acura. I couldn't be happier. The car is a blast to drive (love the turbo) and handles great. I wanted an AWD for the northern IL winters and the SH-AWD should be perfect. Interior looks and feels very nice and quality is heads above other SUVs that I test drove. The sound system is the biggest suprise. I read how good it was, but you cannot believe it until you actually hear it. The DVD-nav works great and helped me avoid a traffic jam driving home from the dealer the day I bought it. Highly recommended car."
acura,rdx,2007,Wedgebolt, 09/28/2006,WWWWOOOOOOWWWWWWWW,pos,I went in to the dealership just looking to test drive the RDX and ended taking one home. The RDX drives more like a sports car and I had to catch myself this morning when I was doing 90 mph without even feeling like I was speeding. Interior is well constructed but I feel like I am in a spaceship with all the buttons and features on this vehicle.
acura,rdx,2007,Bill, 10/04/2006,Great Car,pos,"Having driven Audi A8s for the last 9 years, I was a bit daunted by the thought of going to a smallish SUV.  But I wanted something smaller and better suited to a less formal lifestyle, and the RDX fit the bill. It is one great car!  Handling, performance, all are great.  The Technology Package is fantastic - voice recognition commands make using the Nav system a piece of cake.  And the sound system is the best I have ever heard in a car - it will blow you away, literally.  The XM radio is also super - digital surround sound must be heard to be believed."
acura,rdx,2007,drtimko, 10/04/2006,Great car but 18 MPG,pos,"Great car and just bought it last week.  I use it for business as a home care doctor, but 18 MPG is killing me.  The ride is great and acceleration is awesome with turbo.  The seats are a hard ride and wish they were softer.  Great interior look.  Best car in mini SUV category for the money.  Drove a 3 series BMW last car and this car handles very well.  Bluetooth not compatible with most Sprint phones.  That needs to be updated because Sprint big in my area."
acura,rdx,2007,NYC=Fun, 10/05/2006,Technology is fun,pos,"It's not often that I take the time to write about anything, however this crossover with the Tech. Package is a must. I have a Lexus RX and it doesn't hold a candle to the RDX. If you are looking for a sport car/suv you must test drive this one. You will be sold."
acura,rdx,2007,Dan, 10/05/2006,RDX,pos,"I wanted a sports car but needed the room of an SUV.  It performs like a sports car with agility, quickness and handling but offers more comfort than a sports car.  I evaluated the competitors but they could not compare for the difference in price.  I am satisfied!  "
acura,rdx,2007,patentcad, 10/09/2006,RDX exceeding expectations so far,pos,"It's impossible to convey the RDX's overall excellence in a brochure or 10 min test drive. After a week I'm THRILLED. More like an AWD TL station wagon. An SUV that out performs many sports sedans and handles like a Porsche 944. Superb passenger comfort. You sacrifice a little in the cargo area dept., but the car is perfectly adequate for our needs. We installed Thule cross bars and attachments to the factory roof rack. Fuel economy? I'm getting 17-18 city, 22-23 hwy and about 20 mpg combined. That will improve once the engine breaks in. On the gas guzzler issue - compare the RDX to real world mpg from other AWD wagons/small SUVs and you'll find it's better than most of them."
acura,rdx,2007,Falloonrd1, 10/10/2006,Acura RDX,pos,I am very impressed with this vehicle.  I had an 04 TSX and wanted something a little bigger.  The interior controls are well placed and easy to use.  The Nav is a lot better.  You can feel and hear the nice turbo engine.  I haven't had it long enough to comment on fuel ecomomy.
acura,rdx,2007,gomboy60, 10/12/2006,Fun car with lots of extra,pos,"Just got it the other day and I am very happy with the car. There are some complaints about the mpg but if one does not step on the accelerator all the time, (as any other car) the number should be very good. The ride is a bit bouncy at times but handling is superb. There is so much kick in the engine you won't even know it is I4. If you are not sure exactly what you want but in the market, take a test drive and you will be sold, esp with tech package. It provides everything and more at 12-14K less than that European ""thing"". Ext looks appears to be small but once inside, there is plenty of room. Happy motoring...  "
acura,rdx,2007,Zel, 10/19/2006,Fun to Drive,pos,"A great SUV.  My first Acura and SUV.  My family had a long h/o driving Mazdas but the CX-7 or Murano were no match.  The interior is just right and the body design turns heads.   I purchased 18"" Inspyre RonJon rims and they look great.  A definite recommendation to make it a bit sportier helped a bit.  As a single male in his 30s I am the demo they were going for and they succeeded!!"
acura,rdx,2007,Michael, 10/23/2006,RDX is Rockin!,pos,"Just purchased an RDX w/ tech - definitely worth the additional $3k.  Handles well, navigation, voice, gadgets are awesome.  First tank of gas was 21 mpg.  Turbo definitely works!  As long as you're not looking to haul anything or carry 10 people, definitely look at the RDX as an alternative to any SUV on the market."
acura,rdx,2007,J in AZ, 10/29/2006,I'm in Love!,pos,"I've had this vehicle for almost two months now and can't find anything yet that I do not like about it (2500 miles so far).  Yes, it gets between 18-20 MPG, but considering the 15 MPG I was getting with my minivan, I'm certainly not complaining.  I don't know how others are driving that get less than 15 MPG, but I've been pretty much right on the rating for the vehicle.  Love it!"
acura,rdx,2007,dostoyevsky77, 11/04/2006,"Fun car, but missing some small things",pos,"I bought this car for my wife.   First, this ""car"" is awesome.  It handles like it wants to be a sports sedan, but it has the luxury and utility to make it one of the best crossovers we test drove.  The peppy turbocharger makes it jump off the mark, and the ""super handling all wheel drive"" really improves the cornering.  Watch out for the AWD status display on the dash; you should have your eyes on the road whenever you actually need the torque to be redistributed!"
acura,rdx,2007,Tami, 11/06/2006,Love It !!,pos,Love the RDX/ Tech Package.  I've had the car for a month now and love driving it!! BUT  Im getting really bad gas mileage 12.5 mpg in the city really bad at average speed of 14 mph. Other than the poor gas mileage I love everything else about the SUV.  
acura,rdx,2007,Tami, 11/08/2006,Love it!!,pos,"Just bought the RDX a few weeks ago and I love it!!  This is my first SUV I test drove others but when I drove this I was sold.   However, my gas mileage is really bad. I've been getting 12.5 mpg.  Not good. I do not drive crazy or accelerate fast so I don't know what's up but not too happy about the gas mileage."
acura,rdx,2007,BornToDrive, 11/14/2006,Finest Car in its Class,pos,"I have a 300 RX Lexus but found it a little sloppy on the road. Yes it had a luxury ride and feel but wasn't quite what I wanted. Solution RDX with tech pak. It rocks, it has performance, ride, handling and about every bell and whisltle you can find a price that will not put you in the poorhouse. Go for it!  Tech pack a must!"
acura,rdx,2007,Mi Ami, 12/08/2006,Best Car I Ever Owned,pos,"From the second you open the door to this high tech monster you know you made the right choice. It is fast, secure, comfortable, fun, safe. The sound system is beyond the finest. Navagation - wow. This one is a no brainer to own. Best car I ever owned and I had them all. This is the least expensive and the best."
acura,rdx,2007,BVaughn, 12/11/2006,First year for Acura RDX,pos,"This is my first ""suv."" My previous cars included an Acura Integra and a Mercedes CLK320. It took about a month to adjust to a bumpier ride, but the handling is very similar to a car and not a truck. The sound system is excellent and the free XM radio for a couple months is nice too. The navigation system is also my first and I am thrilled with the detail in various map specs. The only real issue so far is that the battery mysteriously died at 1000 mi. Without a key in the ignition almost all electrical things shut off within 30 seconds of removal which makes it difficult to drain the battery. Overall, I am fairly happy with it so far."
acura,rdx,2007,Emile, 12/12/2006,Another Great Car from Acura,pos,"I've had the RDX for over a month, it is fun to drive.  It is very comfortable and comes with many standard otions.  I had an '04 MDX and I like this model much better. It has good fit and finish and the quality is excellent. It is very quick and the gas mileage is good.  It handles well on the open raod and is very responsive, like a sport model. "
acura,rdx,2007,wendy, 12/10/2006,Sooo Fun to Drive,pos,"I have had the RDX for two months and think it is a blast to drive.  I had an A4 1.8T and suffered through turbo lag.  There is no lag whatsoever.  This car (it's not really an SUV) really goes!  The trade-off is fuel economy.  Based on the computer, it seems like a 1/2 gallon is used each time I accelerate rapidly.  I am getting 22-23 highway and 11-13 in city. Very comfortable seats.  Audio, navigation, XM and traffic is fun but there is so much functionality it can be distracting while driving at first. Read the manual! I am disappointed in the wind noise from the driver side door at highway speeds.  Hard to detect this on test drives in urban areas.  It overshadows the stereo."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX_75, 01/07/2007,Get SUV,pos,Purchased this vehicle about one week ago and couldn't be more pleased.  The voice activated navigation and bluetooth with the technology package is awesome.  The fit and finish on this vehicle is some of the bese I have ever seen having owned Audi's and Mercedes in the past.
acura,rdx,2007,Grizzly, 01/13/2007,Great comfort,pos,"I purchased this car never having driven an Acura before, and I was sold from the minute I sat in the seat.  Comfortable, secure, and sporty.  The performance of the RDX greatly surpassed my expectation.  Far better than any of the competitors in its class.  And the technology features are easy to use and the voice recognition can do anything from find a location to turning on the A/C.  I would highly recommend the RDX to anyone wanting to purchase a small SUV with performance and technology."
acura,rdx,2007,Janice, 01/24/2007,Definite Improvement,pos,"We purchased this vehicle to replace the Honda Odyssey that I hated at 13 mpg.  I wanted the MDX but couldn't get into that one at the time - should have tried.  Anyway, this one has much better mpg, fun to drive, great looks, fairly easy entry/exit for ""fat"" mama.  Wish it had the power lift gate, auto on headlights (my Pontiac did).  And I wish I could pair my phone to it-- technology.  We love the Navi!  Wish our two Fits had that!"
acura,rdx,2007,Diego, 01/28/2007,Best car ever,pos,"Best car that I have had. And believe me, I've had every make out there. It's very fun to drive!! It's impossible to learn all the features it has. They just pop out and you think ""There's onother feature I did't know!!"" Its a great car, it's an SUV sports car."
acura,rdx,2007,SJN, 01/25/2007,Excellent SUV for the road warrior,pos,"We use the vehicle for work and travel. We love the tech package. HandsFree link is a favorite. The rear camera, SH-AWD is a must. Feels very safe to drive."
acura,rdx,2007,Mike, 02/04/2007,RDX,pos,"The most comfortable, fun car I've ever owned."
acura,rdx,2007,John, 02/06/2007,Awesome vehicle!,pos,"Our RDX is as solid as can be.  It has no problems handling grades. Matter of fact, it is tough to keep it from racing off.  The car has plenty of power, is very comfortable and has excellent ergonomic design.  It does eat up fuel, but I'll take its appetite over my old Maxima.  It truly is amazing, Acura is in a whole different class."
acura,rdx,2007,Stacie, 02/15/2007,Love It!,pos,"I purchased my RDX this week, the day before a large winter storm hit our area.  I thought the vehicle performed very well on the icy, snowy roads.  The roads are dry today, and I love the handling and feel.  The turbo engine has a lot of pep.  The interior and exterior are very sharp. I've gotten lots of compliments already from admirers who've noticed the vehicle. I also love all the things that Acura has made standard on the RDX that are options in vehicles from other automakers. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase and would recommend this vehicle to anyone interested in a smaller SUV that drives more like a sportscar."
acura,rdx,2007,CJ, 02/16/2007,The Best Ever!,pos,"This is our 3rd Acura & is the best and our favorite one to date!  This car is simply awesome!  The AWD in the snow and ice is amazing.  The features and comfort of this car are excellent.  This car is luxury, drives like a sports car and has the utility of a SUV."
acura,rdx,2007,Baldegl, 02/20/2007,Mileage no hassle,pos,Averaging almost 20 mpg on first tank including urban Chicago driving and expressways. Handling very much on par with an X-3 and feels a little quicker and certainly more opulently finished interior. The 4 cylinder is surprisingly responsive. Feels faster on than the 2005 RL we traded even though comparable weights.
acura,rdx,2007,acurardx2, 03/03/2007,super,pos,"Plain super, I love the vehicle. I was contemplating between fully loaded RAV4 and BMW X3. I am glad that I test drove RDX, within minutes I was certain that I was going to buy RDX.  Turbo engine gives great accelaration, which I like better than v6 of RAV4. You get a feel of road while driving this suv which is very much like x3. RDX definitely score big points on style (interior and exterior).  I have driven this car in lots of snow and icy conditions, Acura's SH AWD and Vehicle Stability Assistant provides super handling.  I love driving this so much that I kinda want to be on road all the time."
acura,rdx,2007,Tom's RDX, 03/14/2007,Fun on wheels,pos,"Love this SUV/Car. Technology packed in the car for the price is outstanding. Stereo is best I've ever heard in a car. Incredible handling in the snow. 4000+ miles now, and each mile makes me happier I purchased the RDX. Drives like a sports car, without the cramped seats and crappy ride."
acura,rdx,2007,Jappi, 03/23/2007,Black thunder!,pos,"Honestly, I was never even considering a Japanese SUV until I took the RDX for a test spin. I love the zero to 60 in 6.8 secs, SH-AWD (it truly works!), no-lag turbo. The RDX V4 Turbo is as good as any V6 guzzler SUV you see in the market, even better in some sense. And not to mention, the tech features are just fabulous. Everything works great. The RDX handles way better than BMW X3. And come on, the luxury and reliability of Acura can never be beat. The pricing is too good as well. And the best thing, the car is going to tell me when it needs servicing. Until then, I dont even need to take it to the service guys. How cool is that?! Go Acura!"
acura,rdx,2007,Michael, 03/07/2007,Perfection,pos,"I am a young single male who works hard and plays hard. From what I have read that was the market segment Acura was hoping to target. They definitely hit the nail on the head with the RDX. This car fits my lifestyle perfectly. Whether it's a night out on the town with friends, a business luncheon, or a snowboarding trip up north, the RDX handles all of my needs flawlessly. I was concerned about how fun it would be to drive since I was coming from a sports car, but boy was I wrong. This car is such a treat to drive, it doesn't matter where you are going. It's fun, comfortable, and has great features. This is one of the first cars I have owned that doesn't have a single rattle or squeak."
acura,rdx,2007,steve v, 04/02/2007,Finally a Fun to Drive SUV,pos,"I was so hesitant to look at the RDX after I read all of the reviews about it being too bumpy of a ride with lots of wind noise. Coming from a truck based sport utility, this car screams luxury and comfort. The console is amazing and offers every amenity you can think of plus all of the gee-whiz gadgetry that appeal to the 30-something market. The stereo system is the best out there as well as the navigation package. The car handles the road like a sports car and fields the bumps just fine with minimal wind noise. If you are looking for a pillowy ride to tote your kids around this isnt it. You just need to drive it for yourself to find out if it is a fit for you and your family."
acura,rdx,2007,kenjr, 04/08/2007,Very Nice Vehicle,pos,"Drove home with the RDX w/Tech a few days ago and am absolutely loving this vehicle.  The common complaints are gas mileage and bumpy ride but those are VERY easy to overlook with all of the other great features of this vehicle.  The ride isn't THAT bumpy, but it certainly is a little rough.  Freeway driving is very nice and I'm averaging about 18-19 on my first tank of gas with a good mix of city/frwy.  My wife will probably get better MPG as she doesn't have a lead foot like I do.  Overall, great value - tech package is amazing... best on the market (and I'm a geek) without question. Build quality is solid with a lot of little cool features."
acura,rdx,2007,John K., 03/30/2007,Awesome Crossover !,pos,"This Crossover SUV is a blast to drive. I think its the best value in its class.  This was designed to compete with BMW's X3 and does so quite nicely.  Similarly equipped you would have to spend about $8,000 more if you opted for the BMW.  The Acura has a well crafted interior that is  is full of luxury.  The handling is extremely sporty, it drives a lot like a sedan with all the great features of having a SUV. I have noticed some negative reviews regarding gas mileage, feeling bumps etc...  It seems to me those people don't have common sense.  If you want a crossover with sports car like handling and performance, you will give up some gas mileage and cushyness on the road.   "
acura,rdx,2007,Lori, 04/10/2007,Great Value,pos,"I bought this car 4 months ago and love it!  Quality materials and construction inside and out.  This car feels more luxurious than many of the higher priced cars I drove and has so many more features when you add the Tech Package (totally worth the added expense, especially if you spend a lot of time on the road).  I use the Bluetooth, the voice commands, and the Navi-traffic on every trip.  Gas mileage could be better. My overall MPG (for 6000 miles) is 22.5.  Not great when I compare it to my old Honda CRV, but is still better than I expected.  To sum it up, if gas mileage is your primary concern, stick with the CRV or go to a sedan.  Otherwise, you really can't go wrong with the RDX."
acura,rdx,2007,Sutter A., 04/20/2007,"Once to get in, you will never get out!",pos,"Really, this SUV is just too cool. Buy it with the tech package. Its rival crossovers (I test drove Mazda CX7, BMW X3, Ford Fusion, GMC Arcadia) totally pale in comparison. This SUV is both performance-rich and super techy. Beware! With the sport suspension and handling, it does not drive like an old man's Cadillac. Turbo kicks in real nice. Even the base version is fully loaded - moon roof, leather, etc. For an equivalent version, other luxury brands charge you a fortune. Nobody else offers all these features in one car, and for the price. Overall, it's the best ""bang for the buck"" in its category.  Good job Acura!"
acura,rdx,2007,Albert, 05/01/2007,Acura RDX is an awesome small SUV,pos,"RDX is quick and nimble, acceleration feels like v6, it corners like it's on rails, suspension is nice & stiff, and it  has a great turning radius.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Trailman, 05/03/2007,Good Vehicle,pos,Very happy with it so far. My gas mileage has not been as bad as some others report: 17 mpg.
acura,rdx,2007,I love Acura, 04/04/2007,Acura has done it again!,pos,"I can't say enough about the new RDX! I absolutely love this vehicle!  This is my 4th Acura and they keep getting better.  Everyone interested in an SUV should put this on their list!  Once they drive it, they won't be looking anywhere else!"
acura,rdx,2007,Rob, 04/14/2007,Change is Good!,pos,"After driving a large SUV for the last four years, I am thrilled to be behind the wheel of a new RDX!  I am thoroughly enjoying the superb handling as well as all of the amenities that come standard and those that are part of the tech package.  For the extra cost, the navigation and voice command functions are easy to grasp and make the entire driving experience even more exciting.  As a father who runs many errands with my son, I am pleased with the size of the RDX as it has plenty of interior room and is comfortable for back seat adults as well.  Thus far, there is nothing about the RDX that I do not like.  Definitely a welcomed change!"
acura,rdx,2007,Greenboy, 05/03/2007,"Whew, So happy to have gotten it.",pos,"Just got the car last weekend and am having a great time.  This car is quick and responsive yet has all the versatility I need.  I go over a mountain/hill in Berkeley/Oakland every day and it is a joy to drive through the woods, taking curves and downshifting manually on the downhills.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Mark, 04/18/2007,What a blast!,pos,"I drove all the competitors prior to this purchase.  This vehicle truly screams ""fun to drive"".  I almost bought an Infiniti FX35 but could not get over the awesome tech package in the RDX at this price.  This crossover SUV almost handles as well as my BMW 330xi.  It has great acceleration.  In fact if you floor it expect to get pinned to your seat.  So far the reliability is 100% better than the Grand Cherokee that it replaced.  I cannot help myself from accelerating hard in corners and feeling this SUV handle like a sports sedan. Complaints about poor fuel economy and a  harsh ride should be put in perspective.  This is meant to be a sporty crossover and it totally meets the criteria."
acura,rdx,2007,dfjcu1979, 04/18/2007,Great SUV!,pos,"I just bought my RDX a week ago and love it thus far.  I originally thought I was going to buy an MDX but after driving both, I prefered the way the RDX handled and I do not need the extra room that the MDX has.  Mileage is ok, been getting an overall average of 19 mpg, this should improve after a couple thousand miles.  I was concerned about going to a 4 cylinder from my 06 TL.  This vehicle has plenty pickup and absolutely no turbo lag.  The engine is rather quiet too from the inside, as opposed to how noisy it is on the TSX.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Vivian, 05/14/2007,Best in its class,pos,"Test drove the BMW X3, Lexus RX 350 and the RDX is the best. It's the class leading in acceleration, braking and handling. It's just like a sport sedan and I like it better than my 2006 IS 250 (much faster....^_^). Also, the finish and materials are much better than X3 and even better than Lexus. We love the RDX and my wife is thinking to trade in her 2006 IS 250 for another RDX with tech package. It's our first Acura. I highly recommend people test drive the RDX before you make decision."
acura,rdx,2007,Kathy, 05/19/2007,Too much fun!,pos,"After six weeks of my son and I driving and researching all types of SUVs, I narrowed it down to the RDX and still enjoy every minute in it. I don't want to go to work in the morning, I want to keep going! This definitely has a sporty ride, but the handling in snow and rain is great. The controls are very easy to use, yet I am still getting use to the nav. I don't need to use it a lot, but it has been great when needed. The sound system is awesome. Still looking for some DVD-A discs of the bands I like. The size of the center console is great and I like that it locks."
acura,rdx,2007,rdx, 05/26/2007,"After 18,000 miles and 10 months",neu,"Throughout 18,000 miles of 60% city and 40% highway driving, gas mileage is 17.9 miles/gallon. Did not have any major problem other then air vent warranty fix. However, I have minor rattle and ticking noise problem. Oil change $70 x 2. Rear differential fluid $100 at 15,000 miles service. Not a comfortable ride if one is seeking an ordinary SUV ride. Some improvements on coming year (08 model) would make this car better and outstanding."
acura,rdx,2007,cnmec, 06/06/2007,My RDX,pos,"The turbo is peppy, but takes a second to kick in.  The road noise is a bit more than I would like and it is a stiff ride, which some people don't like. "
acura,rdx,2007,acurafan, 06/17/2007,Beautiful!!,pos,"Just purchased the Acura RDX with Tech Package. The moment I drove it off the lot, I knew I had made the right choice. Beautiful, smooth but powerful engine, excellent handling for an SUV and quick pickup make this a great ride. The tech package is worth it, the voice recognition rocks and you rarely need to touch any of the menu buttons so long as you know the voice commands. Plenty of room in the back seats and they fold down giving even more room. Great, sturdy car!"
acura,rdx,2007,T. Gray, 06/14/2007,2007 Acura RDX w/ Technology Package,pos,"The is my first ownership of an SUV, a term I generally despise being somewhat of a car snob. I've owned Acura sedans before, the last being a 2004 TL, so I was mildly skeptical that the RDX could provide the comfort and performance of the TL.  This vehicle redefines for me the term sport ute.  The straight line performance, particularly while using the paddle shifters, is the equal of the more powerful V6 TL once you get used to the mild turbo lag on initial throttle tip in.  And the RDX's handling actually outperforms the TL on my favorite two-lane country roads and city round-abouts.      "
acura,rdx,2007,swiftfootedperseus, 06/18/2007,Exactly Right,pos,"I really wanted something that had some get-up-and-go and was fun to drive in the mountains.  This really fills the bill.  Yes, the ride is stiff, but it's nearly as much fun to drive as my wife's Mini Cooper, which is saying a lot.  In addition, it's got one of the best sound systems I've heard. Don't worry about the road noise."
acura,rdx,2007,remke44, 08/01/2007,Very few flaws,pos,"The RDX is a great small SUV.  I've had mine almost a year and I love the ride, handling, and sleek interior.  The interior and cargo space are much larger than the exterior of the car would indicate. The biggest drawback is the poor gas mileage.  I drive 80% in the city and 20% on the highway and I've only averaged 15 MPG.  That's pretty bad for a small SUV.  Other small annoyances -- the seat belts don't fit snug and rattle; the front seats should slide back further to increase front leg room. Cheaper than the BMW X3 and more luxurious and sportier than the RAV4 or CRV."
acura,rdx,2007,Matt, 08/07/2007,Very impressed overall..,pos,"Obviously I bought the RDX, so I must like it. I needed a smaller SUV than the MDX, but didn't want to sacrifice on features, performance, materials, and quality. Nothing else provided this mix for the money. I initially looked at the CRV, but was very disappointed in the materials and options. I was very impressed with the interior of the RDX. Excellent materials, a mind-blowing stereo, and very comfortable seats. The navigation is top notch, and some German car makers should take notes. So many techie toys too! And this thing handles like a dream. The SH-AWD from the RL is used, and whoa it's amazing. A bit of tire noise, and a bit of turbo lag are my only small gripes."
acura,rdx,2007,judy , 08/11/2007,RDX,pos,I love driving this car.  It rides smoothly and it feels luxurious.  The only thing I really hate is having to fill up the tank so often and having to pay so much because I can only use premium.
acura,rdx,2007,Carey, 09/21/2007,2007 Acura RDX: My Experience,pos,"My use of the car is limited to a 10 round trip commute to the office 5 days a week and about 150 miles of driving over the weekend.  The car drives wonderfully and has great acceleration.  Highway use is phenomenal.  Extremely comfortable back support in the driver's seat which comes in handy for my bad back.  Two gripes:  first is the poor gas mileage (18-19 city driving is disappointing (but what did I expect when I bought a car with turbo, right?)) and the CD player isn't performing well.  Still, all in all, it's very fun to drive and sharp-looking."
acura,rdx,2007,UTRDX, 10/05/2007,New To Me But So Far Impressed,pos,"I just recently purchased a preowned RDX with about 10000 miles on it.  I am really enjoying this car.  I am getting about 25 mpg on the highway and about 19 in city.  Overall this car seems very good, not at all underpowered, previous car was a sedan powered by V6 and this little SUV blows it out of the water. The interior is very confortable (no wood trim is a plus for me as I think it looks tacky).  I am hoping that the car is as reliable as other honda cars and am looking forward to updating when I get a few more miles under my belt."
acura,rdx,2007,FitnessCC, 10/06/2007,Most Fun in an SUV!,pos,"This vehicle is incredibly fun to drive.  I traded up from a TSX and the RDX actually handles/drives better!  The SH-AWD system is amazing: I feel glued to the road, no matter how hard I push the RDX.  Acceleration is great, and fuel mileage (for me) has been adequate (21 mpg) - not great, but decent for a SUV with this kind of acceleration.  The interior is wonderful - comfortable, tasteful, high-tech, full of useful information.  Awesome stereo system.  The nav system is very user friendly, if a little outdated in its database - but I absolutely love the XM live traffic display, which saves me time every day.  Great vehicle!"
acura,rdx,2007,CAS, 10/08/2007,Had questions initially,pos,"Had initial questions primarily due to problems with bluetooth, poor gas mileage and limited carrying capacity.  But now after several trips and three defective cell phones, believe I made the right choice in the RDX.  Gas mileage on last trip was over 24 mpg, seems to improve with each trip. City is routinely 17 mpg.  4th cell phone was the charm, bluetooth now works flawlessly.  Love the hard rear deck when using as a sedan, and sport handling is terrific.  Wife's Infiniti M35 screen graphics for navigation and rear camera is sharper and clearer, but after looking at several competitors, all have some compromises, but like RDX the best.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Lainey, 06/02/2007,Great ride,pos,"I've been looking for a car that had everything I wanted in a size I wanted.  The technology package has everything I was looking for.  There are a few things missing, but they weren't deal breakers.  The navigation is easy to use and the bluetooth is superb. The seats are comfortable and the a/c blows cold (important in the desert).  This car has good pick-up and has a great ride. "
acura,rdx,2007,Bish, 06/15/2007,An SUV with a High FTD Factor,pos,"The best thing about this vehicle is its high fun-to-drive factor. I have owned 3 VW GTIs because I loved the combination of practical, usable room and sports car handling and acceleration. I never though I could find it in a family car, much less an SUV. The ride may be a bit firm for some, but one feels noticably relaxed even after a long trip. The Tech package is worth every penny. The nav system and stereo are outstanding. The main drawback is gas mileage. I can't get much over 17 in the city and 21 on the highway. But, take a look out there, other than the RX 400h ($55K !!), this combination of FTD factor, room and tech can't be found with 20+ mpg!"
acura,rdx,2007,Lainey, 06/13/2007,Fun to Drive,pos,"I have had this CUV for about 3 weeks and driving has never been this fun!  This car has the technology I've been wanting.  I was rather surprised to find out it doesn't have automatic headlights, all my cars have had those for years.  The ride is very sporty.  As one who had been driving 6 & 8 cyl cars I was leery of the 4cyl turbo, but it has the pep needed to get me where I want to go.  Gas mileage isn't great but I knew that going in and it's better than the car I had been driving so I'm not complaining.  There are things missing but obviously it didn't dissuade me because I bought one!"
acura,rdx,2007,Disappointed Owner, 07/15/2007,Big disappointment,neu,"I thought I could get sport and utility in one vehicle, and be happy, but I was wrong. I find myself disappointed when I want to drive aggressively. Off the line acceleration is poor. You feel like you are anxiously waiting for the vehicle to realize you want it to go. The transmission often seems to be in too high of a gear and the paddle shifters are an absolute joke. The brakes also do not inspire confidence and you can still tell that you are driving an SUV. From a utility standpoint I am disappointed with the ride, comfort of the front seats, and leg room. I can't find a comfortable driving position and actually get sore on trips longer than 20 minutes. Overall I wish I could return it."
acura,rdx,2007,Henry, 07/29/2007,A great blend of car and SUV,pos,I always get a consistent 21 mpg all around. The seats are best in class. Go ahead and try all other makes - none compare. Ride is stiff - thats the price you pay for handling. 
acura,rdx,2007,Spoiled, 08/29/2007,Hands down winner!,pos,"I drove 5 other smaller sized SUVs, the BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Nissan and Infiniti.  None could even come close to the features for the money in the RDX.  Envy of everyone at work.  So much fun to drive it makes me wish I had a longer commute to work.  Even with gas prices the way they are I find myself looking for excuses to drive somewhere.  It rains a lot here and the SH AWD is very noticibly helpful in those conditions.  This vehicle is fun, safe and a great value.  Would recommend it to anyone."
acura,rdx,2007,lrpba300, 10/01/2007,RDX is the best!,pos,"This SUV/CUV is the best all around vehicle I've ever owned! It has it all. It has a great interior, comfortable seats, great handling (like a sports car!), ride is firm, but nice, solid build, room to haul stuff, paddle shifters, great looks. I'm very happy and have had many vehicles before due to leases for work, but I bought this one and couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2007,RDX Fan, 05/19/2007,Nice But Lacks Some Acura Tradition,pos,"I ordered the RDX in May and received it in Sep 06 and it was worth the wait, mostly.  Great handling and performance, sporty and comfortable around every corner & on the highway.  Acura did a good job bringing the RDX to this class of SUV.  But I do wonder why Acura went away from what worked in the MDX family (I left the MDX to come to the RDX).  With all the good there are some things missing (see Suggested Improvements).  Some toys just detract from the experience and others should have carried over from the MDX.  Maybe they should have actually asked Acura drivers what they liked before building something with so many less functional add-ons."
acura,rdx,2007,Alex M., 05/23/2007,A definite disappointment!!,neu,"I traded an '03 MDX for this vehicle because I'm single, have no need for a large SUV, and have been very happy with Acura (my 4th Honda product). This vehicle has been a big letdown compared to my MDX. The nimbleness, size and manueverabilty (and handling) are excellent, and what I was looking for, but the 4 cylinder turbo engine is terrible and is really beginning to wear down on me. There is a good amount of turbo lag making it feel sluggish from a start, and the the engine is noisy even when accelerating moderately!! The fuel economy is simply horrendous for a small 4-banger SUV (same as my 7-passenger MDX with a 3.5L V6!!). I will likely end up trading it for something with a decent V6."
acura,rdx,2007,Luis, 06/12/2007,WOW!!!,pos,I traded in my 2004 Nissan Murano SE. I test drove the RDX with the tech package and fell in love. This SUV handles better than most sports cars. The SH-AWD is great especially in inclement weather. Gas mileage in ok but I have a lead foot.
acura,rdx,2007,jfc, 06/21/2007,Perfect mix,pos,"Acceleration, handling, comfort and utility.  Limited capacity is not a surprise based on the size.  20 mpg mixed driving - aggressive at times but not needless (like racing to a stop light).  Stiff ride took a whole week to get used to and one more to love."
acura,rdx,2007,wsdyer, 07/18/2007,I like it.,pos,"Small enough to get around the beltway nasty traffic yet, big enough to allow you to see what's up ahead.  The tech package is cool if your company allows you to synch your blackberry with your car - mine doesn't - ostensibly for security reasons.  Even if the company doesn't, it's worth it to get your own phone and just ignore theirs when it rings.  She drives like a dream and looks very stylish.  The only thing I don't like about her is really crappy gas mileage.  Even when I am on the highway I get no more than 21 or 22 MPG.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Paul, 07/20/2007,Still Needs Tweaking,pos,We liked the car at first sight. It is a blast to drive and the turbo kicks in quickly. The technology model is the way to go.  Great sound system! Overall visibility is excellent!
acura,rdx,2007,RDXer, 07/27/2007,Can't go wrong,pos,"The RDX is the complete package for the new category of CUVs. Compared to the X3 (way overpriced) and its cheaper counterpart the CX-7, the RDX is hands down the winner with better handling, vtech engine, non existent turbo lag, and Acura quality and reliability that competitors dream of."
acura,rdx,2007,Garg, 09/25/2007,Excellent SUV,pos,"I love the F1 system, drives smoothly, love the interiors, blue light is amazing. GPS is awesome. Fuel economy is bit poor but justified when you buy RDX."
acura,rdx,2007,kcosta, 10/12/2007,Love this vehicle,pos,"My husband needed a new car for work to haul people around. This vehicle is what we were looking for. It has enough luxury to impress but is still not over the top. Great performance. Although it is small, it is spacious inside. After getting used to a WRX we wanted something that did not lack in the performance department but didn't break the bank. This vehicle is perfect."
acura,rdx,2007,CD, 10/19/2007,Engine troubles are a surprise,pos,"I love everything about this car except that I have been into the shop with engine troubles about every 2-3 weeks.  The engine will suddenly rev uncontrollably and the turbo has stopped working 3 times.  This car is downright dangerous to drive without the turbo support to get you moving.  The dealer hasn't been able to figure out what is wrong yet -- just keeps erasing the codes which make the problems go away for a short while.  Sadly, it's time for a trade-in after only 5 months.  So much for Acura quality, which is one of the main reasons I traded in my Saab 9-5 for this."
acura,rdx,2007,dk168, 10/25/2007,Fun to drive but not impressed!,pos,"Have had the car for almost a year now. Not impressed by Acuras quality. Dashboard started to rattle after four months of having the car; now is getting worse, both corners rattle at cooler temperature. Even the sunroof rattles during bumpy road. Turbo lag is definitely noticeable at low RPM with A/C on.  I have to put the gear in the Sport mode to minimize the turbo lag when traffic is in a stop-and-go condition; this seems to help. Ride is a little stiff (comments given by everyone who had ridden in my car). Poor gas mileage.  I am getting averaged 18 MPG with roughly 60% hwy and 40% surface street driving.  Okay, with all the negatives mentioned, I must say the car is a fun car to drive."
acura,rdx,2007,Henry FL1, 12/01/2007,Great Ride,pos,"Other than gas mileage, it's a fun car to drive. Notice how I said ""car"" - it does not drive like a SUV at all. I considered the Honda CRV loaded, but it lacked some-like no useable armrest etc."
acura,rdx,2007,JimTex, 11/19/2007,Not for the daily commuter,pos,"We bought this car knowing that fuel mileage was not its strong point, but have averaged about 19 mpg (mostly city).  My wife loves this vehicle because it is incredibly responsive and handles as well as the BMW we traded in.  The seating position is nice and high, but without the huge vehicle to go along with it."
acura,rdx,2007,dpo, 04/24/2008,"Good car, poor storage space and MPG",pos,"The RDX performs well and is clearly well made.  It drives like a sedan.  It is a very good car for a single person, but storage space for families on trips is relatively poor, especially given only 20 mpg.  Bringing a stroller severely limits baggage space.  The reality is that if you are going to get poor gas mileage, you might as well buy a larger SUV.  My 4-Runner gets about 20 to 22 mpg and has far more space.   Seats are very comfortable as long as the ride is on a smooth road.  Bumps are unpleasant for back seat passengers.  Steering is tight and car handles nicely.  "
acura,rdx,2007,Zach, 08/13/2020,I must of had bad luck,neg,"I bought mine used with 100,000 so it could be that just the previous owner didn't maintain it. It was a pretty sad ending for me. At first i loved it infact i still have not found a car that has such comfortable driver seat. From the armrest on the door to the adjustability of the steering wheel it was just so well designed. The trubo flet great! It couldn't through you back in your seat but it was a gradual and nice acceleration. This crossover felt like more of a gate way to a sport car notwithstanding though it looks like a minny van. Gas mileage as expected didnt get much better than 24 mpg but for a 2007 not bad. My main complaint is that once i got a sensor it was impossible to fix. The o2 sensor went out and then everything went out spent about 2,000 to repair in one month but eventually i just had to let go"
acura,rdx,2008,Drew Engstrom, 08/07/2015,Great if you can live with the compromises,pos,"The RDX is sports sedan masquerading as a luxury SUV. Cornering and acceleration? Great. Cushioned, quiet ride? Nope. I chose the RDX because there are many SUV and truck drivers where I live and I wanted to sit a little bit higher than I would in a sedan - and I am completely sold on Honda/Acura reliability and quality. 

Quality and reliability have been excellent and the driving position is comfortable with excellent visibility; my advice to prospective buyers would be to simply understand the trade-offs:

1) The turbocharged 4 cylinder is very responsive and fun to drive - but, don't expect to get much more than 16 MPG when you're zipping around town, or about 23 MPG when cruising on the highway.

2) The taut suspension makes for great handling - but, don't expect a plush, Toyota-ish ride quality; you will feel and hear road imperfections.

3) The car is very nimble and comfortable for an SUV - but remember, this is a smaller SUV and it really isn't any roomier than a smaller sedan (think Acura TSX)

Conclusion; if you like the Acura feel (tight suspension, cornering on rails) and you want something with some power, this is as good a combination of value and quality as you can get in a small SUV.

acura,rdx,2008,mike, 07/17/2015,Overall We Love This Car,pos,"In the year 2015, had to replace our 2005 CRV which we loved, because of a hit and run that left our car trashed. We were looking at simply getting another CRV, but stumbled across a 2010 RDX at a dealer. We took it for a drive and fell in love. We didn't quite like the look of the 2010 model (fog lights are a little ""pronounced"" for our taste, so out of curiosity we looked and found a 2008 model with 59k miles that was a new arrival at a local dealer. Took it out for a drive, and loved it even more than the 2010 model we had driven earlier.  To be sure, we subsequently tried a few other CRVs (2005, 2010, 2012) but by that time I think we were just too smitten with the RDX and never looked back. We got the RDX for $15k and are sooooo happy about it. (cheaper than any CRVs we saw, including a 2005 model that would have essentially replaced the one we lost, but was more expensive than this 2008 RDX.  

A couple things that any buyer should be aware of especially in 2015: (1) Mileage. We just took a road trip and got 23 mpg, which is about what it was advertised at (actually slightly better).  You have to be on top of RPMs, use of AC, buying gas at Costco, and other things if you want to keep your costs and gas use down - and those are all things we are good with doing. (2) We had a little rattling in the car when we got it. After a long search we found it wasn't mechanical, but rather the latch for back seat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS7CgzsiRs&feature=youtu.be), which is now totally silent thanks to electrical tape!  That's pretty much it so far, and granted it's only been a month since we bought the car, but it is a 2008 model and no other red flags (just had it inspected too).

So many good things for us. The cabin is like a dream after the CRV. Again we loved our CRV but didn't realize how much better it could be with a car like an RDX. Driving it feels like we got bumped from coach to first class. Don't know what rear passenger  seats feel like, but front are awesome with leather, memory seats, amazing stereo, storage, Dual climate setting. Dash is real easy to look at and find what you need. We don't have the Tech model but don't seem to be complaining either. And as much as cabin rocks, the engine is amazing. 240hp turbo, whoa. So fun to drive!! That might have been the kicker for us, I'm pretty sure it sealed the deal for my wife, I'll never forget her face when she turned her first corner - she was like ""oh yeah, I love this car."" Separate from that, good fold-down seats in back to make the entire rear a flat surface, and our model is black with tinted windows, so lord it is sexy!

If you can keep on top of gas use and budgeting, I think this car is great. I realize it's early for us but coupled with our inspection by our trusted mechanic and plans to get regular maintenance checks, we hope to have many years of RDX fun to come...

Update: After a few years of owning the car, if anything I would bump up the rating. The RDX has held up extremely well, especially considering it is a 2008 model, 10 years old! We are close to 100k miles, but it's still pretty much running the same as we bought it. We have been good about service appointments based on the warnings we get from cars, and aside from normal things for older cards - like replacing brake pads - it has been solid. We have taken countless road trips which this car is really the best for, but also use it for day-to-day use and it's been great all around. Realize the age might catch up to us soon, but for now we are happy to continue enjoying the ride!
"
acura,rdx,2008,Mark, 03/26/2016,Love my RDX,pos,"The handling, acceleration and look of this car is unmatched.. Love the interior and leather seats as well. The only negative is the turbo requires hi octane and the gas mileage is a little disappointing. However, with a turbo you can't have your cake and eat it too.. Overall, I believe it's the best small SUV on the market..including the BMW..
"
acura,rdx,2008,Cone, 08/21/2017,Love it! Just can't afford it when things break.,pos,"I bought this used 6 years ago, from a known and trusted private seller. At first I loved everything except the cost of fuel. It takes Premium, and gulps it at about 19 miles/gallon on average. I love the handling, energy, road feel, visibility... it is a great ride and I love driving it. Its great safety ratings made my insurance stay the same as the previous car, which was worth 10% of what the R cost me. Here's the problem. Since 90,000 miles, stuff started to break. Notably, the A/C compressor... between $900-$1100 to replace. I had to do an inner tie rod and front struts. Most recently, the alternator. There are things gone weird with some of the technology, such as the backup sensor system and the driver memory and the map display. Recently, when the Climate Control is on Auto in hot weather, the passenger side dashboard vents have been randomly blowing HOT air instead of air conditioned cool air such as the other vents properly have. Messing around with different settings will usually help us to work around the problem. Like most intermittent problems, I suspect this will be impossible to troubleshoot and address unless it becomes constant. My guess about the technology is that 2008 was an early year in the introduction of some of this stuff. Finally, sad to say, this was my first non-Japanese-made Acura, and its fit and finish are just not as good as the two Integras I had that were actually built in Japan. I still do like this car, though, and will keep it for as long as I can.

acura,rdx,2008,flip110119, 01/30/2011,ACURA QUALITY,pos,"I have the 2008 RDX with Tech package - 33,000miles & it has delivered as expected. NO problems what so ever!! All that I have done so far is change the Trans fluid, rear differential fluid & Oil. I love the SUV from the performance to the comfort & utility. It's the perfect size for utility & still can parallel park in the city with no problems! I've seen a few reviewers complain about Gas Mileage but I haven't really experienced anything less than the 17/22 which Acura expects. I've been getting 19.6mpg in the city & 26.1mpg on the highway with the cruise control on at 70MPH. I keep the tire pressure at 40PSI & I drive with a roof rack. I'd buy this car again!!"
acura,rdx,2008,Medina Wood, 07/27/2016,Acura RDX,pos,"Had this car for 8 years and not once in shop.  Very reliable and stayed looking brand new after 8 years.  Very pleased with this purchase.
"
acura,rdx,2008,Stretch, 07/27/2010,The right car for me,pos,"I had an Accord, and wanted more cargo versatility. Drove several other small SUVs (Rogue, CX-7, EX-35), and the RDX was the obvious choice. The EX-35 was great, but just not enough room. The others were not comfortable enough, both in seat comfort and ride quality. The RDX does seem too stiff on city streets (my '98 Accord was smoother). But it has a solid feel, very smooth on the freeway, great acceleration, plenty of upscale features - basically a blast to drive. My wife can have her cushy Lexus. I prefer the sporty Acura."
acura,rdx,2008,ducky79, 02/14/2012,"60K, so far, so good",pos,"2008 RDX, 60K mileage, no problem so far.
I would say this is a very reliable car.
Pro: reliable, great handling, decent power
Con: rough ride, bad gas mileage
I believe it can run 3-5 more years."
acura,rdx,2008,Anonymous, 12/06/2010,It's just ok,pos,"I have been driving my RDX for 2 months now.  Interior is nice with heated leather seats, moonroof.  Not enough room in the back, my tall 9 year old won't be able to sit back there in a few years.  Gas mileage is awful.  20 mpg on average. Its a gas guzzler and you must buy premium gas. poor cargo room. My honda crv had double the cargo.  Nice pick up with the turbo acceleration.  But too much of a gas guzzler, can't wait to get rid of it.  Luxury vehicles are way over rated and not practical for the cost.  I suggest you shop around before buying a luxury car. Total waste of money just for transportation.   "
acura,rdx,2008,ledwinka, 07/17/2008,A Satisfied Owner,pos,"Worked as a vehicle test engineer for an European car company when I fell in love with the SH-AWD system on the RL. Got the RDX based in July of 2007. Handling is light and responsive for a car with this huge mass. Turning corners is a dream with the SH-AWD: it ate corners while driving down I-80 near Lake Tahoe, CA. Turbo lag is small compared to other turbo cars but you can hear them. Durability has been excellent. People all comment how pricey this car looks and become surprised at the price. Very comfortable seats. Love the relatively large width of the vehicle. Rear seat space is very large for people of two, even three. Lament that I did not get the nav system."
acura,rdx,2008,Jim R, 10/11/2008,A Great Compromise,pos,"Having spent a year and 13,000 miles with my RDX, I'm very pleased with the experience. After driving European sport sedans for the past 20 years, I wanted the utility, AWD, and taller view of a compact SUV.  However, I didn't want to give up the ""fun to drive"" nature of my previous vehicles.  The RDX delivers.  It's very quick.  And the ride is somewhat firm -- what I expected and wanted in a vehicle that enjoys attacking mountain curves.  Yet, to me the ride is by no means harsh.  The interior is well designed and fairly luxurious.  Acura reliability is a huge bonus -- I got to know the service techs far too well with my previous cars. "
acura,rdx,2008,Eilidh, 01/11/2008,Nearly as Fun as a Mini,pos,"When my cute mini cooper became a sled in the Boston winter, I reluctantly hunted for a small SUV. After much deliberation, decided on the Acura over the BMW X3 on cost and reliability. So glad I did - the sound system is superb, the build is quality, bikes fit in the back, the turbo makes pleasing whooshes and the acceleration is plenty for me. Its just as grin inducing as a mini - and no icy skidding. Negatives include instructions more mind boggling than physical chemistry textbooks and a voice recognition system that doesnt quite understand my UK English. However, I'm persevering to learn Honda-ese and confident we'll become friends. An excellent fun car in every way."
acura,rdx,2008,AcuraFan, 11/10/2007,WOW! Awesome compact SUV,pos,"I purchased this car about a month ago. What a great ride. It's Honda reliable, love the navigation system, very comfortable. This is also a VERY stylish car. No complaints, just suggestions. Good price range for a luxury crossover. From this car, I will likely drive Acuras for a long time."
acura,rdx,2008,Jeremy C, 11/25/2007,"In crossover segment, hard to beat",pos,"Faster and less expensive than the BMW X3, the Acura RDX is about as good as it gets in this segment.  It drives like a sports sedan and has plenty of storage.  If you're looking at the Murano, you should check out the RDX as well.  It's faster and a lot nicer, for only a few thousand dollars more.   The SH All Wheel Drive makes accelerating out of a corner nice as well.   Overall, I'd give it a 9.5 / 10.  "
acura,rdx,2008,twistlock, 12/17/2010,"40K and so far, so good",pos,"For the past couple of years my RDX has worked well - no warranty issues to date. In addition to city/ highway driving, I travel frequently to Lake Tahoe during the winter. The SH-AWD mated with winter tires keeps me truck'in along. Agree with other reviews that gas mileage is not the best when climbing the Sierra Nevada, but there is zero power loss (IMO) and I knew what to expect with a turbo-engine. "
acura,rdx,2008,RW, 05/07/2008,Learn about it first,pos,"Just bought my RDX and love to drive it.  Make sure you know what you are getting with the RDX - it is a sports car with stiff suspension and a firm ride so if you want a soft, ""never feel a bump"" ride then look elsewhere.  Went without the tech package - the $4k was too steep for me.  If you want the suv where sport meets luxury (and don't need that much cargo room), check it out.  "
acura,rdx,2008,MCK, 05/10/2008,"Fun, but expensive to operate",pos,"I traded my 2004 Expedition for a more efficient vehicle.  After 1400 miles of combined driving the computer indicates we averaged 14.7 MPG on expensive premium gas (required).  That is almost exactly the same mileage my big Expedition was obtaining on regular gas.  Needless to say, I am terribly disappointed.  On a positive note, the car is very comfortable (except, a lot of fun to drive, the technology package is amazing, the sound system is even more amazing.  The handling system in the car is a technological masterpiece.  But at 28.5 cents per mile for fuel (and rising), it sits peacefully in the garage while we drive our Civic and EOS around town.  "
acura,rdx,2008,angelina247, 05/13/2008,Fun RDX,pos,"I recently purchased the RDX with tech package. It is such a fun car to drive. It really has a quick pickup. I'm sometimes surprised how quickly I can take off if I'm not careful. I'm still learning how to work the voice controls and navigation screen. I really did my homework and went back and forth about whether I should lease or own. I've been leasing another make/model SUV for the past 7 years and finally decided the RDX would be worth owning. I comparison shopped the BMW X3 and Mercedes 350. The extras in the Acura for a lot less money were definitely a great incentive. Yet, I feel like the car is just as good if not better. My friends and family love it. I'm having a blast!"
acura,rdx,2008,andreadavis1, 04/14/2011,Rattle Trap,pos,"Cute, Fun car to drive. Rough ride. You can feel every bump and vibration in your head rest and seat. Isn't this supposed to be a luxury car? Stiff suspension causes things to rattle in the car. Not enough compartments. Just a big deep hole in the center console. Not large enough to fit carseats behind drivers seat."
acura,rdx,2008,Not happy in Florida, 07/11/2009,Did I just buy a lemon?,neg,"This RDX has been a nightmare. I have been in the shop 12 times since purchasing - 4 times for brakes alone. I've had them cleaned, replaced, rotors and then completely redone again. My memory module has gone, my seat has stopped working, blue tooth stopped working, bubbles on the hood from the paint, everything down to the footrest has fallen off. The rattle in the windows is terrible. Trying to get corporate to take back (WISH ME LUCK). The only good thing about this vehicle is the turbo."
acura,rdx,2008,disappoited, 02/25/2009,Brakes,neg,"I had the car for 8 months and drove wonderfully. Then, it snowed and my car had no brakes.  I would miss stop signs, traffic lights, etc.  3 wheels ago, I got in a car accidents because the brakes fail to operate. I had taken it to the dealership and complained but they indicated that some ppl have had issues but there isn't much they can do about it.  I filed a complaint at the corporate office but they brushed the matter off as if it was nothing.  Beware when purchasing the vehicle.  Not every car gets tested for snow, rain and gravel.  this is a matter of life and death, for you and others on the road with you. I am in the process of a law suit with Acura.  Good Luck to all!"
acura,rdx,2008,adam, 07/15/2008,Drive it right and get 26 MPG!,pos,"I love everything about the car. In the beginning I was disappointed in the gas mileage (~16MPG) but now that I've learned how to drive less aggressively, I'm getting 24 to 27 MPG in a mix of city/highway. The trick is to stay out of boost and under 70MPH on the highway, sure it takes patience but I've gone from 260 miles per tank to just under 400... that's a savings of about $150 per month based on the 1800 miles per month I drive."
acura,rdx,2008,lwfineny, 09/13/2007,2008 RDX,pos,"I've had the 2008 RDX for just a few days - very impressed so far. Handling and acceleration are great. I'm 6'5"" and have over 3 inches of space between my head and the roof - pretty amazing for a car with a moonroof. Initial fit and finish seem perfect. All in all, it's a lot of fun to drive."
acura,rdx,2008,Justin N., 05/12/2009,The BIGGEST MISTAKE of my life!!,neu,"Where do I start? Sure this vehicle is ""fun to drive"" and handles like a dream, and the interior is full of nifty features, like bluetooth, the Nav system and the phenomenal sound system. But that's about it!! Everything else about this vehicle is simply the worst. The turbo-4 is VERY NOISY when accelerating, and a good amount of ROAD NOISE enters the cabin. Very tiring on long highway drives!! FUEL ECONOMY is HORRENDOUS (about 15city/20hwy)- A huge disappointment for such a small 4-cylinder SUV!! (and for the most part I don't even drive very aggressively). I wish I could just return it and get something else!!"
acura,rdx,2008,RDX'er, 05/31/2008,For the Most Part -- Happy Owner,pos,"The style, speed, handling, AWD aspects are great.  The fuel economy could be better but is improving as the miles drive increases.  Dealer did have to replace the left front brake caliper due to a rattle noise but dealer assured me it was a new, factory replacement part not rebuilt.  Would be nice if it had auto on/off headlights and if the air conditioning ""auto"" function would always work with the recirculating button engaged -- living in the city you have to pretty much keep the recir button on all the time.  "
acura,rdx,2008,Satisfied Owner, 06/19/2008,Right Choice For Me,pos,"Car is wonderful to drive.  Quick and nimble, quiet yet solid.  I purchased the RDX with Tech package and am glad I did so.  Nav system is great and the ELS Stereo system is impressive.  The drive is a sporty, stiffer drive which I prefer.  I now have 3,300 miles and in mixed driving I am averaging 23 mpg."
acura,rdx,2008,dep, 08/14/2008,Amazing SUV at an amazing price point,pos,"Wow!  For the money the RDX really delivers.  I think of it as a cross between the TL Type S and the MDX.  Power is ample and the turbo makes it fun.  Grip, hold, and road feel are spot on.  The RDX makes you feel like you are attached to the pavement with no chance to ever come loose.  Acura, as they tend to do, has really invested a LOT in the technology and engineering that you will never see. From the SH-AWD to the first of its kind dual stage turbo.  So far, we are really impressed with the RDX."
acura,rdx,2008,Bob La Salle, 08/14/2008,Awesome vehicle,pos,"I have about 2,500 miles on it now and I get about 19 mpg all city driving, 26 all highway, much better than the other reviews.  It helps fuel economy if you keep that turbo gauge needle pointing down at the bottom, but the power is there when you need it.  It is really fun to drive and just the right size; awesome stereo & interior electronics; sporty to drive & sporty/plush ride."
acura,rdx,2008,ray f, 08/26/2008,Puts a smile on my face when I drive,pos,"Just bought an RDX Tech package.  This is primarily a commuter vehicle and a second car, so I was debating about getting a sedan for the gas mileage.  I really like SUVs though, and this one is spot on the money -- fun to drive, higher ride height, good performance, decent space.  I had a BMW x3 and 3 series sedan, and I like this better than either of those cars.  Each time I drive it, I get a smile on my face (hearing the turbo whoosh is a blast).  I just wish it got a bit better mileage.  Previous cars also include an MDX (previous body style).  This is way better than that car in tightness, comfort, luxury, and technology."
acura,rdx,2008,pdxRDX, 12/04/2008,A wolf in sheep's clothing.,pos,"What a hoot this thing is to drive! Somehow the wizards at Acura have managed to put the soul of a sports car into an SUV.  Decent fuel economy (great for an SUV), comfortable interior, great looks, amazing acceleration, plenty of goodies in the base model.  Buy one NOW!"
acura,rdx,2008,Marty, 12/05/2008,Nice,pos,"I've had the RDX for about three months and have been very pleased.  I drove a Honda Pilot for 5 years and it did a great job of hauling kids, but driving it was kind of like driving a boat.  Not so with the RDX.  This little SUV handles better than my wife's TL but offers a lot more flexibility.  I'm getting about 20 mpg in mixed driving, which is about what I expected.  I could probably get better mileage if I kept the little red turbo needle pointing down more often, but where's the fun in that!  So far, a really nice car."
acura,rdx,2008,Danny B., 03/10/2009,Great SUV!,pos,"A great little SUV!  It outperforms my G35X in the harshest winter conditions and is more fun to drive.  My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it had a little more cargo space; but then I guess it would have been the MDX.  The interior is beautiful, the features and tech outstanding.  And I LOVE the XM Satellite radio!  A great car!  My wife loves it and I love driving it when she's not."
acura,rdx,2008,JJayB, 03/20/2009,"RDX after 27,000 miles",pos,"I test drove every car in its class before I decided to buy the RDX.  I wanted something smaller than the gas guzzling Cayenne Turbo I was driving.  I wanted good visibility, good handling and reasonable fuel mileage and a vehicle I can put my golf clubs without folding down the back seats, which the Porsche, Audi, MB Ml all fail. The RDX has good acceleration and if you use the paddle shifter it beats just about any Suv at the stop light grand prix.   The handling leaves the X3 for dead.  Only negatives is the brakes.  Several high speed stops in succession will cause the pads to vibrate.  Dealer has replaced rotors and pads for free and admits it a problem.  Also, nav screen is not bright"
acura,rdx,2008,ALB, 04/01/2009,*Insert Smiley Face Here*,pos,"This car just makes me smile every time I get in it.  Roomy interior, comfortable seating, out-handles any small SUV I've ever driven.  If there were one car to completely embody my persona, this would be it-- spunky, sporty, with the perfect mix of practicality and luxury. "
acura,rdx,2008,Kdog, 04/13/2009,Qualtiy not good for price,neu,"I actually like this car, it handles well and has a lot of nice features. I have 23 months to go on my lease and will not purchase again. Too many rattles for a car at this price range. The gas mileage is horrible especially in the city, 17 mpg. I have taken it in twice and they seemed to fix one rattle but the other is still VERY audible. Overall somewhat disappointed. "
acura,rdx,2008,Mike H, 06/03/2009,"A good car from Acura, if it's for you",pos,"Buy this car with your eyes wide open and your expectations in line - you'll be happy. Reading the previous reviews for the RDX, I wonder whether some simply chose the wrong car. Don't buy a race horse, and then complain that it eats too much or can't pull a loaded wagon. This turbocharged engine has its quirks, but drive it right and you'll be rewarded with decent mileage and good acceleration. About 21-22 if driven moderately. Is it noisy?  A slight growl when floored. How about road noise? Depends on the road. Texas chip-and-seal roads get a little tiresome, but interstates are pretty quiet, and low-to-moderate speed roads are no problem. For me it's the right car - I'm happy."
acura,rdx,2008,sfduckie, 01/03/2008,I love this car!!,pos,"I've never owned an Acura before but I'm now a huge fan! The RDX is fun to drive, has great visibility, and the base model comes with absolutely everything you'd want (CD, bluetooth, MP3 hookup, XM radio free for 3 months, moonroof, seat warmers, etc). Also, the driver interface (at least on the base model) is intuitive and uncluttered. It feels like they really have the driver in mind. I highly recommend this car!  I'm so happy I bought it!"
acura,rdx,2008,Brenda Rodrigues, 01/09/2008,Awesome vehicle!!!,pos,"This is a great SUV! I received this SUV after totaling my 2002 dodge neon.  I was telling my husband how much I loved the MDX but not just any MDX. It had to be the older model because I was no fan of the rounded backs.  After a wise car salesman convinced me that I could get a 2008 RDX for the price of a used MDX with nearly 30-50 thousand miles it was no surprised I rushed to take the RDX for a test drive.  After the test drive I was sold.  We visited that dealership more than my in laws literally.  After a few weeks of debating, on 12/15/07 my husband purchased me the 2008 tech RDX.  I have put well over a thousand miles on it and I have had it less than a month.  It is a joy to drive!"
acura,rdx,2008,RDXLover, 01/19/2008,Love My RDX,pos,"Love my new RDX.  It's fun to drive and has all the bells and whistles that I was looking for.  Tech Package is a must especially if you like gadgets.  Handsfree bluetooth works great.  Very easy to to use and program.  Nav system is also very easy to use, easy to use voice commands.  Much better than my Camry bluetooth and nav"
acura,rdx,2008,Erik B., 11/28/2010,All Around Well Built,pos,"This is the first car in the luxury category that I considered buying. I own all Honda products. Pros: comfortable drivers seat, thrill to drive, rock solid reliability, Maintenance Minder system, sports car handling Cons: cheap aluminum accents, turbo lag, slightly cramped back seat, navigation should be touchscreen (selector knob is cumbersome, stock tires wear quickly Overall, I do like this car. It was a dealership loaner with 17,000 miles on it. It lacks the refinement of the other cars in this class (BMW X3, LandRover LR3, etc.) but for the price you get all the options you could ever need. I will most likely opt for another Acura when purchasing my next vehicle. "
acura,rdx,2008,Marc, 02/05/2008,So much fun,pos,"Just picked up the RDX 2 weeks ago and love it so far. My fiancée wanted an SUV, I wanted a sports car and we settled on the RDX. It has the body and space of an SUV, the interior of a luxury sedan, and drives like a sports car. I spent months looking at similar rides such as the BMW X3, Infiniti EX, Honda CRV, Rav 4 and this car had the most to offer in terms of features and was priced right in the middle of the pack. I couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2008,Drwarf, 02/12/2008,It's a Thrill Ride!,pos,"I finally own my dream vehicle. This RDX is beautiful. I picked the carbon bronze because not too many vehicles on the road are that color. The AWD is superb for handling in any situation. The turbocharged engine is very good for performance in passing and acceleration, better than some V6s. The interior is very comfortable with the adjustable driver seat and roomy enough second row. The satellite radio, 360-watt stereo system, dual climate, digital read-outs, and memory seats are all awesome for standard equipment. The fuel economy is respectable and premium gas is not a problem. This crossover is a 10 all the way around. Thanks Acura for another innovative, top-of-the-line vehicle."
acura,rdx,2008,Acura Owner, 02/12/2008,The All-Everything SUV,pos,"This SUV has it all.  All-wheel drive and a turbo and all the technology features you need (including a free 3-months subscription to XM-Radio and a back-up camera) in a true luxury package.  This car re-defines obsessive-compulsive traits up towards the maximum in terms of vehicle mechanical design and attention to interior fit and finish. On the road the vehicle is quiet, powerful and handles like a sports car on tight turns. The turbo has no noticeable lag and makes highway merging a breeze.  Once at cruising speed, the electronics enable you to easily check on all important vehicle functions without taking you hands off the steering wheel or your eyes off the road. "
acura,rdx,2008,Steve , 02/16/2008,RDX is a rocket!,pos,Love my RDX.  It has exceeded my expectations.  Last two cars have been BMWs 3 & 5 Series and will never go back.  Acura gives a great car for the money and very solid.  Much more reliable than the BMW and performs better.  Gas mileage isn't that bad (about 19) considering it's a 4000 lb car and it flies!
acura,rdx,2008,Dave Willson, 02/20/2008,2008 Acura RDX,pos,"What a great car.  Can't beat the bang for the buck.  The tech package is amazing, the acceleration is great and the car is useful and fun to drive.  The only two negatives are the gas mileage (I only get about 20 mpg) and the fact that the front passenger seat isn't power.  Otherwise, I can't complain about one thing!"
acura,rdx,2008,bballfreak150, 02/21/2008,"So happy, best decision I have ever made",pos,"Went from a 2001 Lexus IS 300 to a 2008 RDX.  Couldn't be happier, all of the things I loved about my IS with the room and comfort of an SUV.  It is actually faster than my old car and gets better gas mileage too. I'm averaging just over 22 mpg.  I love the AWD, turbo is amazing, and it's just really fun to drive.  If you are looking for a vehicle that is fast and fun to drive, gest good gas mileage, and have enough room to carry all of your gear then this is the perfect vehicle for you.  It was the best decision I have ever made."
acura,rdx,2008,Josh B, 03/01/2008,"Fun, fun, fun!",pos,"I've had my RDX one month now, and I absolutely love it! It really moves and sounds wonderful doing it. The interior is very inviting in taupe with better than expected room for four adults. The heated leather seats offer comfort and support in the turns, which is a good thing, because this machine loves the curves. Best car I've owned!"
acura,rdx,2008,neumogirl, 09/25/2007,Love this car!,pos,"Have had this car for about two weeks and love it.  Test drove all the CUVs from upscale/luxury to affordable/no frills; from ML350 and X3 to the Ford Edge and Mazda CX7, even drove a Hyundai Santa Fe.  None compared to the RDX for the money and the features.  It's so much fun to drive and is extremely comfortable.  Came from Infiniti M45 so I know comfort and this RDX is just as cushy.  Look forward to showing it off to my friends.  It was a long process to decide but I'm sure glad I took my time and chose the RDX.  It was the best choice for my money!  I ordered chrome wheels and now it's looking so pretty!"
acura,rdx,2008,rob, 09/19/2007,Great Car,pos,"Wife loves the car.  Easy to park, drive, and back camera is great. "
acura,rdx,2008,Great Car!, 10/10/2007,Great Car!,pos,"After purchasing this car almost two months ago, I decided I had to write a review considering I have found the reviews out on Edmunds to be very helpful.  I purchased the RDX after my 2002 VW Jetta broke down which happened frequently.  The Acura is a wonderful car in general, and the RDX is great!  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  It is easy to drive, easy to park, has great acceleration when needed.  It is super comfortable and just big enough that I feel like trucks can see me better on the highway.  I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for solid reliability and easy maintenance."
acura,rdx,2008,dan, 09/24/2007,Technology Package,pos,"If you get bored easily, opt for the technology package.  Not only will this car talk to you but it will let you know exactly whats going on performance-wise down to each wheel.  The rumors of turbo lag are true from stand-still acceleration.  However, when the turbo kicks in, it's like no feeling a V6 can offer.  You feel like you are being lifted off your seat then pushed back into it.  My wife has a Murano.  This car is much smoother, ride, acceleration, braking and even the seats are softer.  If you want the performance that may outrun a BMW 3 series but need room for the family pet, this is the vehicle!"
acura,rdx,2008,benlee78, 10/17/2007,2008 RDX Base,pos,"Since my wife had a baby, I have traded my 06 Acura TL (base) for the 08 RDX base model. Even though I miss my TL, I thought this was a good trade.  Pros: This is a fun and powerful vehicle. The turbo gives it an extra kick in acceleration. AWD gives the vehicle more stability. Interior and the exterior design is pretty decent. Stereo sounds is great. Price value is pretty good for a luxury/sport vehicle. "
acura,rdx,2008,RDXTech, 11/11/2007,Fun car,pos,"Bought this last month replacing the RX 300 we had and the features are so much better. Very comparable luggage space to the RX 300. Just had a kid and the big Chicco stroller fits in easily along with bags from weekend grocery. Have never towed, so no complains about the 1500 lbs capacity there. Still need to try the paddle shifters."
acura,rdx,2008,CHdriver, 03/11/2008,Try It; You'll Love It!,pos,"The RDX was the last car we looked at before we were going to commit to an BMW X3. Are we glad we looked! Absolutely great price and deal, and so much car. Saved at least $7,000 of the X3 and we still got everything we wanted. "
acura,rdx,2008,Ellen Mansour, 12/06/2007,Repeat Acura customer for a reason,pos,"Can't beat Acura for reliability, safety and stability on the road.  The technology package is easy to use, the sound system is impressive and it drives like a dream.  I couldn't be happier."
acura,rdx,2008,Scorpion18, 03/25/2008,Awesome Sporty Machine,pos,"I drove a Camry V6 for 3 years and was just enough happy with it but wanted a sporty drive, tried X3, BMW 3 series, Lexus IS 350, CX-7 and a few more before finalizing on this one and I am glad I went to see it. It is a awesome combo or class, features, acceleration and I love the ELS system with 10 speakers making it better sounding than any other vehicle I tried."
acura,rdx,2008,VB, 12/10/2007,Wow!,pos,"Never did a review before, but had to comment on my new ride.  Overall this car is terrific.  I find a new feature I love every day.  I am on my 5th tank of gas and am getting 21.8 mpg.  Traded an '03 Aviator that never got better than 16, so I'm thrilled.  Looks good, feels good, drives good.  Never owned a 4 cyl. before.  Can't believe the pick up.  Plenty of power when you need it.  Love it! Love it!"
acura,rdx,2008,DWB, 04/13/2008,Wonderful driving experience,pos,"I purchased the RDX 2 weeks ago with 7 miles on it. It now has nearly 1000 miles with combined city and highway miles. The day after I picked it up I drove 550 miles and averaged 23 MPG. 90% of the time it was downpouring rain in the mountains of WV and VA. I've been averaging 18 MPG around town however I do not sit in traffic very much. I had a Civic and it was a great mode of transportation. However, the RDX is a driving experience with immense pleasure from the XM radio and sound system to the handling and comfort. Also got the protection package, wheel locks and tow package."
acura,rdx,2008,Otto, 04/30/2008,Love This Vehicle,pos,Traded in my 2003 Highlander for an RDX on 4/18/08 and wish I had done it sooner.  I put over 800 miles on during the first week and I couldn't be happier.  The turbo is awesome and the technology package is great.  Mileage is slightly better than the 17/22 on the sticker.  I was looking to downsize a bit and just couldn't bring myself to purchase a sedan.  What a great choice.  This baby drives like a sports car and still gives me some options on the utility side of things.
acura,rdx,2008,Nancy, 05/07/2008,If Only Gas Was Free!,pos,"I absolutely love this car.  It is sporty, fast, handles well, comfortable, super fun to drive.  Unfortunately, I live in a busy city and this is not the car for city driving.  Gas mileage is awful.  I average 16 miles/gallon city driving.  Haven't taken it on the open road yet.  This car is perfect for less populated areas."
acura,rdx,2008,3rdAcura, 05/30/2008,Fun to Drive,pos,"I leased this vehicle back in November 07 after trading in my TL, and have been very pleased overall. There is a slight clinking sound from somewhere under the dash that randomly comes and goes and the dealer cannot identify it. Aside from this which does not affect performance, the ride is both quick and sporty. Pick up is incredible with the turbo engine. I find that the cargo space is adequate for our needs and we can fit our child's stroller in the back easily. I can also get golf clubs in back without having to angle them. It is a fast sporty sedan in a mini SUV body. We proceeded to get rid of our Jeep Hemi Engine and lease an MDX as well putting us into our third Acura."
acura,rdx,2008,Cindy, 05/30/2008,Better than BMW X3,pos,"Before purchasing the RDX, I drove a 2005 BMW X3 for three years.  I loved my X3, but the newer models are quite expensive.  I'm just delighted with the RDX.  It has a similar drive to the X3 and the savings over the X3 is huge.  Was treated very well by the dealer and I've had for a week and absolutely adore this vehicle. It is designed very well and the interior of the car is actually nicer than the X3, in my opinion.  The seating is every bit as good as the X3.   I'm looking forward to my first long road trip in my new RDX.  It corners like a BMW and has a sports car type feeling when you drive it.  It is a nice package!"
acura,rdx,2008,pathfinder11, 04/01/2020,cheap interior,neg,"don't buy one, leather and pleather is so inferior I don't really know what to compare it to, door inserts, armrests, center console top all had to be replaced, seat stitching pulling out.  Terrible gas mileage but engine seems to be ok otherwise"
acura,rdx,2008,elizabethok, 08/01/2013,"ACURA RDX NAVIGATION, SPEEDOMETER, ODOMETER, TRIP OVERSTATED MILEAGE",neu,"This car has an overstated mileage problem approximately every 10 miles adds 5 miles in turn uses the gas. Acura dealer service depts. will not acknowledge the problem, test or accept responsibility. In my own car I have been lied to. I log near every mile I drive to check the discrepancy. This car has been refused to be serviced by dealer service depts. Client relations does nothing for me except log and ask to accept apology. "
acura,rdx,2008,Quiltdiva, 02/24/2008,I love it,pos,"I have been looking at the 2009 Nissan Murano, Mazda CX-7 & 9, Subaru Tribeca and 2008 Nissan Rogue.  The RDX is just right for me. All those wonderful luxury features plus not so huge.  It drives really stiff, more like a sports car and the seats are wonderful. I made the right decision for me."
acura,rdx,2008,CHdriver, 03/06/2008,A Lot of Car & Fun,pos,Have owned the car for almost 3 weeks. Wife & I been looking at BMW X3 & Highlander (go figure). Looked at the RDX as a lark! Both of us immediately fell in love with it. It offered so much for the price. 
acura,rdx,2008,aust_lr, 08/28/2008,2008 Acura RDX,pos,"The RDX is a great small SUV. It is fun to drive, handles well, and looks great. It is a little pricey for a car that competes with the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV 4 but it is better than them in performance and build quality."
acura,rdx,2008,Christopher Cromer, 11/16/2016,Outstanding!,pos,"Best purchase ever, love it!
"
acura,rdx,2008,khanna111, 04/11/2009,Almost a year - BP up and down,neu,"It has almost been a year since I bought the RDX. I was impressed by the kick from the turbo and the Acura reputation in *quality* etc. It all started with the rattles, squeaks and then somehow the turbo lost its zing. Got the rattle on the tail gate fixed. The dealer said that he has seen this with other RDXs as well. The driver's door has an intermittent issue with some sort of flapping sound and an even more infrequent window glass rattle. The dashboard in front of the steering has an infrequent noise coming in. It gets more regular and easier to hear when the sun is out and at low speeds. The zing from the turbo and the acceleration is missing out recently - should have gone for infinity"
acura,rdx,2008,Tom, 02/24/2008,Waste of money,neg,"Definitely not worth 33,000 dollars. No leg room for back seats. No auto turn on/off of headlights. Rough riding. Opening the driver door after a drive will not open the back door. You have to use either the remote or the door button to open the back doors. Bad fuel economy. Wish there was atleast a beep sound when you back up to walls or curb (expect that for cars over 30000). Tom"
acura,rdx,2008,af145, 07/23/2008,Great so far!,pos,"We've had this car for 2 weeks, and both my wife and I love it so far.  Turbo works great, giving you the extra boost when needed and staying ""asleep"" while you are just cruising along the highway.  The RDX handles much better than the 2002 Honda Accord V6 we used to drive.  The car is truly loaded with features.  To pick a few: the navigation system knows your speed and gives you correct instructions even while the satellites are obstructed; the HUGE center storage keeps the glove box free of regular clutter (radar detector, Garmin nav) and has enough space for my wife's purse; voice recognition correctly understands our accented English; homelink replaces the ugly garage door remote."
acura,rdx,2008,Lazo, 04/22/2010,Nice Car,pos,You will not enjoy this car unless you really have patience and read the guide. I purchased this car for my wife and we are happy with it. This is a strong stable car you can rely on. Many features you will discover as you read the guide. Thanks to Reviews in this site I took the decision to buy this car.
acura,rdx,2008,richman3, 12/31/2010,"it's true.. good but could be better, easily",pos,"It is true, all that was written by the reviewers on edmunds... The glove box slams on the passengers legs, the cup holders are not adjustable, the lights are not automatic, the GPS cannot be seen when sunny, center console oepns to side instead of up, your have to hit the OK button every single time on the GPS unit, I mean every time you get in the car. This is silly, and could also be easily recitified. Just download a patch.
etc. etc.
All of these could easily be fixed. Come on Acura this will take just a little effort. That being said I love the pickup and handling and it has plenty of utility for me. Just throw my hockey stuff in and go. e on Acura, this is a luxury brand. "
acura,rdx,2008,ScottyB, 11/10/2007,So far so good....,neu,"I leased this car last month, and am generally pleased so far. It drives well with nice power and handling, although the ride is a little bumpy, if you are used to a luxury or performance sedan."
acura,rdx,2008,Dan, 11/05/2007,The 2008 RDX beats all the competition,pos,"I love my RDX. I've had this vehicle for almost a month now and I'm very impressed with everything about this SUV. I spent a lot of time researching and comparing different vehicles but once I started test driving them, the Acura RDX with the Tech package really beats all the competition. It's the best luxury for my money. Stereo sound is amazing. Interior and exterior finishing fantastic. Its fun to drive because of the smooth and powerful handling. I'm really happy with my purchase."
acura,rdx,2008,Alex, 11/08/2007,The perfect SUV for us,pos,"Handling and acceleration are far better than the other SUVs we test drove - Lexus RX 350, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander.  Feature for feature, none of the other SUVs we considered could beat the RDX's value.  Good thing too, because none of them were nearly as fun.  This is an SUV that will provide us plenty of utility, allow us to grow in it, yet small enough for the city, and will continue to be fun so that we won't mind keeping it for a while."
acura,rdx,2008,Sean, 11/19/2007,My Mom loves it!,pos,"Gave this car to my Mom for her birthday.  Replaced a benz E-320 with just 8k miles, but she likes the Acura even more."
acura,rdx,2008,nomorecivicsi02, 12/01/2007,Perfect size. Great fun.,pos,"I needed a vehicle to replace my 2002 civic Si.  The first time I drove the RDX I knew I wanted one. This thing is as much fun to drive as my Si. If you're looking for a small, quick, great handling SUV with some luxury, this is the vehicle for you. "
acura,rdx,2008,JohnnyV, 03/31/2008,"So far, the best car I ever owned",pos,"I traded in a 2005 Subaru WRX STi which I bought new after months of research. It was terrible.  I've had the RDX a month and it's an extraordinary vehicle. For someone w/ low back problems the driver's seat/position is perfect, unlike the poor seat in the Toyota RAV 4.  I'll check back in a few months."
acura,rdx,2008,czechmate, 12/11/2007,Nice car to have,pos,"I only have a few hundred miles on it. It is well made with nice internals and a few bugs. Complicated not-so-friendly navigation system. One must learn the exact commands (over 100 of them) to handle it safely and efficiently while driving. There is information missing on streets that have been in existence for many (7) years. If that is to be programmed one needs to look up MAP-IT beforehand and find the major intersection.. The engine require synthetic MOBIL-1 oil, and a higher octane gasoline. Trunk is large enough but be prepared to purchase the cargo net. "
acura,rdx,2008,Ravi, 05/27/2008,Powerful RDX... like a bomb,pos,Purchased base RDX 3 months ago. Its value for money and it delivers as promised. Like its initial pickup. You will be ahead of traffic!! Like its estimated MPG feature and shows how fuel efficient you can drive. I am getting around 16 miles in city. 
acura,rdx,2008,chicagordx, 06/25/2008,Highly Recommended,pos,"Checked out the Nissan Murano and BMW X3...Saved about $5k in regards to the Murano and $10k in regards to the X3 by opting for the RDX. This car is worth every cent...luxury, yet it feels like driving a sports car. Navigation/AcuraLink is fabulous and the best one out there. Definitely check it out before saying ""I'll just buy a Garmin"". Its worth the upgrade in price. Only negative is the gas mileage, I have 500 miles on the car and average about 14.4 mpg. The good thing is that my commute is only 2 miles each way to work so its not too bad. If you're in the market for something in this market, definitely be sure to check the RDX out..its so much fun to own. "
acura,rdx,2008,Tyler, 03/29/2008,Very happy with purchase,pos,"It has great acceleration and hugs the road very well.  The suspension is stiff and reminds me of my old RSX-S (could be good or bad depending on the driver).  I've driven from TX to CA in this and was not fatigued.  All in all, it is a pleasure to drive.  I do extensive research whenever I buy pretty much anything and I found this to be a better buy than the competitors."
acura,rdx,2009,Nick, 03/20/2010,Know what you're buying,pos,"We wanted a AWD vehicle to travel in winter to Northern NV and Sierra Nevada mtns. We wanted a small SUV.  We loved the CR-V but it was a Dog (4 Cyl.) and the Rav4 was stylish 10 years ago, so we checked out the RDX.  It has impressive quickness & handling and it's really fun to drive.  What we didn't expect is the gas mileage.  We have only gotten 17 mpg in town once and highway isn't much over 20.  On long trips be prepared to gas up frequently (and always with premium). Overall I really like the SUV and the fact that the turbo doesn't lose power with elevation.  Know what your buying -an AWD SUV w/ a turbo- and accept that you won't get great mileage."
acura,rdx,2009,accurashopper, 07/09/2009,"A fun, fun, fun sporty little SUV",pos,"I absolutely adore this SUV! I drove a mid-size sedan for many years and it did take some time to adjust to the RDX. The tilt down mirror on the passenger side is wonderful when backing.  The interior is well laid out with all of the controls within easy reach.  The center console is deep - it holds my large purse with room to spare. The front seats are comfortable and there's ample knee space in the rear with the front seats all the way back.   Ride is firm - you feel some of the bumps and hear a little road noise, but the fun factor outweighs any of this.   Fits my small family perfectly. Represented an excellent value for the money compared w/competition.  Currently get 19 mpg city."
acura,rdx,2009,ronispeech, 07/05/2011,compares to other luxury vehicles,pos,"We have driven Lexus, BMW, Jeep and Infinity SUV'S and have been most impressed with our Acura RDX!!
This SUV handles beautifully and we have only required scheduled maintenance for oil changes.
We plan on purchasing/leasing a second RDX this spring."
acura,rdx,2009,jmh12, 12/28/2011,Comparing the RDX to BMW X3,pos,"I traded my X3 for a used RDX. While the X3 was a good car, it's reliability was waning after 100K. The RDX was a great choice. Reminds me of the X3. Ride is about the same (choppy over rough spots) but handles even better than the X3. Seems roomier and gets a bit better gas mileage. Sure you can get low miles if you keep your foot in the turbo. I'm getting 23 to 27 on the highway and 19 in town. This is the AWD version too. I have an MDX that's been a reliable car. I expect the RDX to follow suit. It's a great car for one who enjoys driving and isn't put off by the tight suspension. Plus it's an Acura."
acura,rdx,2009,Lindsey, 03/29/2010,Love this car,pos,"I'm really enjoying this SUV! I really love the size and room it has on the inside! The only problems that I've had are the speakers, I blew three of them! And I have no idea how! This car is fun to drive and everyone that rides in this car loves it! I looked at many SUV's before purchasing this one! This one was by far the best! Perfect size and not a lot of people have this car! SO you wont have the same car as everyone else!"
acura,rdx,2009,Jim, 05/07/2016,Bumpy ride,pos,"Gas mileage for 4 cylinder is poor and vehicle uses premium fuel. Ride is quite uncomfortable.
"
acura,rdx,2009,JEM, 11/12/2008,A winner for Acura,pos,"Having leased 2 MDXs over the past six years, I had no reason to look outside the Acura line to lease a new vehicle. I did, however want to economize on lease payments and no longer needed the additional space and seating of the MDX.  The RDX really fills the bill.  Super handling, great performance and real comfort for the driver and front seat passenger.  The traditional Acura safety features and interior appointments are apparent.  The voice activated tech package is awesome tho requires familiarity.  This is just a feel good vehicle to drive."
acura,rdx,2009,LC, 11/25/2008,"Fun, great mid-size SUV",pos,Let me say that I love Acuras because of the value you get with the car.  No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price.  All the toys work and make this a great car to drive.  It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG. It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get. This is not a luxury sedan.  What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven. 
acura,rdx,2009,erik Jensen, 12/03/2008,Best performance in class!,pos,"Just purchased - compared to BMW x3 and Mazda C7.  I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette, my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency.  Looked at Subaru WRX, WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family.  The Acura is loaded with options, well built (solid), comfortable enough.  Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive.  I am surprised they don't market this differently.  Turbo 4 banger, SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber - snow is good!  I can also fit kids, wife, dog, etc.  Very happy with performance, technology is overdone - voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level"
acura,rdx,2009,Amyjo, 12/21/2008,Fun and sporty,pos,"I have only had this car for a few days, but I LOVE it! I have always loved Hondas and I have wanted AWD drive for years, so this is the perfect mix of fun and safety. The turbo and handling are impressive. It's like a sport sedan with higher clearance, AWD, and more trunk space."
acura,rdx,2009,Leonid, 04/23/2009,Great Car,pos,I have been driving this car for about a month and I have really enjoyed every moment in it while at the wheel. It accelerates and runs great. The turbo engine is amazing. My wife and I like the RDX exterior and interior. The ergonomics is virtually perfect. I think the RDX is one of the best buys on the SUV market.
acura,rdx,2009,tom, 05/05/2009,Long term review,pos,"Have owned the SUV for one year and 18k miles now. Fun to drive, good visibility, excellent handling and did real well in the New England winter. I am not a very aggressive driver and don't use the paddle shifters much.  I do a mix of highway and city driving. I am averaging 21 mpg.  The rear suspension is very firm which could be uncomfortable for rear adult passengers on longer trips. I owned another Acura five years ago.  I was disappointed with the fit and finish of my SUV.  Total of three trim pieces on the dashboard and passengers door panels were replaced under warranty because they became loose.  Had to also take it back for rattling sound behind the glove box ."
acura,rdx,2009,Tim, 02/07/2016,Sports car in SUV shell,pos,"The sportiest of a batch of SUVs available that year: BMW X3, Volvo XC60, and Audi Q5. Excellent mechanical reliability, although a couple electronics issues with the side-view mirror.
"
acura,rdx,2009,itzsyk, 12/17/2011,What a snatch!,pos,"It's been 2 great years since I first picked this baby up. The biggest reason for choosing this car, is because the 2.3 liter engine from Honda is only used in the RDX. The small turbo is also very peppy. There's virtually no lag - VTec kicks just under 4k rpm. Unfortunately, the drop in peak power is very noticeable. The ride is stiff, but supple. Just enough to feel confident without suffering back pains. I put regular gas for 1k miles recently, and to my surprise, there was no loss in power. But, there was loss in the stiffness of the steering wheel. Regardless, I advise premium gas. The brakes were the biggest disappointment. They feel like they stop 60-0 in 130-140 ft. "
acura,rdx,2009,jbriscoe, 07/01/2012,Like an MDX and Accord all in one,pos,"I owned a 03 MDX and 07 Accord V6 previously...I wanted to go back to a SUV...just not a large one. The RDX fit the bill for me. I get 22 mpg non highway driving at an avg speed of 28 mph, I drive 66 mi daily round trip to work. The turbo kicks in when needed and the ride inside the cabin is quiet. The road feel can be bumpy on poorly maintained streets and the handling is great on quick turns.
If you need more cargo room and a fold down third seat, opt for the MDX and a few less mpg. I'm 5'3 and my husband is 6'1 and we both have plenty of head and leg room."
acura,rdx,2009,Fred, 07/08/2009,Beware,neu,"This is not the luxury car that Acura should be selling.  Unlike other Acuras, the vehicle does not have automatic headlights, a basic safety and convenience feature available on similar, and many far less expensive cars.  The gas mileage is far less than advertised.  It is very difficult to open the rear door.  The instrument panel, particularly the radio controls, are poorly designed and difficult to use.  While the turbo engine is very good and the ride is decent, the car is not what I have come to expect from Acura -- they should be ashamed."
acura,rdx,2009,Frank G CPA, 08/23/2008,RDX Worst Horrible Ride ever,neg,"First the RDX is NOT a luxury auto by any standards.  The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint.  On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle.  I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else.  I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX.  Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response ""well it is based on a truck"" so I don't expect future models to address the ride."
acura,rdx,2009,AJJ, 10/26/2008,Buyer's Remorse,neu,"I drove the RDX 2x before deciding to buy and I sincerely regret it. There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying. The gas mileage has not improved with time, only getting 13 mpg. The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash. The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine. The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid. Other Acura models have this feature, except RDX. For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW. Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options, but they make a great driving machine. Acura, in my book, has a long way to go. "
acura,rdx,2009,RZeman, 01/05/2009,Some Remorse,pos,"This is my fourth Acura.  The last being an MDX.  While I realize this is an ""entry level"" SUV the quality and luxury of Acura has been scaled down on this vehicle.  When my Lexus RX350 lease ended I didn't want to get the same car twice and the MDX has gotten to big with no more kids or large dog to haul around.  There some features left off of this Acura which should be standard issue i.e. automatic headlights and power rear door, rain sensing wipers.  The gas mileage is ridiculous.  We celebrate when I can hold the average at 19 mpg for more than 10 minutes and that is with freeway driving.  I will not purchase another RDX."
acura,rdx,2009,fischb, 12/22/2009,Deeply Conflicted,neu,"I am deeply conflicted about this car.  It drives sporty and tight, but on rough pavement it is too bumpy.  There are 3 competing electronic displays, but technology is about 8 years old.  Voice recognition is the worst as is the nav.  Fuel economy is stellar for this segment, 22 MPG, but linear accelleration is impossible due to the mismanaged turbos.  The leather is cheaper than Benz's imitation stuff.  Handling on snow is bad due to torquiness, so I had to get snow tires.  Exterior styling is suspect, but I like its small size.  In the end, I am trading after one year for a BMW X6, if only to save my sanity from the tortuous fan whine when you turn on the heat."
acura,rdx,2009,Priscilla Morris, 12/04/2009,Worst car I have ever owned,neg,"Rough ride, poor interior quality, way too expensive to be this bad . So sad it is such a sorry ride and quality."
acura,rdx,2009,Double L, 02/05/2010,CAN'T WAIT TO GET RID OF,neu,"The dealer would NOT allow us to take on highway; now I know why.  The ride is so bumpy that you feel sick to your stomach.  We can't get the sports suspension changed because it will cause the warranty to be invalid.  I should have walked away after being jacked around by the dealership with agreeing to match printed price of others; and then hemm & ha for 5 hours trying to figure out how to get out of that one.  I should of, could of, and didn't; so now I'm stuck with a vehicle that makes me throw up on bumpy highways or gets us dizzy."
acura,rdx,2009,Disappointed, 11/24/2008,Not Happy,neg,"Very disappointed, poor value for the price.  Seats are uncomfortable (I'm 5'10"", always hitting my thigh on steering wheel); nav system very complicated; voice recognition never accurate (say ""go home"" and nav responds with ""air conditioner off"").  Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position, if wheels are not straight, you will have problems turning the key in the ignition.  Gas mileage is awful; acceleration certainly not 'peppy'; requires premium gas; oil changes require synthetic oil.  Bought this car outright (not leased).  After 2 months I am considering getting rid of this car and buying something more comfortable with better nav & mileage."
acura,rdx,2009,Levelheaded, 06/16/2009,2 Years Later,pos,"This is a jazzed up Honda at best. By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury, in fact, an Accord V6 may be more luxurious. That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV. The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together."
acura,rdx,2009,Ron in Alaska, 09/17/2008,RDX A Great Car For Alaska,pos,"Have less than 1,000 miles on the car and averaged 22 mpg on the second tank of gasoline with both town and highway driving.  The turbo comes on quick, if you need it.  We like the stiff suspension and look forward to the AWD during our long Alaska winters.  This is our third turbo car and they just keep getting better and better.  Enjoying the memory power seats and mirrors with two drivers of different heights.  With the easy to fold-down rear seats, it provides plenty of room for those shopping trips.  We spent a year looking at various crossovers and the RDX always moved to the top of the list.  We keep our cars 12+ years and look forward to a long term relationship. "
acura,rdx,2009,NirVTEC, 09/24/2008,Drivers vehicle!,pos,What a blast to drive! Hugs turns like a sport luxury sedan and pulls off the stoplight like Old V8s I have owned! 
acura,rdx,2009,dba, 10/11/2008,Acura RDX: good deal,pos,"First SUV I own, and very pleased with it. They did a great job to reduce the turbo lag; you can notice it but it is definitely acceptable. Very good looking SUV with the luxury touch you find on all Acuras. Looking forward to try it in snow here in Boston."
acura,rdx,2009,El Supremo, 11/15/2008,Horrible Suspension for NYC,pos,"I bought the car looking at the Mazda CX7, Nissan Murano, etc.  Actually found that the RDX is only a bit more expensive then the Mazda so I went with it.  The look and interior is awesome but its way to stiff.  Every pothole makes the car jump, it feels like an old school jeep.   I bought it for comfort and luxury, but this is way to jeep.  It really gets annoying (even embarrassing sometimes.  I really love the car otherwise but this is a major flaw."
acura,rdx,2009,hm, 11/18/2008,Exactly What I Expected,pos,"This is not my first Acura. These vehicles are designed to be a balance between value and luxury.  Are they German engineered - NO. That said, they are good performers with great reliability. This is a fun vehicle to drive loaded with features that would be costly options on other brands.  Fuel economy is based upon how aggressively you drive and the car is not going to magically transform into something else after to take it home - so give it a good test drive!     "
acura,rdx,2009,Dstew, 11/30/2008,5000 Texas miles with no regrets,pos,Ive been on just about every type of terrain and this SUV has performed admirably.  Highway and street ride and performance is great.  Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged.  On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG.  Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing.  In the city MPG is closer to 18.  On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well.  Dirt roads are the same.  I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle.  Almost every feature you need is included.
acura,rdx,2009,hsm, 01/03/2009,Good Performer,pos,"I have had this vehicle for a litle over 2 months now.  Just got back from a ski trip with the family.  First, let me say the SHAWD is the best AWD system I have ever had.  The vehicle handles snow like you are on asphalt! Mileage is all in how you drive - I am getting between 21 to 24 mpg combined with conservative driving.  Beware that the suspension is stiff - trade-off the vehicles handles very nicely.   "
acura,rdx,2009,Triple, 01/06/2009,Best Bang for the Buck,pos,"Originally we were set on a wagon to replace both a Pathfinder and a Saab sedan. However, when you look at what's out there in similar trim levels (new - Saab, Audi, BMW, Volvo) they get comparable gas mileage, with just a bit more room, but for 10K+ more. That made the RDX a no-brainer. Yes, it has a firm ride - it's on the sport side of SUV. It's much better than a truck-based SUV (such as my PF), and by giving up a Caddy-like ride, you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling. Yes, gas mpg isn't the best - but it also has a turbo that has zero lag with effortless acceleration, and is no worse than other crossovers. This car's not for someone wanting a boring town runabout."
acura,rdx,2009,Mrgoody, 01/09/2009,2009 Acura,pos,"Just got my Acura RDX, overall I like the truck.  0-60 is great and mileage is decent. Build quality is excellent and the cabin is very quiet. However I am disappointed in the way it handles in snow - the car tends to lose rear end during turns in snow, especially if you take the turn fast. I was expecting esp would help but it does not. However in a straight line the truck is solid."
acura,rdx,2009,Disloquitor, 01/27/2009,Nimble Family-first car,pos,"Came off of an A6 4.2 lease, wanted to downsize and have more fun, while allowing my middle-aged body to lift the children into the rear car seats without back break. High center of gravity concerns moot at anything up to 7/10ths driving (i.e. public roads) because of flat cornering and absorbing suspension.  (Absorbing as in GTI, not Buick.) Also useful in deeper snow.  It's not a sports car or sedan, but it's a a brilliant urban/suburban commuter, actually fun on a twisty parkway.  Seats are surprisingly good.  Tighter body structure on rough roads than an X3, no Audi suspension crash.  No Audi interior, leather or BMW brakes or steering either, but not enough difference to justify $15K"
acura,rdx,2009,Dave, 01/29/2009,2009 Acura,neu,"I have had my Acura for 2 months now and have close to 1,800 miles. I have had a rattle on the left hand side of the car since 65 miles. I am bringing it back to the dealer again next week. The cars mpg has never gotten over 16. It is the winter in WI. It handles well in the snow but not any better than my BMW 525XI was. The interior parts are very cheap. It is very bumpy in the city and drives like a jeep wrangler. I had better expectations from this car. It is not of a near luxury type of car. I lease it and have to drive it for another 34 months. I was recently in a Ford Escape that did not rattle like mine and had a quieter ride. Dealer apologizes but tells me I shouldn't expect much."
acura,rdx,2009,Rich, 02/01/2009,Great SUV,pos,"Just purchased this vehicle yesterday and just wanted to say that my family and I enjoy every feature. Very quick in response off the line. Can barely feel the gears shift. Interior very well designed. Many fun options even with a base model. Why spend 4,000 more for a nav and a couple extra speakers? Handling is great. Gas mileage is to be expected from having a turbo installed. To anyone else complaining about this you should do your homework first. Besides wouldn't want to give your car the best of the best servicing? That's what makes cars last longer. Take this for what it's worth yet this car is a great small family vehicle."
acura,rdx,2009,Grant, 03/11/2009,Sea to ski,pos,"My lease had come up on my 05 Infiniti FX35...a beautifully designed and performing vehicle.  I looked at the BMW X3, the Infiniti FX35 and the Acura RDX.  The obvious question was, what was I going to have to give up to move to a less expensive vehicle.  Surprisingly... not much.  Negatives on the RDX no automatic headlights strange... almost awkward styling, poor mileage, no compass, very basic rims, rough ride for some, strange cargo cover.  Big Positves! Sports car handling and acceleration awesome, AWD system,  look at it this way... if money wasn't an object, I'd be deciding between the BMW X6 or the FX50.  Saving some money and not giving up the farm feels pretty good."
acura,rdx,2009,EH, 04/16/2009,2009 RDX,pos,"RDX is my first SUV. It has roomy interior and handles quite nice for its size. The ride quality is not for everyone since it is stiff sport suspension. It's supposed to be an entry level luxury SUV, but I don't really see that. Hope Acura pays little more attention to finish quality since interior rattle is really annoying."
acura,rdx,2009,corduroygt, 06/15/2009,Good value for Money,pos,"I got my RDX tech for around 32k + taxes.  I think for the price, the feature content is great.  I don't know why people think it rides harsh, I think the ride/handling balance is just right, sporty and confidence inspiring without being too harsh or floaty.   The worst thing about this car is the omission of a couple cheap-but-nice features, and the fuel economy, which could have been better if they put the V6 under the hood.  It's got more than enough power to deal with traffic."
acura,rdx,2009,Lynne, 06/15/2009,Love It!,pos,"I just picked up my new RDX & I LOVE IT! I traded in my 10 yr old Saturn which I loved (low maint. & great reliability) but wanted an upgrade in quality (interior, features, etc). I do a lot of driving & the RDX has NOT disappointed so far. I read a LOT of reviews before buying & I have to say that the ride is a little rough but was expecting the ""sporty drive"" so I don't mind it. I have to respectfully disagree w/ complaints about the fuel economy. My 4-cyl Saturn ave. 30mpg, so I was prepared for a big bite into my fuel budget. Have put about 200miles on the RDX so far and I'm ave. 25mpg (60% hwy). Not bad! I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it."
acura,rdx,2009,rd, 08/13/2009,Fun to Drive,pos,"I love this car! I have an Acura MDX too but this thing is fast. The seats are very comfortable, cabin noise is minimal. I do not understand the poor mileage complaint. I have driven the car for last 7000 miles and I have consistently gotten around 22 mpg. Nice leg space in rear seats. Good sound system. Great value for money and without sacrificing the fun part. Fast acceleration when needed. If you are looking into CR-V or RAV4 with all options, please buy this instead. Worth it! Nice ride too. Truly, not bumpy at all. They must have and 'have' softened the suspension since the original 2007 model. Its as good as any other SUV. "
acura,rdx,2009,Jack Gantos, 09/10/2009,Not overly impressed,neu,"I've had my RDX for nearly three years on a lease and I will be turning it in and not getting another. The gas mileage is well below what is listed at 17mpg in town. I live in Boston and drive around town and get about 11/12 miles per gallon, and I'm not a lead foot. The Turbo is not as responsive as it should be--there is some lag, but it is not bad when it kicks in. Just not as perfect as the sales people tell you it is. The interior is basic. Visibility is routine. Body design is nice. But the interior trim is just an upgraded version of a Nisson X-Terra. I question if my ""leather"" seats are really leather. They remind me of the Mercedes leather- like material I had in my Turbo D.    "
acura,rdx,2009,Mark from Sacramento, 10/22/2009,Never Again,neu,"My wife got the car and she seems happy with it, but I think the lack of visibility out the back is dangerous. The rear window is very small and then further blocked by the driver's headrest. Visibility out the driver's side is also bad because of the frame between driver and passenger windows. The real problem is the delay in acceleration which is maddening. Delay is usually 1 second but if you really need to pull in front of a car to make an exit you need to know it may the sequence which is engine revs, wait a second, wait a second, and then car accelerates, but not quickly. I can't believe this is supposed to be a premium car.  Also high hood blocks forward view a little."
acura,rdx,2009,giri80, 03/17/2010,It's almost one year,pos,"I bought this car as a graduation gift for my self! I already have 25,000 miles on the car drove all across the country. So far the ride is fun. Cabin can be a bit quieter, awesome 4 awd handling it's fun to drive in rain and snow. Fuel economy is excellent on hwy (24) but not good in city (17- 18). Interior materials can be of better material. Plastic used is of low quality. I love the seats though. Climate control, audio, back leg room and cargo space very good. I would suggest this buy over a crv, rav4 or Forester any day.   "
acura,rdx,2009,Sue mancasola, 08/29/2018,Dependable,pos,"Oil change is pricey. Around town mileage not good. Love the turbo but I use it too often for quick starts

acura,rdx,2010,klrsmile, 01/17/2012,"The Best small upscale SUV, hands down",pos,"Having test driven a variety of its competitors, including some SUVs up-market as well as down (GLK, X3, Q5, Highlander) as well as being a former MDX owner, my wife and I were equally impressed with the RDX, albeit for very different reasons.

He:
Love the performance, 0-60 in about 6 seconds - very impressive, and surprisingly nimble, a very fun car to drive.
The stereo is equally impressive, sounds great and free 12 months subscription to satellite insures something for everyone to listen to.


She:
The cargo space handles weekend shopping and family upkeep with ease.
Crash test ratings help keep the kids safe"
acura,rdx,2010,May 2010 Buyer, 10/08/2010,One happy buyer here,pos,"Having used these reviews in my decision, I'm repaying my debt to the forum.  Great car, would buy it again.  I would recommend to anybody looking for something fully loaded for base price, V6 power in a V4, and luxury without the price. Five months and 8,000 miles later, I can appreciate the quality and workmanship even more.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Will , 03/21/2010,Great Purchase,pos,Bought this instead of the CR-V and GLAD we did.  My wife and I have a small family and wanted something bigger than our Accord but with decent gas mileage but still fun to drive.  This fits the ticket.  Averages 22 mpg w/ mixed driving and got 28 on a road trip.  Ride is a little rough but not bad and is more than likely the quality roads we have in Louisiana.  Love the ability to play my mp3's.  Very happy with purchase.
acura,rdx,2010,Bean, 09/14/2010,Navi,pos,"The RDX is exeptional in every way...I'd recommend it to anyone.  The quality is second to none. But I want to stress the superiority of the NAV package.  After a recent road trip in a friend's Lexus, I am embarrassed for Toyota.  The Honda Navi is far superior...the joy stick, zoom in/out, changing addresses on the go, categories of attractions, etc.  The Acura Navi is intuitive, easy to use, fun and informative.  I only have Lexus' to compare it to, but that Toyota's is a total waste of money. "
acura,rdx,2010,Pleased, 11/25/2009,Love it,pos,"I love Honda Motor Company.  Had an MDX before...which loved.  Opted for 2wd b/c I don't need SH-AWD in TX.  Better mpg...but just barely.  Only complaint on RDX is that any 4 cyl. should get 20 MPG at least.  I'm no lead-foot, but I only average 17 MPG in city. The tech package is great.  Very similar to my MDX's, but also controls my ipod and weather forecast.  Love hands-free talk features and the feel of steering.  I don't use paddle-shifters.  Ride is sportier and quicker than MDX, but just slightly bumpier.  Road noise is great...not an issue. Plenty of room for us, but we don't regularly haul anything other than groceries.  I don't tow anything and don't plan to.    "
acura,rdx,2010,bob, 06/17/2010,Nice Commuter SUV,pos,"I finally found it, a compact crossover SUV that has the right combination of luxury, comfort, and drivability at a reasonable price.  My daily big city commute requires superb acceleration and smooth handling to ensure a safe drive.  The Acura RDX gives me this, is fun to drive, and gets reasonable gas mileage.  The seats are wide and welcoming for my 50+ year old body.  The RDX is a very good value compared to other luxury SUVs.  The base model cost 10-15% less than the other SUVs that I considered, yet had all of the features that I wanted.  And when I sit in it, I can tell that Acura delivers a high quality product. "
acura,rdx,2010,follow-up, 04/16/2010,Follow-up Review,pos,"I originally reviewed after only a few days.  Now I have had it about 6 months.  Great car.  Smaller than my MDX, but same great vehicle.  The computer says I get 19.5 mpg all city driving.  FWD is better on fuel than AWD, but still should be better.  Very peppy and easy to drive.  Turbo is great.  Tech package is a must.  I connected my ipod and love the fact the I can control it with normal stereo controls.  Chevy Traverse drove well, but the interior, road noise, and overall drive doesn't even compare to Acura.  I love it.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Follow-up...again..., 08/14/2010,Follow-up to my previous Follow-up,pos,"I've driven it for a year and I LOVE it.  I wondered if I would miss my bigger SUV after the ""new car"" was gone, but I don't.  This is a great car.  Fun to drive, sporty, and easy to fit into any parking place.  MPG could be better, but on the highway I do a little better than 21 MPG so no complaints.  The Navi is superior to competitors' systems for ex, don't have to be in park to enter a new destination, etc.  With seats folded down, I can fit anything I have needed to carry.  MPG is the ONLY draw-back.  I think a 4 cylinder should do better (even if it drives better than a V6) but that's just me.  I just wanted to assure readers that the car is worth the money.  I'd buy it again!"
acura,rdx,2010,Mark, 06/11/2010,Excellent Value and Fully Loaded,pos,"After testing the BMW X3, Lexus, and Audi Q5 we happily selected the RDX. For the value the ""base"" model includes Bluetooth, heated seats, nice sound system, real time rear camera which shows up in the rear view mirror (pretty cool, just to name a few features.  These features are additional packages in other crossovers and add a great deal to the cost. Moreover, the RDX is fun to drive with plenty of pick up, especially around corners.  "
acura,rdx,2010,hmsq5, 02/28/2011,Fun to drive,pos,"This car puts a grin on my face every time I drive! Granted the front shield can be polarizing but overall the car is incredibly fun to drive. I had a '08 A4 prior to the RDX and the RDX handles corners better than the A4. And with way more power. Noise level between the two is about the same but the turbo growl on the RDX is really pleasant. I find the ride to be very comfortable, steering with good road feel and the interior clean and functional.
We have a '11 Q5 2.0 and the RDX is much more fun to drive. The Q5 is bigger, quieter and feels more numb on the roads. It doesn't handle as well as the RDX, costs $8000 more comparably equip and Acura dealers are >>>>> than Audi."
acura,rdx,2010,sad_owner1, 01/29/2014,I too wish I could return,neu,"The 2010 RDX drives like a dream.
Handles very well especially in the snow.
I loved this car until I've had to make the following warranty replaced repairs...
4 new batteries, Replaced auto start, Replaced Air compressor relay switch, Alternator, Windshield wiper switch and still have issues with windshield wipers.

This sadly, will be my last Acura"
acura,rdx,2010,shivaswrath, 12/27/2009,A great segue for a Sports Car owner,pos,"I used to drive a '05 Mitsubishi Evolution VIII. Family changes forced my hand to the RDX, but I have been continually pleasantly surprised.  VERY responsive engine, love the transmission with the paddle shifters, and excellent interior comforts. I do mostly highway commuting and this car has made every stopped moment in traffic on I-95 heaven. A worthwhile, long-term investment; just bear in mind maintenance isn't cheap since the turbo REQUIRES synthetic Mobil 1 ($100 a dealership). "
acura,rdx,2010,Justin, 06/15/2010,2010 RDX Review - SH-AWD,pos,"First time buying an SUV. Looked at the Rouge, Escape Ltd., CX-7, Tiguan - also higher up the XC-60. For the money (paid $33) the RDX blew away the comp. Love the interior (first 'luxury car'), audio is awesome - leather heated, very comfortable seats (fr and bk). exterior is nice. Very peppy, i merge like a champ w/ the turbo. everyone compliments my new ride, & rightly so. I'm a proud owner BUT MPG is killing me. i need AWD (in Alaska) and I'm averaging 18.5 MPG. I drove a Jetta before, so maybe I'm over reacting but premium fuel and 18.5 is the only thing I'm not thrilled with. If you are in the $30-35k range this is the vehicle hands down. Happy Owner"
acura,rdx,2010,AG, 06/13/2010,2010 RDX,pos,"I am very impressed with my RDX. Excellent on long drives. Power on demand with turbo is awesome! Even without technology package, tech features are great and way ahead of competitors. Solid feel with great agile handling. Cargo area very good for size (much better than BMW). Considering features, tremendous price/value. Gas mileage very acceptable for an SUV (23 mpg after only 3 wks. of ownership)."
acura,rdx,2010,Tim , 08/01/2010,Best Bang for the Buck!,pos,"Researched for 6+ months. Looked at Hyundai, KIa, Ford, Toyota, Honda, GMC, Chevy, Nissan. Drove their small crossovers. For the money, paid under 30, this by far the best of the bunch. Fit and finish is top notch, super quiet ride, great acceleration, easy handling. Had owned a TL several years ago and found this as well built. Cost is 15% to 20% under Infinity, Audi and Lexus. The front wheel dive is as good as AWD costing 2 grand more. Would recommend to all. "
acura,rdx,2010,JR, 08/04/2010,2010 RDX - Impressive vehicle,pos,"The refreshed 2010 RDX is a significant improvement over the 2007 through 2009 in the following ways: 1) The ride is more compliant (suspension improvement) 2) The ride is quieter (the reduction in road noise was immediately noticeable) 3) The turbo is quieter from inside the RDX as well as engine noise which is more muted than before. I think they even changed some of the materials a little bit to quiet things down 4) The leather is improved (softer, more supple) 5) The navigation screen is a bit larger 6) USB interface has been added 7) The front grill on this one actually looks classy and more luxurious than the previous front end. 8) Etc, etc, etc. "
acura,rdx,2010,scallaha, 08/25/2010,Not much to not like,pos,"I read plenty of Edmunds reviews for plenty of different cars before deciding on the RDX so now, I'm giving back. I needed something large enough for my small family (wife and kid), but also something I could look forward to driving.  RDX fits the bill. I'm averaging 21 mpg which really isn't bad for a CUV/SUV size car even with upgrading tires to Bridgestone Alenzas (had to swap the hazardous OE tires with something that has traction). Really happy with the handling and performance balance with mpg.  For a CUV, this is quite a fun car to drive. The interior is nice and the stereo in the tech package is way better than I expected. All in all, I'm quite happy with the purchase."
acura,rdx,2010,Garrett, 10/24/2017,Dream Car...that became a Painful Nightmare,neu,"Just to start off the bat, I am only 21 years old. So, a few of my gripes are because of my specific likes and dislikes. For the first year and a half, the car ran like a dream. The turbo engine passed cars no problem. The interior stayed nice and clean and intact. The transmission shifted nicely. Very rarely was it in the shop for any reason other than A/C recharge or oil change. From May of 2014 until April of 2017, this car was the best decision I made.                                                             That was until April 2017. The first strange thing I noticed was that the car would randomly die. Drive it for a few days, leave it sit for 1, car would be dead. Had to get it towed to auto repair. Simple fix, just changed the battery and recharged. Few weeks later, same situation happened again: car would run fine for 2-3 days, then leave it sit for more than 24 hours, and it wouldn't start. Towed it again, auto service just recharged the battery. Funny story...IT DID IT A THIRD TIME! Took it back to auto service. From that point on, it was a trial and error scenario, seeing which functions and features on the car were constantly draining the battery. Tried that once or twice. Only to have the wrong options selected and towed back to auto service. (All-in-all, this process lead to 4 instances of towing a ""dead"" car and 5 instances of the battery dying.) After a month and a half of this problem continuing, finally found the solution: THE BLUETOOTH MODULE! Always connecting to a nearby device even when the car wasn't running, even when the device was not in range. Had the bluetooth module removed and never put back in again. Summer of 2017, the car is running fine...and actually running again. At 127000 miles, I figured something would start to go. The transmission began to slip, jerk, chug, pop, lock, and drop. Revving the engine up to 3-4 RPMs and it wouldn't move, it would actually decrease speed. On the highway was a worse problem: going 40 mph in a 60 CONSTRUCTION ZONE and it felt like the car was in neutral slipping down the hills as I floored the gas pedal. Braking began to pop when getting close to full stop (right before 10 mph and less) it would chug forward and then stop). At 136,000 miles, it has continued with the problems in the transmission, shifting, and braking and doesn't look to be improving. Dealers and auto mechanics swear there is nothing wrong with transmission or shifting. It feels like a chore to drive anymore. Will be getting a new car soon enough. But....loved the Turbo while it lasted.
"
acura,rdx,2010,dahaad3925, 06/05/2011,Not really good for the money,neu,"The RDX was really convenient for the extra cargo space, but it lacked two things that really bugged me. 1.) storage space in the cabin. There was absolutely no where to put anything out of sight in the cargo compartment. I wish they had put more little cubbies to store stuff in. 2.) The cabin noise when you drive down the street. I could hear everything and it drove me nuts! I am a luxury car owner. Before the RDX I owned a BMW, and in comparison I wanted my BMW back everyday. Overall, I don't think the RDX was worth the almost 40K I paid for it brand new. I'm not going to lie, the surround sound and technology was nice, but it's practicality is why it gets a partial substandard review."
acura,rdx,2010,amit batt, 10/06/2009,Wish I could return it,neg,"We bought this car to downsize from our Volvo XC90 - and be more ""green"". What a mistake! The mileage is no better despite the miserably small cabin and trunk (looks big but doesn't hold much). This car should never be bought by a family - if you are a young couple who doesn't drive far or carry much (or mind the 90+ dB road noise) , then, I have a vehicle for you."
acura,rdx,2010,David Collantes, 08/08/2015,Avoid at all cost,neg,"Very unreliable car, poorly manufactured. ""Leather interior"" is not quite leather, instrumentation will not give you details on battery not charging, or similar issues until it is fully dead. Ride is not comfortable, ""eats"" gas like a monster. Overall craft of the car is poor. Will never buy an Acura again, unless it comes straight from Japan.
"
acura,rdx,2010,trome, 11/08/2009,A Winner!,pos,"I picked up my RDX today and found the fit and finish to be excellent and the seats the most comfortable I have ever sat in except perhaps for Volvo. I priced up a Volvo XC60 and if you option it out with things that are standard on the base RDX like leather, blue tooth, heated seats, XM rado, bi xenon lights, sunroof you would be looking at a 38k car. I paid 31k for my RDX and feel it was the bargain of the century! Especially after considering a RAV4 v6 which the dealer wanted 28k for and it does not even compare to the Acura."
acura,rdx,2010,Robert McGuire, 11/14/2009,2010 RDX (AWD),pos,"I have only had this vehicle for two weeks but I have enjoyed it very much. It is fun to drive, has the power I need when merging on to the highway and I love when the turbo kicks in. Not very pleased with the road noise and you feel every bump,  that's something that my wife and I both agree on. The road noise you can get use to but the bumps are another thing."
acura,rdx,2010,raza, 11/17/2009,RDX 2010 SH-AWD with Tech,pos,Absolutely best car I ever drove. All wheel drive is a blast to drive in the rain and snow... the tech in the car is amazing. The only downside is the gas mileage getting about 17-19 on highway.  Probably needs to break in some more. Pretty quick for a 4 cylinder. Seats are very comfortable. 
acura,rdx,2010,Maria, 12/12/2009,Not Bad for a 1st time SUV owner,pos,"I have owned this car since August 2009.  I got it using the Cash for Clunkers program.  I am overall pleased with the car.  The gas mileage could be better but it is a 4cyl. turbo.  I used to have only 6 cyl. vehicles and this car is faster than what I used to own.  I wish we could use regular gas.  It is fun to drive, handles the road well, great technology and love the heated seats.  It suits the needs of my small family and I also did not want a large SUV being that this is the first time that I have owned an SUV."
acura,rdx,2010,Acuraman, 01/07/2010,The good just got better!,pos,"This is the second RDX that I have owned.  Acura has done an excellent job in this mid- model change improving those areas of complaint by owners of the 2007-2009 models, such as road noise, braking performance, ride stiffness, etc."
acura,rdx,2010,Bill, 03/09/2010,Awesome,pos,"This is the second Acura I have owned, the MDX being the first. All things considered it is the best small SUV on the market period. I looked at them all- BMW, VW, Audi, etc. As long as you are not looking for a troop transport it has plenty of space."
acura,rdx,2010,Les, 03/20/2010,Better than a Lexus?,pos,"Prior to buying this vehicle, I researched the Lexus RX 350, the Volvo XC 60, the Audi Q5, and the Ford Escape. I test drove the Volvo. Most of these vehicles, are over $40,000, plus tax and license, and that is w/o many of the amenities that come standard with the RDX. The RDX interior is very nice. It is functional and user friendly. The bluetooth is very easy to set up and operate. The rear view mirror has a back up camera. It is amazing how much you get for under $32,000. I am still waiting to see how the gas mileage is going to be. My Lexus IS 350, got about 19 miles a gallon. If I can get that, I'll be happy.    "
acura,rdx,2010,Jeanie, 03/20/2010,Fun SUV,pos,"What a fun SUV! I've owned my RDX for 2 weeks now. Got it to replace my Toyota Sienna minivan in order to downsize with one of three kids now off to college. It's a smaller car for me, and I haven't traveled in yet yet with luggage, but so far I love it. VERY fun to drive. Unbelievable pick- up and handling. Comfortable. Easy to learn controls on the dash.  My one negative is the stiff bumpy ride. I'm used to a carlike ride, so learning to tolerate the bumps will be a challenge. Also, when using the bluetooth and ipod on my iphone, the ipod sound will not work. I've got to figure that one out soon!"
acura,rdx,2010,tom w, 07/01/2010,Just Perfect For Us,pos,Can't tell you how much we like this car. We looked and drove many others before making our choice. It is the wife's car but I find myself making excuses all the time to drive it. Very fun to drive. Just like a go kart on take off. A lot of bang for your buck. Ours is black and we get a lot of people looking and asking about the car. It looks great. The people a Acura were very nice to deal with also. We leased and found the $0 down lease deal to be one of the best offered anywhere. My wife only puts about 10k a year which is what's offered in the lease. You can pre-buy extra miles which is smart if you drive a lot. If you put more than 12k a year you should purchase the car not lease.
acura,rdx,2010,Chuck, 02/23/2010,Shop around for best prices,pos,I recently purchased the Acura RDX front wheel drive with technology package. Excellent car alot of power for a 4cyl. Interior controls are very accessible.  The handling is very good for a SUV.  The sound system is really good.  Overall I love this vehicle would definitely recommend to friends.
acura,rdx,2010,Jonathon Wacek, 08/30/2009,Great Sports Car,pos,"When looking at crossovers it was hard to find one with design, reliability, and power.  My wife wanted a CRV but I was not impressed with the small engine (166 hp for a big vehicle).  I tried to convince my wife about the RAV4 with a V6 engine but she didn't like the style.  We found the Acura and I believe it is a great compromise (250 hp!!).  Great power and reliability I wanted, with the looks and feel she wanted.  To my surprise it was only $2,000 more than a loaded CRV or RAV4 after neg.  We have had it for about a month and my wife loves it.  I am not impressed with the gas mileage.  With a prius 17-19mpg hurts. As a crossover it fits our wants but we don't use it for towing or haul."
acura,rdx,2010,Charles, 05/11/2010,Great around town vehicle,pos,"This car is a blast to drive.  I'm a long time Acura MDX driver and the RDX is a lot more fun in daily highway/city driving.  When I'm not cranking up the turbo, I seem to average about 23 mpg with the 2-wheel drive."
acura,rdx,2010,Renaki, 05/17/2010,Excellent Value,pos,"Finally we decided on the Acura RDX. After test driving and debating over 13 different suvs this was the winner in the end.  The choice came down to a balance of value, creature comforts, and performance.  With the deal we received on the RDX it's hard to find another vehicle in the same class that offered up the comfort of the seating, the rear cargo room (61 cubic ft), the technology niceties etc for the price.  I was shocked at how comfortable the seats were after riding in the vehicle all weekend and the audio features are excellent.  Fuel economy is my biggest gripe and it would be nice to have some reclining seats in the back like other competitors.  All in all this is an excellent car"
acura,rdx,2010,ezma, 09/25/2013,Overpriced so-so SUV,neg,"I hoped the turbo is fun to drive. In order to get a car like this, performance is a must, but it doesn't. Use premium gas plus high priced in maintenance, this car is failed to qualify as a luxury SUV. The NAV is the worse one on market. I don't even want to use it because the lack of touch screen. To operate the NAV feel so dump. Turbo kick in is similar to the down shift gear. Bit just too slow. I would say even RAV4 V6 is way better than this junk. So this is a way overpriced with really bad performed SUV. 2010 to 2012 are the same. 2013 and later changed to V6 but no more SH-AWD. I don't see what's the position of this SUV."
acura,rdx,2010,momof2, 09/07/2009,Not worth the money,neu,"I bought this car due to cash for clunkers.  I think I would have like this car better had I not driven or knew about the Tiguan (no inventory available).  No rear air vents, back seats don't move, sunroof is weak and virtually no power outlets (1).  Luxury is a far reach for this car.  All the thought was put into technology rather than make the vehicle functional.  The dual air zone is for the front seats...I guess they don't think anyone will sit in the back as if the back seat is just decoration.  The vehicle does drive smooth and has great control but cabin noise is another ""non luxurious"" characteristic."
acura,rdx,2010,geohov, 11/03/2009,Great sports car,pos,"This vehicle handles better than any car I've ever owned.  It does have a hard ride though.  My friends think it was over $50k.  Quality is first rate. It's my wife's car, but I take it for a ride whenever I can."
acura,rdx,2010,sea_level, 11/29/2009,"Fun to Drive, but...",pos,"I love how it handles and it is a blast to drive.  It is a pleasure to drive on long road trips.  The GPS, XM and Bluetooth work well, especially for handsfree phone calls. It has plenty of power and the AWD makes corners fun.   However, it has a firm to rough ride and lots of engine noise especially at low speeds.  The tone of the engine sound reminds me of a very low-end econo car, not something that costs in the high $30's.  The leather used on the seats seems sort of low quality, along with the carpet.  The seats are extremely comfortable though.  Overall, I do think it is a very good little SUV and will probably be very reliable for many year.  It just has a couple of drawbacks.  "
acura,rdx,2010,Sandra, 03/04/2010,RDX Review,pos,"I'm a first time Acura purchaser in her 50s.  I reviewed several SUVs of this size and type (including BMW X3) but the RDX kept coming to the top of my final list.  And I'm really happy with my choice, it was the right one for me.  I  really liked both the test drive and the time the dealership spent on answering my questions. Its a very comfortable ride, and I ride high up, which I like.  I feel very safe in my car and it gets me where I need to go.  I've only had it a month and have more to learn about its many features (the tech features are amazing), but it will come in time.  "
acura,rdx,2011,Carguy, 08/12/2015,Nice Comfortable Turbo Crossover,pos,"We have a 2011 RDX base FWD...as a driver,very comfortable seats,easy to read gauges nice panoramic view with low dashboard... easy to get in and out.. a blast to drive when you spool the Turbo,lots of torque but beware if you keep spinning the tires (burnouts) front driver side axles might go out easily, you would notice a vibration on low speed acceleration,will go away when coasting... this problem is only on FWD models between 50-70k miles when ABUSED(easyfix)  You NEED to use synthetic engine oil religiously on schedule for the turbo bearings and seals to last long (all turbo engines) ..otherwise you will start to have leaks from your turbo. You just have to be mindful of your scheduled maintenance and not to abuse it's power otherwise with over 90k miles now we love our RDX no problem whatsoever.....with a small growing family moving to the burbs we sold our Lancer EVO and Subaru WRX for an RDX and an RX.... I would recommend the RDX to my family and friends....you get a lot of car for your money.   This is the ONLY Acura that the Shield front grill is actually functional as an air intake hood scoop for your top mount intercooler. If you are buying a used RDX make sure you check it's history,all original stock meaning no modification has been done,if buying from a private party it is worth to pay a 3rd party to inspect the mechanical condition of the car,if buying from a dealer make sure you can get an extended warranty.. Since the Turbo RDX is no longer in production and if you do not want a used vehicle the KIA Sportage SX (SX ONLY) would be a good car to consider .......  Thanks for reading... Happy Motoring!

acura,rdx,2011,thumper16, 04/11/2011,4 Wheeled Vette,pos,"Haven't had this thing long, but what a step up from an underpowerd Honda CRV. Handling, power, fit and finish, all first class. Don't buy it if your looking for smooth. It is sportscar all the way. Drove the Infinity, Benz, and Lexus, all 10 grand or more expensive. I'm 6'2"" and have plenty of room. Acually bought it for my wife and we arm wrestle for the key. If they could make this thing get 30mpg's it would be just about perfect."
acura,rdx,2011,farrellg, 06/04/2011,Mostly Up,pos,"Mostly a good experience, but small cargo capacity, small place for driver's stuff.
Backup camera not good in bright sunlight.
Nice drive with turbo and shifting, but poor mileage + uses high price gas.
With Honda/Acura reliability, it should be very good.
Would make changes in seating.
Hard ride for all.
Guess the MDX might have been a better choice.
Should get better mileage."
acura,rdx,2011,njrdx, 04/16/2015,Nice certified off-lease ride,pos,"Purchased my 2011 as an off-lease Acura certified SUV.  Got it for just under $23k with 30k miles and warranty good until 65k miles.  

Bought it Fall of 2014 and used it thru a tough winter, the SH-AWD was great!    Has  36k miles now so have had it enough time to get very familiar.   Do a mix of local and highway driving and it handles both well.   With the rear seats down, plenty of room to haul things, the dog, etc.  

This is a good used car buy if all  maintenance  and servicing has been done.  Turbo engines need on time oil changes.   Buying as certified used from Acura is a good way to make sure this is the case. "
acura,rdx,2011,KP, 11/03/2010,Fun to drive,pos,"So far, so good! Moved up from CR-V. The Acura has been fabulous to drive, very quiet and smooth. Interior is much more practical than CR-V and easier to adjust various things, and the engine/pick-up goes w/o saying. Exterior seems nice, get lots of compliments.  Looked at Q5 and X3, for the money I think I got the best deal.  Only complaint is the gas mileage. Yes, it is turbo charged, but a combined mpg around 23 would be more reasonable for a 4cy. On 5 tanks I get b/w 18-25mpg with 60% highway/40% city driving and not engaing the turbo charger as hard/often. Most weeks are lower end of range 18-20mpg.  OEM tires seem OK so far, won't know for sure until Winter hits."
acura,rdx,2011,JAMES, 10/21/2010,RDX Review,pos,"This car looks small and drives like a small car but interior/cargo space is plenty.  I am 6'2 and i have plenty of rooms to spare. Acceleration and handling is great and coming from Civic Si and evo IX, this car definately deserves the title of sportiest CUV in the market.  I opted for AWD without the technology package and it has everythingy. I cannot justify the price of $3000 on navigation.  Overall, excellent vehicle with great value."
acura,rdx,2011,jps1010, 10/26/2010,Good value,pos,"After considering a number of different vehicles I finally narrowed it down to the RDX, the Nissan Murano and the Audi Q5.  I thought the Audi was the nicest of the trio but the price and the long term reliability concerned me.  The Murano was also very nice, however, I have heard there have been numerous problems with the CVT transmission.  I believe the Acura gave me the best bang for the buck due to their proven reliability, 4 year warranty and convenience of getting a loaner in case anything significant is wrong with the car."
acura,rdx,2011,tpf1979, 02/04/2012,Huge bang for the buck,pos,"With BMW, Audi, and Mercedes getting all the attention in the luxury crossover market, the RDX is too often overlooked. I have owned my 2011 RDX base (front wheel drive) for 8 months and love it. You get a lot for your $30,000. Stellar acceleration and handling, all the creature comforts, and a premium feel (though not quite as ""premium"" as the German competitors). If you want to save a few thousand dollars and still get an excellent vehicle- give the RDX a long, hard look before jumping into that BMW.
If you do not live in Alaska or extreme north east, consider front wheel drive for even a better value. I live in NJ and am getting through the winter just fine with my front wheel drive RDX."
acura,rdx,2011,Siva, 10/08/2010,Great Car-SUV,pos,"I love this one - I have been dring Honda Civic, Accord, Odyssey, Ford and others Tried Pilot, New Odyssey, Sienna, Routan, BMW X3, MDX and finally went with RDX Unbelievable feeling Drove - 600 miles around houston - local + highway - avg 21mpg"

Very reliable vehicle so far, but not one bringing home awards and has squeaks and rattles all over.

Bought a 2011 Certified RDX Tech Package less than two weeks ago.
Not many sold, so I consider them the few, the unknown vehicle.
Very comfortable seats.
Toys galore that I have to concentrate on the road when driving.
Just a much different driving experience than what I am used to.
Yes, the suspension is much firmer, but taking a corner is fun.
I don't slam on the turbo, as I do see how it eats gas.
If you don't slam turbo, I just averaged 25.5 mpg according to computer. "

Worked with the two Internet guys at Niello Acura in Sacramento. Both of these men made it so easy. Emailed what I wanted. Got a quote back. A few back and forths, a test drive and only 1 hour of office time. 
 
Found setting the c/c and varying gears (3,4,5,4,3...) using s mode is a great way to allow you to varying rpm (for proper break-in) while keeping the same speed while crusing the hiway. 
 
We are very happy with the RDX and the great price we got.

She Pick the Acura and I went down and got it. I think it was good decision as it is upscale and I needed to treat myself to something more than another Toyota. Reliable, safe, fun to drive, and that Turbo 4 is nice change of pace. Fuel economy is about what I expected around 18-19 range city. It uses premium fuel.

The staff and ammentites at the dealership were on par or better than many of the more expensive options.
My dealer Phuong Davidson took her time and thoroughly explained my vehicles features and options even after I bought it and was professional and patient.

It is not. Since buying the car and driving it, I'm having difficulty parking it. I can see over the hood, but something about the front end--length?-- causes me parking problems. Seat height limited--needs another 1-2"". Seat belt doesn't lower where attached and cuts me across the throat.
Passenger seat does not go up and down; husband needs a high seat to enter the car due to back problems and now has a difficult time getting in.
Would not have bought the car had I been aware. No push button to lower rear door--have to stand on tip-toe to grasp the handle.

Have about 3K in miles so far, average about 19 to 20 in town driving. The ride is a bit stiff, but NVH is good. Have owned 4 Volvos, the RDX is much more compliant with impact harshness than any of my Volvos. Yeah, I hate the beak front end, but at least is does not look like the Nissan Joke, I mean Juke. Most Japanese cars lack the sense of design when to BMW or Mercedes."

Hyperactive turbo charger fully engages at the slightest touch.  Tranny needed to be replaced at 45k miles - Japanese engineering, this is where you've ended up?  gas mileage is beyond bad for a 4-banger.  Both front windows are loose/rattle.  The interior controls are so complicated as to feel like you are on camera and the joke is on you.  Only feature i can really commend is the handling, which is excellent.  However, ultimately this just feels like a new concept (small crossover SUV) that was done quickly, and thus poorly, which may explain its utter lack of marketplace acceptance

I absolutely love driving the RDX!
It's peppy, has a lighter, crisper feel, and I love the interior, which has very comfortable seats.
No complaints from me.
This has turned out to be a very good choice.

I would compare this to a Lexus RX350, it's a little smaller, but about $9K less.

For one thing, the V6 just shines...it instills confidence and I actually look forward to driving.
Try drive up a hill in the RDX and you will understand it's capabilities.
Secondly the technology for value can't be beat.
I recommend going for the technology package if you can afford it. You
get a very convenient power lift gate and an awesome 410 watt sound system which plays music in all sorts of ways (CD, DVD-Audio, XM radio, Bluetooth, Ipod)"

Traded my '07 MDX for better gas mileage and because I only used 3rd row twice last year. The RDX is so much better than the Lexus RX that I was considering. RX may have a few more options but the Lexus RX ride is ""mushy"" compared to the quick and nimble Acura RDX. My husband, who drives a BMW 535i, LOVES my RDX - he always wants to switch cars!
The RDX is roomy yet sporty; super smooth, agile and quick. We have 3 kids and they fit comfortably in the back seat (my oldest is 5'7""). I would have like one more option pkg (heated steering wheel, heated 2nd row seats, wood grain trim) but not a deal breaker. We are very happy for the value of the RDX for the price. "

On the 2013, these two issues have been 100% corrected & it's a far more comfortable vehicle to drive. The V6 performance is more than adequate, handling is stable & it's fun to drive. A few features I'd like to have are missing on the base AWD but I wasn't willing to spend the $3400 more for the Tech package when I don't need the navigation system. Compared to the BMW X3 or Q5, I'm pleased with the value I got here & lots of extra comfort features are included. Way to go!"

I was looking for a smaller SUV that was fun to drive, had good gas mileage, the right amount of space, a bit of luxury, and was priced right.
After the first 60 days, I'm convinced the RDX was the best choice.

The RDX offers good styling, a luxury interior, a very peppy ride, quiet inside, and a relatively smooth ride.
I wouldn't consider the handling as sporty, but this isn't an Acura TL either.

It is definitely a must-test-drive if you are in the small to mid size SUV market and willing to spend $35-40k. It matches up well against the X3, Q5, even Touraeg. 
A word of warning - do not test drive if it is out of your price range. If you are considering a CR-V or Rav 4 and don't want to add $10-15k, don't make yourself miserable."

Pros:
Great mileage (28 mpg on the road), comfortable ride, good acceleration, good audio system, good dash/control layout, great ergonomics.

Cons:
Interior finish uninspiring, fit and finish from factory not in the same class as other luxury brands, rear hatch can only be opened with dash control after all the doors have been unlocked. 

We've had the car in for two fit and finish repairs.
It took the dealer three tries to a problem with the front bumper cover coming loose from fender (dealer didn't want to replace broken cover).
Then the passenger roof rain gutter molding was loose, causing a horrible vibrating noise."

It's super comfortable, quiet and has a stable ride on all kinds of roadways.
On extended interstate trips I get over 30 mpg.
The back-up camera is fantastic.
There's excellent space in front, back and cargo area.
All the basics are well done: it's a great value.
So, what's not to like.
The onboard navigation system is effectively useless.
Too dated and too many basic destinations not in the database--or not findable.
Voice recognition just doesn't stack up even if you can remember the hundreds of commands and proper syntax.
And you can't make adjustments to the route while driving.
I now use my old Garmin portable GPS."

It's also not a floaty car, if you want that, go with a Lexus, or '70's-'80's Cadillac.
Despite my very heavy lead foot, averages 21 mpg in heavy city/stop & go driving.
This is not a CRV as another commenter/troll said, who clearly does not own any RDX.
Uses premium gas, don't listen to a) the sales guy or b) someone who thinks they know better that the teams of engineers that designed it.
Brakes are a bit touchy.

acura,rdx,2013,Sandy Robins, 09/02/2015,BUY A LEXUS INSTEAD!,neg,"I have owned this car for 1 1/2 years. Soon after purchasing had to have the back shocks replaced (under warranty). The dealer claimed to know nothing about shock problems but the other 4 people that I personally know that have this car have had to have their shocks replaced as well, some more than once.

Recently my A/C quit working without incidence or warning.  When I called the dealer where I purchased the car I was told ""maybe a pebble jumped up and put a hole in your condenser"". I dismissed this as very unlikely as I had never heard of such a thing in my 40 years of driving nor did I hear, see or run over anything.  Well he was right and since caused by road debris would not honor the warranty.  Repair $750.  I researched this issue and found that Honda/ Acura had a previous class action suit settled in 2010 for 38.5 Million FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS!!!!!!
 Suit claimed placed  where road debris can hit it easily and thin metal was used. Said ""Parts that fail and they know it"". 
My husband called Acura Customer Service which is apparently a joke.  Explained we owned a Honda Pilot and CRV previously and purchased the RDX and TSX to upgrade to a premium car. Again a joke. They refused to fix under warranty or even discount the repair at all. Apparently no concern that we have purchased 4 vehicles. NOT ANYMORE!!!!
They apparently are still having A/C condenser failing issues. Any of you Attorneys want a class action?

1000 miles now on my AWD RDX and loving it.
Ride is incredibly smooth, quiet and relaxing (better than Q5).
The last poster who says it rides rough doesn't own this car and probably hasn't even driven one.
If there was a problem here, at least one professional reviewer would have mentioned it.

Handling is really impressive too. Q5 is better, but seriously, how often are you driving slalom courses? I've hit 32MPG twice in highway driving vs 27MPG expected."

Disappointed in gas mileage.
Sticker states estimated 20 city and 28 hwy.
My first tank of premium fuel with combined 60 miles of hwy driving and the rest city only got 17.5 mpg.
On my 2nd fill up I traveled to the dealer & back today approx. 120 miles hwy & it shows average of 23mpg.

While competitors such as the X3, GLK, and RX 350 probably exceed RDX on many or most parameters, a comparably equipped car from those manufactures is $6,000 - $10,000 more expensive. 

If you are considering a loaded mainstream SUV brand (such as the CR-V EX-L), then you owe it to yourself to put the RDX on your shortlist. For about $5,000 - $7,000 more, you get better engine, aesthetics, reliability, build quality, luxury features such as keyless entry and brand cachet. "

The RDX has flaws that I can over look but the wind noise from the doors and b pillars is simply unforgivable in a vehicle in this range. The dealer has done what it can but they cannot redesign the vehicle. Acura must be aware of this issue and I believe is simply choosing to ignore it.

acura,rdx,2013,rjxg, 01/22/2014,"Well rounded car, Navigation is substandard",pos,"I have been driving my RDX AWD w/Tech for 7 month now and really like the car.
Plenty of power and I find it to be a great value for the cost.
My only issue with the car is the poor quality of the navigation system.
It is like using DOS commands on a PC.
A million things to remember and it take 5 minute to enter an address.
I am shocked Acura put it out there for use like this.
Otherwise the car is good but it is hard to overlook a Navi system so frustrating I don't even us it unless I have no other choice."
acura,rdx,2013,tnuzzi1, 02/22/2014,If I had known then what I know now,pos,"I have had my RDX for 1 year and 19,000 miles.
After the first few months of owning it i noticed a vibration between 2nd and 3rd gear and 4th and 5th gear.
I brought the car to the dealer and had a technician ride with me so I could point it out.
The vibration, the dealer stated, is due to the deactivation of cylinders and that it is minor with no fix.
This is not minor when you spend many hours driving.
A vehicle that is considered a ""luxury"" suv should not be vibrating.
The gas mileage is not as stated.
I average around 19mpg.
I drive about 50/50 highway/town.
The dealer replaced my bluetooth mic but that did not improve.
I can hear fine, people have a hard time understanding me.

As a follow up to this review.  I sold my RDX, couldn't stand it!
"
acura,rdx,2013,marky1020, 01/15/2013,Great well equipped SUV.,pos,"Have had it for 1 week now and so far, so good.
Drives exceptionally well and is more car-like then SUV like.
 Traded in a 10 year old Hyundai Santa Fe which I felt was a bit of a choppy ride.
Also had a Jeep Cherokee 15 some odd years ago which was totally truck like based on its 4x4 platform.
Of the 3, the Acura feels like driving a car while still having the benefits of riding higher, hauling more when needed and having AWD. Of course you can get AWD on some cars, but my feeling is that once you start driving an SUV, it's hard to go back into a car..not impossible, just hard."
acura,rdx,2013,plmrdx, 05/25/2013,BASE RDX IS EXCELLENT,pos,"The RDX is worth the $35-40K price compared to other luxury SUVs. The ride and performance of the 2013 model is excellent--see Consumer Reports. However, the Navigation Sys. is not worth the price. Unless you are an audiophile, the Tech Pkg. is not worth $4K. Buy it without, then get a good Garmin GPS of $100+. You will like it better.
"
acura,rdx,2013,eastbaysteve, 06/30/2012,Perfect at the price,pos,"I drive 30k per year and go through a lot of vehicles. Comfort, performance and reliability are all critical for me. This car covers all of them - best for the $ by far."
acura,rdx,2013,chips9509, 09/10/2012,Great 2nd Generation RDX,pos,"The V6 / 6 speed transmission in the new RDX is outstanding - quiet, smooth, fuel economy is very good, and it does not have to down shift on every hill. An excellant combination of power and fuel economy.
Had 3 passengers on road trip to football game and all commented on ride quality, and how quiet it was.
Considered other SUV's in this class, 2013 RX, GLK, and others. Some were a little larger, most had more useable space behind rear seats, but were also many $1000's more. If you want a Premium SUV of this size, dollar for dollar this was simply the best choice."
acura,rdx,2013,cohermit, 05/31/2012,Excellent Value!,pos,"Acura has put in alot of effort to make this thing fun to drive.
It has plenty of power to go fast or you can throttle down to conserve fuel.
I have fill up this car 4 tims and average over 25 MPG (from real calculation).
 I also own a honda pilot.
And I have to say this RDX's second row is just as spacious.
Aside from all the quality others already mentioned I feel this car is a great value.
I have cross shopped and test drove X3, Q5, XC60 and GLK.
Any of those car equiped to this package will be $7000 to $15000 over.
Some might have a frew extra features, but the bottom line to me is, does it beat Acura reliability?
 Always thoughtful accesories no other brand name car will offer."
acura,rdx,2013,spottedone, 07/10/2013,Good vehicle but lacking,pos,"I have had my RDX for over a year and 17000+ miles. Overall I like the car especially when I was averaging 23+ mpg. Over the last several month my mpg has dropped to 21, still not bad. I have had it to the delearship for a full synthetic oil change. I also had to pay for a front wheel alighment which was needed. I have upgraded my gas to Chevron on their advice but it has not made a difference.
I noticed that the 2014 MDX has the same mpg ratings and now has touch screen controls which I miss on my old Pioneer flat panel. I also agree that I do not feel like I am riding in a luxury car.
One serious problem which I took to the dealer was tire slippage when turning from a stop. "
acura,rdx,2013,riathediva627, 09/20/2012,The 2013 RDX is fantastic!!,pos,"Ride Quality: The RDX rides smoothly and has a car-like feel. It has a firm, but luxurious feel.

Performance: The engine has pickup. The engine sounds solid and pleasantly aggressive.

Interior:
The interior is luxurious, yet sporty. The leather is soft and of good quality. The interior is roomy-even for a tall person! The sound system is awesome! The backup camera has 3 views which ensures that you see stuff very well. The navigation system is very intuitive. The car sets itself based on the key in the car (ex. Driver 1 key shows all Driver 1's radio presets and adjust seats to Driver 1's presets). Windows are tinted nicely. The Hard Disc Drive that records CDs is great! Listening to music"
acura,rdx,2013,vegasmurano, 11/11/2013,Review update,pos,"After 8 months or so with my RDX AWD tech these are my thoughts.
My gas mileage stinks, I am averaging about 19 all around . But to be fair I live and work on Las Vegas BLVD and the traffic and amount of traffic lights are insane.
No storage for my jumper cables or any cubbies to hide stuff.
Gas tank way too small, needs another 2 or 3 gallons in size.
Navi works good but it takes 5 minutes to tell the navi what to do, and it does not understand street names and you need to repeat it 5 or 6 times quite often.
Cornering is no BMW but it is much smoother riding but still competent.
Acceleration is amazing, but it will empty your tank fast if you enjoy it."
acura,rdx,2013,Doug Sabo, 07/05/2018,2nd RDX I've owned,pos,"Overall a nice SUV, not too big but large enough to handle most of the things that come up when you own a house and have a lot of DIY projects.  It's a nice balance of something sporty yet an SUV.  It handles well for what it is, the V6 engine has plenty of power to handle itself in traffic while still being fun/sporty to drive.  I do wish it was a little quieter on the road and it really needs air vents in the backseat for passengers.  Overall a good blend of functionality and sport in a mid-size SUV.

Well after 3 plus years I recently traded it in on another RDX, 2016 this time. I drove everything under the sun from a ChevyvTahoe to an Audi S4, and an Audi Q5 to a Toyota Pathfinder to an Infiniti Q60 and ended up back with the RDX. Best combination I found of flirting to balance a mid-size SUV to something that's fun to drive short of spending almost twice as much on a Porsche Macan
"
acura,rdx,2013,cyclistman, 06/28/2012,A great choice!,pos,"This car/crossover rocks. I've got 1700 miles on it, with no problems whatsoever (it's an Acura). I researched the Q5, X3, a quick look at the XC60, and briefly considered the RAV-4 V6. Glad I went with tech. The car was the best ""package"" for me - a great blend of performance, luxury, comfort, utility. For the most part (and I'm picky), it's got all the features I wanted in my next car, and it continues to impress me with the ride quality, power on delivery, fit and finish, interior quality, awesome sound system with the tech package. The ergonomics make sense to me, the size is roomy, but not big. Loving the gas mileage! I highly recommend it, and aim to keep it for many years. "
acura,rdx,2013,nwjgoodguy, 07/23/2014,My 2013 RDX Tech,pos,"I've had my 2013 RDX since January, purchased used with 30K, got a great deal and it looked brand new.
Prior to my Acura I had a Honda Accord V6, amazing car, then purchased a 2008 Lexus IS250 and what a nightmare!
Car was beautiful, eye catching, but at 30K engine oil rings and pistons needed to be replaced, car was burning oil, fortunately all covered by Lexus!
Once the car hit 100K and after several repairs it was time to unload and get back into a reliable Honda/Acura!
My next car will be an Acura again!
As I read reviews people complain about this attractive SUV, what most people don't see if the reliability of Acura's and overall value!"
acura,rdx,2013,jtwi, 09/01/2012,Quiet and smooth-hardly,neu,"Read all the reviews I could get my eyes on months before the purchase.
All said quiet and smooth ride.
Test drive seem to follow suit.
I have almost 3K on the car.
Every bump I hit, I hear and feel.
 I'm not talking about potholes, I am talking about road bumps which has me questioning the suspension. Inside you hear the bump-bump bump-bump bump bump.
Or maybe I am missing the cabin accoustical material.
Can't have people saying the car is quiet and smooth and i get just the reverse."
acura,rdx,2013,spottedone, 02/14/2013,Meets my expectations,pos,I have close to 11k miles on my RDX. I wanted an SUV that was fun to drive and yet got better gas mileage than my 2011 Highlander. I know I did not need the size of the MDX. I call my RDX my high performance sports car. The gas mileage has met my expectations. I mainly drive in the city and am averaging 23-24mpg. The only complaint I have is the tires losing traction while turning from a stop. This makes me wish I had opted for the AWD. I believe that the naviagtion system is too cumbersome having to press too many buttons. Further the car designers could have opted for more flair. The RDX is rather bland.
acura,rdx,2013,average_joe3, 07/24/2013,Lack Of Ride Comfort,neg,"They disregard the new car warranty. I bought a new RDX six months ago and it has 5,000 miles. This so called luxury vehicle bounces more than a Magic Mountain ride, even in flat surfaces. The service technician agreed that it has a rough ride, yet the dealer did not even put it in a hoist to check if the suspension is loose. I get a headache every tim I drive it. Acura customer service considers the rough ride to be normal."
acura,rdx,2013,traveldr, 07/09/2013,First Maintenance Visit,neu,"The RDX with a US News Car Rating of 8.5 was chosen over other vehicles with better US News Car Ratings, e.g., Subaru Outback 8.9, Lexus RX350 8.6, etc.
 Other vehicles had better Maintenance plans (60000 free maintenance on Outback) and better interest rates (0% vs. 1.9%)
First maintenance visit -- had to come back to dealer for replacement of damaged sensor wire -- physical inspection of part shows either misassemble or installation error by tool marks on part + I purchased road hazard insurance and was still charged $185.
Car pulls slightly to right after maintenance visit - tires rotated without trueing, rebalance or road check which any reputable tire dealer would hve done"
acura,rdx,2013,briansmi, 04/13/2014,"Extremely Comfortable, Storage Could Improve",pos,"I have owned my 2013 RDX for a year and a half and have 14,000 miles on it. This is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. On long trips I can be in the car for 4-5 hours and not be stiff.
The gas millage is very good for the size of the vehicle. The VCE goes from 6 to 3 on the freeway allowing for good millage on longer hauls. If I went 60-65, I could pull 29 MPG on standard hauls (no major mountains). City/Highway combo I get 22-24.
The biggest issue I have is the poor design of the storage space in the back. When you drop the rear seats they do not lie flat which greatly decreases your ability to load the back. It creates a slant upward which makes it difficult to stack items. Given the rest of how well the rest of the vehicle is laid out, I'm not sure why Acura engineers did such a bad job when considering how to get the most out of the back. I believe this vehicle is the smallest in square footage of storage and this is the primary reason why. 
*UPDATE I have had a problem with annoyingly squeaky brakes on this car in the past few months. Their is an Acura service bulletin telling dealers to replace the front pads to get rid of this. If you do a Google search you can find it. If you own one and your dealing with this take it to the dealer and have them replace the pads, should be free of charge.

acura,rdx,2013,RWD Fan, 06/19/2018,Buying Used but Confused? Buy This Car.,pos,"This was a great ""bridge"" car and I always thought it would be a perfect 1st car for a teen or a young family because of the built-in safety and test results.  I bought a not-so-gently used low-mileage 2013 with 29k miles - but those were hard miles on this car and it took a lot of detailing to get it back to where I was happy with it. So I can tell you that the interior is VERY durable.  The base ""pleather"" seats are super comfortable and extremely durable - truly some of the most comfortable seats I've ever had.  They were punished with sand and spills and I got them back to almost new with the exception of one lipstick-like stain.  The interior carpet took a lot of punishment from the 1st owner but cleaned up almost like new.  Well done, Acura.  Smooth-shifting and quiet with the base model technology that was an upgrade for me - I like being able to select ""talk to you later - I'm driving"" option as auto response to texts.  Sometimes couldn't understand my verbal requests. Acura's AC system isn't robust (a previous Acura had the same problem) and I see mention of that on message boards so it just must be an Acura thing. More of what I loved and why I bought it: durable, good horsepower/weight ratio for quick acceleration, easy exit/entry and the back seats are HUGE for this segment and I needed this to tote my elderly parents around and put their walkers in the back.  Much better MPG than my trade-in so that was a plus.  But I traded it because I drive 200 highway miles (1-way) very quickly back/forth to see the parents and it has a C-pillar blind spot that you can't adjust the mirrors outwardly far enough to address.  And the FWD dynamics are annoying to me when turning and accelerating from a stop.  I prefer RWD but I've had a few FWD cars over the years that didn't annoy me like this one did so that combined with the blind spot AND the lack of climate control vents for the backseat passengers (really? in 2013 you can't put vents back there?) I traded it for a very nice gently-used RWD sedan. But hey, it's a great trustworthy car for particular needs and since the 2013-2018 (?) models are virtually unchanged - go buy yourself a nice USED RDX for the price you like since you won't notice much difference between the model years.  Update after having traded it 12 months ago - I still kinda miss this used RDX and will test drive the newer version for future cars to see if the things that bothered me about this model have improved.  I still stand by my recommendation.

acura,rdx,2013,busyworkingmom, 08/25/2012,"Very pleased with my first Acura, love the 2013 RDX.",pos,"I spent a lot of time researching this auto purchase.
I needed a car that I can commute in but also travel up the Utah canyons for skiing and also, take on road trips.
The 2103 RDX was the perfect fit for me--size, features, price, gas mileage and reliability.
 

My neighbors have an earlier RDX and have little good to say but when I saw the reviews and the gas mileage on the 2013, I knew I had to drive it.
Very glad I did.
I was on the verge of purchasing another car--and the RDX quickly changed my mind. It's fast enough, the interior is well designed, it looks classic so it won't be completely dated in 10 years (I keep my cars a long time!) and I love all of the features. "

Honda reliability with a premium feel. 

Overall I am really enjoying my new-to-me RDX!"
acura,rdx,2013,newro, 06/24/2014,Ho Hum,neu,"Just got rid of the Acura RDX and got and infinity QX50 with Navigation, loaded for $50 a month less than the Acura. The RDX in my mind was a Honda CRV, same tiny display that looked exactly like the Honda, the blue tooth was terrible (I came out of a TL) and it was a step backwards. The Infinity is more comfortable, better equipped and truth be told, while Acura is a step above others in a buying experience sense, the Infinity is in a class above, really first rate. I would have considered the MDX but it was way over priced. Sorry to leave Acura but honestly they have changed as a car company in my mind. The QX50 is a much better car as far as I am concerned.

acura,rdx,2013,michdes001, 01/14/2015,Do not buy this car,neg,"I don't know where to start. Interior cheap. GPS is the worst-does not even recognize state roads. Also the entry of data into this system takes impossibly long time. I have reverted to using Google maps. Voice activation- throw it out the window- does not understand a single command from someone with no accent at all. Loud interior on the road- you hear all road noise. Cant even hear people on the bluetooth on the highway because car is so loud. Bought this car brand new and wish I never drove it off the lot. My husband has 2008 TL and his GPS is more knowledgeable than mine. And, with only 30K miles on it, it already has a knock with all regular maintenance performed as scheduled. "

I walked away in April 2014, traded it for a BMW X3.
Performance: numb steering, terrible suspension (failed, under warranty), failed engine mounts producing excessive vibration, unstable at high speed. Tech package: mediocre with Atari graphics. Sunroof: constantly malfunctioning. Build quality: Terrible cheap plastic all over, exposed sound attenuating foam where the windshield meets the dash, no rear passenger vents, the poorest quality leather i've ever seen in a car, and NO dash cover under steering column (where you can feel wiring and more sound attenuating foam), Playskool key FOB, hollow doors.

Dealer replaced left wheel sensor, no more problems yet, but have lost faith.
Asked dealer for free all weather mats for my trouble / inconvience but they would do nothing for me."
acura,rdx,2013,flipmank, 09/06/2013,Very Happy,pos,I've been driving my Acura RDX AWD for about 5 months and I'm really happy with the car. Performance and comfort aside it's generally the best looking car in any crowded parking lot. Looks matter and the RDX (post 2012) looks better than most luxury SUVs.
acura,rdx,2013,madrye28, 06/30/2012,Honest 2013 Acura RDX FWD Base Review,pos,"Great overall vehicle.
Was a little nervous that they moved to electric power steering and took away the SH-AWD, but this car is SUBSTANTIALLY better than the outgoing 2012 model.
The handling is precise and the ride is fantastic....a great balance.
Fuel Economy on premium has been 23-25 MPG's on mixed city/highway use,FWD model.
Pretty stellar for such a powerful 3.5 V-6.
Overall, a fantastic vehicle.
 Even though some key features are missing (will explain later), you CANNOT get any car in this price class with this amount of standard equipment.
 Test drove BMW X3, Mercedes GLK and Audi Q5, and neither has the ride quality/handling balance that this car has, AND for thousands less"
acura,rdx,2013,pdamelio, 05/13/2012,2013 RDX FWD With Tech Package,pos,"My wife and I have been researching the RDX for about 8 weeks once I heard about the new improvements that Acura made.
We purchased our 2013 RDX FWD with Tech Package today.
MSRP is $38,020 + Destination Fee of $895 = $38,915. The invoice price to the dealer is $36,665. The inventory on these 2013 models has not built up at the dealers yet, so some dealers are not come down on the prices, but if you are persistent you can get it for much cheaper than the MSRP list prices.
I have been in contact with 8 different dealers all over Northern California via email and phone.
We ended up buying it from the dealer in our home town for $37,000 + Tax & Lic.

acura,rdx,2013,vjd2211, 10/30/2013,Tech package not worth it,pos,"Nice, elegant car but looks like suffering from cost-cutting. At 3k miles battery went (luxury car with low cost battery) - the GPS needs redesign, it looks and feels obsolete and the voice recognition does not work well - Bluetooth low voice quality.
Ride excellent - engine, tranny ok after 8k miles."
acura,rdx,2013,dorse, 06/03/2012,Basque Red Base,pos,"Very pleased to find this much power with good gas mileage.
Quality is excellent and the car looks great - I especially like the basque red.
The cylinder deactivation system is flawless - you can only tell when it is in use by watching the digital bar graph for mileage jump from 20 to 30+.
Initial impressions on gas mileage are 19-20 in pure city and 27-28 for all highway.
May get a bit better with more miles on it.
Car is too new to evaluate reliability - I gave it a 5 since my 98 acura integra has 212k miles on it and has been reliable."
acura,rdx,2013,Dean, 02/07/2017,Don't buy,neg,"The only thing that this vehicle has going for it is the exterior design. Rear shocks thump, engine vibrates, and the worse is the VCM. Many have had issues with this problem, but Acura refuses to do anything about it. Just look at resale values and you will see they don't hold their value because of this. For the price, this doesn't come close to being a luxury vehicle. My 2004 Lexus RX330 runs and drives better.

I have had Acura's since 1996 and the one that I just traded, a 2010 TL had a blue tooth that was lots better. Cannot speak a phone number unless it is tagged, makes no sense, especially when you only get 15 tags. Giant step backwards on that one. Car is very good in the snow/rain. Have never driven a Lexus or BMW X3 but I would have to say that this Acura seems perfectly fine with typically Acura build quality"
acura,rdx,2013,christopher, 01/26/2018,POOR SERVICE. Electrical drain undiagnosed,neg,"Replaced the battery after 3 years.  Seemed soon, but can happen.  After new battery, car keeps dying as battery is draining.  Dealer looked at it and told me I needed new battery cables for a mere $600.  My personal mechanic inspected them and said they were fine.  Car kept dying.  Dealer told me I needed the new cables again - so I did it.  Two days later the car is dead and won't start.  I have it towed to the dealership where they spend 3 hours determining that the Stereo Amplifier was the problem and had a huge draw on the battery.  That cost me $300 just to receive that news and for an additional $1100 I could get that amplifier replaced.  The amplifier - although only $230 at the Acura Parts Store - is located right beneath the cup holder.  Apparently, some ""liquid"" spilled through the cup holder onto the amplifier.  WHY ARE THERE ELECTRONICS located beneath a cup holder?  I submitted a request on Acura's site to talk to someone at Acura.  Three weeks later I received a call from Acura to remind me that I'm a year past my warrantee.  I wasn't even asking for them to do anything.  I just wanted to know if my experience was common or atypical.  VERY DISAPPOINTED Acura!!  I took 2 years researching cars and landed on my 2013 RDX and loved it initially.  Now I'm just disappointed.

Although I was not crazy about the styling, the car flew, handled well and the interior had a style to it. I have had the RDX for about 2 weeks now and the over riding feeling that I get is that it looks and feels cheap inside. Plastic all the way through, even the sun visors feel thin. The blue tooth is a giant step backwards from what I had in the TL, it makes zero sense. I got this car for my wife to negotiate the snow in the NE because the TL was not very good. I looked at the Murano and honestly, it is a nicer car inside. "
acura,rdx,2013,aidano2, 03/26/2013,Very good initial impressions,pos,"It's comfortable, fast, and has a good amount of room in the front and rear. Also has nice simple, but solid, cabin features. It's very good in pretty much every area -- which almost makes it feel a little boring to talk about."
acura,rdx,2013,dca2013, 09/27/2012,Shop around before buying,neg,"I've had my RDX for about three weeks and I agree with what most folks have said about the features and ride. But I was very surprised to find that the sunroof would not close. It kept stopping half way. I had to reach up pull down the wind relector to get it to finally close. There is just no excuse for this.

I had a few accessories added which so far may not have been worth it. The roof rack has a very poor fit and finish, of course that could be to the way the dealer installed it.

The cargo cover is just a bad design. It retracts like a window shade, with a hard piece that just hangs free - makes access
a problem. And even though this is a small issue, there should be no issue."

Overall impressions of the car are good, but voice dialing is a disaster.

Pre-2013

1.
Press Call-Pick Up
2. Say name

2013 (per manual)

1.
Press Voice Command
2. Say ""Dial by Voice Tag""
3.
Wait for beep, and Press Voice Command
4.
Say name.
5.
Wait for system to repeat name back and beep.
6.
Press Voice Command
7. Say ""Dial.""

Not only is the new approach slow and frustrating, in my view it's downright dangerous since it lengthens substantially the interval when the driver is distracted"

In one sentence: Acura does not belong to the club of Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes, do not compare RDX to Q5, X3 and do not read reviews that attempt to do so. 

Main complain: whoever designed this car never drove in it. I've bought top of the line model and it is missing basic features that come free in Toyota."

Ride is fine on highway if you don't encounter pot holes, small bumps or rough pavement.
Even crawling over a speed bump makes the front suspension sound as if it's coming apart.
Embarrassing if you have passengers as they will think something is broken.

acura,rdx,2013,Friendly Travel Agent, 12/03/2020,Great before 100k,pos,"We bought the car back when it was first released back in 2012. The RDX was reliable, accelerated well, had plenty of technological advancements, and had great storage space. However, the gas mileage averaged about 20-22mpg, even on the highway, which we primarily used it for. After 100k miles, we noticed that the car would get progressively more expensive to operate. The maintenance bills from the dealership became progressively more expensive, as parts had to be replaced. Perhaps we could have gone for something cheaper at an independent mechanic, or maybe a different dealership would have given us different service. Nevertheless, the overall cost of the vehicle grew to be impractical, especially for something only 7 years old. We sold it in 2019 for a Tesla Model 3, and gave it to CarMax for a $14k appraisal. Would I recommend this as a used car, given the price point? Not particularly, unless you have a plan for keeping costs low. It's a well performing car. It's very safe, and has a nice amount of technology, even for today. However, the fuel costs and the maintenance costs may not be worth spending.

acura,rdx,2014,jh16, 04/23/2014,A great choice - extreamly safe in an accident,pos,"I have had my 2014 RDX AWD tech for about a week now.
So far I have been very happy with the car.
It drives smooth, brakes well, and the transmission seems to work flawlessly.
I am most happy with the turning radius, as my last two vehicles were monsters to turn and try to park.
I also looked at the Q5, and besides the Audi being more expensive, I did not like the idea of the turbo 4 cyl engine.
I've driven an audi with a turbo before, and it seemed very inconsistent - thats something that I did not want to deal with again.

The RDX has great acceleration (and sounds pretty good too when you step on it), its too bad they hid the dual exhaust tips up under the rear bumper.
 
**Update - I totaled this car about 4 months after I bought it.  I was driving in the freeway, traveling up a grade where a car was stalled in the middle lane with no battery to power its lights.  I smashed into the back of it going around 55-60mph, that was a shock!  My passenger and I were able to crawl out of the car, more or less uninjured with just a few air bad burns on wrist / face.  We, as well as my family, were very impressed with the safety of the car.  I plan on buying another sometime in the future.

acura,rdx,2014,familyguy1, 04/01/2014,2014 RDX - Comfortable but a vibration issue ruins the fun,pos,"Purchased in late Dec 2013 and after 3 months and 3,000 miles, here's my review: 

Ride is comfortable, agility is great, suspension is fairly stiff.
Seats are supportive and comfortable (both front and rear). Sound system is great.
 

BUT... The car has a vibration issue from about 60 MPH on up.
Had the tires spin balanced, road force balanced, the prop shaft replaced... still there.
The vibration is not severe, but it's ever present and on long trips, leaves your feet tingling a bit and ready to get out.
Very annoying.

Rode with the dealer service tech, he feels it too, but says that's as good as it gets. 

Because of the vibration, feels like I made a $38,000 mistake."

A little disappointed about losing SH-AWD but a good trade off for fuel economy. New RDX looks sharper and feels roomier than its predecessor (my brother has the older model), handles corners nicely, quiet and luxurious interior, and new keyless ignition start is a plus that wasn't available in the 2011 MDX. My biggest and perhaps only complaint is that the E-break is too close to my leg! Smashed my shin into it about three times in the past three weeks that I've driven this car. Overall, a spritely and spirited vehicle."
acura,rdx,2014,patrick28212, 07/17/2013,Balanced and competent vehicle!,pos,"I purchased my 2014 Acura RDX about three weeks ago and I love it! I traded my 2006 BMW 530xi for this vehicle because the maintence costs were really adding up for me. I was looking for reliability and performance and this car has both! It accelerates well and provides great comfort. The size allows for passengers to be pampered without wasted space or bulk. Mileage is reasonable for this type of vehicle (20-22 in mostly city driving and 26 hwy at 75-80 mph). The car is a good value based on content and performance. 

Updat7/2016: Still love my RDX! Not loving the tread life of my stock Michellin tires. 38,000 and they might not make it to 40k. Otherwise all is good. Would buy one again.

Update 7/2017: RDX is a champ! Hard to match the value of this vehicle. No unusual repairs. Still looks new. Performs well. Very good on snow/ice.

Powerfull engine, luxurious interior, quiet, smooth and comfortable ride, excellent navigation. All that for at least 10k less than other 3 brands. I liked the Acura's straight forward pricing. FWD or AWD with technology package or without it. BMW, Lexus and Audi starts at the similar base, but by the time you ad few essential option packages, the price skyrockets to 50k. Audi tries to make you believe that their's is the only luxury SUV, so you should not even think to pay below the sticker price. what a joke. The Acura RDX comes fully loaded, no confusing packages and pricing. Very pleased."
acura,rdx,2014,Ben Camposano, 02/15/2016,2 years later...,neu,"I purchased this 2014 RDX AWD Base. Doing comparisons with the CR-V, RAV4, and a Forester XT, RDX had the most bang for the buck as you'd have to load up the former cars in order to match the RDX, but with less power and ride quality. But it wasn't all paradise for me when I had 4 instances of transmission slippage during Jan. 2016. Long-story short, the transmission had to be replaced due to the problem actually happening to the mechanic when he test-drove the vehicle. Also, Reno Acura did their due diligence by also warranty-replacing the rear shocks due to thumping noise that comes from the rear. Now, I bought this car since I heard/read so many reviews of their reliability. As a working student, I need this car to get me through a 1.5-hour round-trip commute to the university, and was quite disappointed to learn of the defects. Repairs aside, I'm now questioning my decision to purchase this vehicle. I'm hoping that it'll get me through college before things really fall apart, and then trade it in promptly. 

For any of you experiencing problems, do your due diligence by documenting the problem.

acura,rdx,2014,OC Mike, 03/08/2018,Ocean City Happy,pos,"I think this is, by far, the best value in luxury SUVs.  I love my Acura RDX!  I have owned it for approximately thirteen months.  Great acceleration, nice handling, comfortable ride, decent sound system, great leather, sporty exterior, beautiful interior with easy to understand controls.  Two pet peeves... the front end could be a little tighter and the trans can have some hard shifts.  Not major problems, just a comparison to other vehicles I have owned in the past.  Perfect size and great safety ratings.  My car insurance premium decreased $90/year after purchasing and replacing a lesser valued car.  Good gas mileage.  After one year of ownership, I'm still very happy with my decision to purchase the RDX and would consider purchasing another one in the future.  That said, I only put about 12,000 miles on the car a year, so it could be a while.  Good for at least 150K miles.  **** Update as of 10/19 (21 months of ownership), I still love this vehicle.  At 42,000 miles.  Just had car serviced.... No problems.  **** Updated 3/20, not much has changed at 46,000 miles.  This is just a great vehicle.  I highly recommend the RDX.

Florida resident with only AC complaint from rear seat being 'it's too cold back here'.   Only down side is NOT fault of car or Acura.

acura,rdx,2014,Vern Boyce, 04/15/2016,Too many front suspension problems!,pos,"We've owned Honda vehicles for over 20 years. MOST impressed with every one - with the exception of our RDX. We absolutely loved the car when we first saw it on the dealership lot. Never having had any major issues with the previous Honda vehicles we've owned(2 Accords and 3 CRV's), we thought we'd add a ""touch of class"" in vehicle ownership. We purchased our RDX about 2 and a half years ago, and now have doubts in our decision. MOST disappointed in that we have had one issue and then another. Our most serious complaints are that with the front end suspension!! As mentioned, in a little over 2 years, we just had our third front end strut replaced. And trust me, being a senior citizen and ex-police officer, we're NOT ones to abuse our vehicles in any way nor neglect what need be. 

As I say, other than that, it's a Honda. We love the handling, style, economy and performance. The last time we brought our RDX in for strut replacement, the dealership shared our views on our frustration and disappointment, but sadly, that's the way it goes sometimes. Therefore, now that we have our car back home and cleaned up, we'll be trading it in - for a Buick. No longer bothering with Honda. Again, it's too bad for us as we have thoroughly enjoyed MANY Honda cars and other Honda-made products(Honda Shadow motorcycle, boat motor and two 4-wheelers) but will no longer deal with the company. Calling customer satisfaction made NO difference - other than ""lending an ear"". Oh well, that's the way it goes sometimes.......

acura,rdx,2014,retired01, 08/23/2013,"Great car, Tech package a disapointment",pos,"In my opinion, the RDX is as capable as a 5-passenger SUV can get. Drivetrain is outstanding, ride and handling are very good, but if you want GPS, get a Garmin. You'll save money and prevent road rage. The tech package is designed to eliminate use, except by driver's voice, if the vehicle is in motion. This prevents use by the passenger/co-pilot unless the driver is told to ""say OK"", ""say two"", ""say next"", etc. and the voice recognition has difficulty with my voice. I say ""two"", it gives me a list of nearby ""schools"". If you frequently are a vacationing couple, save your marriage, skip the tech package."
acura,rdx,2014,todd_d, 01/25/2015,Huge disappointment,neg,"After having nothing but great experiences with our last 5 hondas, the Acura RDX was a complete disappointment. Above 60 on smooth highway, its a pretty good ride. But around town in the sub 45 range, it is horrible! Within 3 months of owning it, we had all of the struts replaced under warranty. This made no difference. I don't understand this since it is basically a CRV chassis and the CRV rides quite a bit better. I thought maybe something was wrong with this particular one, but after reading other peoples experiences on Acurazine, this is the norm. Not just with RDX, but all Acura models at this time. 1st Acura I've owned, and last! Traded it in after 14 months, 12000 miles. "
acura,rdx,2014,mountainbob, 08/08/2014,Brake Safety Issue,neg,"This problem would not be fixed by Acura.  It got so bad I sold the car for a loss, but at least I am safe. 
Mine and all 2014 models have a front end metal on metal clang going over bumps.
Diagnosed by two dealers as brake pad metal backing hitting caliper clips.
Acura will not fix, dealer has made a temporary fix. Dealers are frustrated with Acura over issue. Dealer says he does not know if this is a safety issue.
Filed complaint with Federal safety commission. Metal on metal will eventually break down.
Acura will have to fix the problem if more owners complain to dealers. This is a potential dangerous brake issue.
The clang is not something that a so called ""high end"" SUV should have. Acura calls it, ""a Characteristic"" of the model. If this is so then lower the price to a low end SUV.

I have been very pleased with the gas consumption averaging 27.5 MPG with mostly highway driving.

competitors but drives as well or better. The combo of auto and manual transmission is practical and fun. Manual downshifting on mountain roads saves on brake wear -- and with cylinder deactivation mpg can jump suddenly from 20 to 30 or even 40 with no change in sound or feel. Bluetooth and USB audio work beautifully. Seats are very comfortable and storage space is good. I upgraded from a Honda and the family resemblance is clear.

It is a good car in many respects but the suspension, interior quality and road noise reduction are less that what you expect from a ""luxury class"" SUV. The vehicle now has about 36K miles and the dealer has had to replace the rear struts twice and fix an annoying drive train vibration. I also replaced the brakes and rotors at 24K miles at my cost - Acura said brakes were not covered by warranty even with relatively low mileage.

acura,rdx,2014,kelley shimo, 06/21/2017,Disappointing workmanship and UI design,neg,"Cheap paint used on the vehicle.  Chips and scratches very easily.  Door dings and scratches go all the way to the metal.  I had a Mercedes ML320 for 19 years and did not have this many chips and scratches.

The interior placements of the air vents are ludicrous.  The air flow (summertime) from the driver's vent is unable to reach me because it is blocked by the steering wheel base and the signal/wipers levers.   I don't see how this design flaw was not noticed by Acura. I need the heat or the cool air directed toward me not my steering wheel and hands   The heat temp (winter) is slow to reach 80 degrees and needs to be at full blast to warm the front seats.  In 51 degree weather, it takes a good 10 minutes for the heater to work.  Heater set at 75-80 degrees and cool air comes out of the vents. During the summer, the AC has be cranked full blast to reach a comfortable 72 degrees.

acura,rdx,2014,Melissa P., 01/03/2018,Good not-quite-ready-for-mom-van option,pos,"I was purposely looking for something more compact for our small (one kid) family, as I prefer that to driving a larger SUV. I traded in a two-year-old TSX, which I loved, to buy the RDX so we would have more rear leg room and cargo space. I like the simplicity of buying an Acura -- get it with or without bells and whistles, no nonsense. Good value for the money. All the goodies I wanted at the time, heated seats, XM radio, etc. While previous years had a turbocharged engine, this one does not which means pretty decent gas mileage. My daily commute is a combination of city/country road driving and I hit the mid 20's most tanks. There is a bit more road noise than I remember with my TSX. And make no mistake this is definitely a smaller car. Another kid or a large dog, and you might want to consider something larger. We fill up the cargo area pretty quickly! But I do still feel that the rear legroom is better than that of other cars in this size class, and installing the car seat with LATCH is a snap.

acura,rdx,2014,newro, 12/31/2013,OK but.....,pos,"Have had Acura's since 1998, always a TL. My wife needed an all wheel/4 wheel drive that was not huge so we got out of a 2010 TL and into a 2013 RDX without the tech package.
Its nice, but its not going to blow you away. As with all of my previous Acura's, its a quality build and reliable. Quick enough but I find it a little herky jerky in the steering, but, I have a 2010 Pathfinder which is like a tank compared to the RDX. It is pretty good in the snow, which is why we got it so I suppose that all in all, it does what its supposed to. It shares a radio with the Honda CRX and from what I am told, the all wheel drive platform as well. I guess its the Acura version of the CRX."
acura,rdx,2014,padgett01, 09/14/2019,RDX AWD,pos,"This car finally stopped or revolving negative equity and big repairs.  Cost to own was very good and I was surprised at the value for regular maintenance at the dealer for tires, transaxle, brakes, etc.  My wife still likes driving this car after 150k miles in 5-years, but we need to get into a new car in-time to pay-off before our son drives and needs a car (so we don't need to drive him everywhere)... Looking to take the next step into an MDX since this RDX was so good.  Oh yeah, AWD is great in the snow (we live in NE ohio snow belt) and when I drive I have to watch speed as this thing has giddy-up, even at 150k.

acura,rdx,2014,thumper16, 06/22/2013,Very Nice,pos,"Bought this for my wife, she formally owned a 2011 RDX. The 2011 was a choppy ride but a great handler. This is a very different. It's smooth
with a more refined feel. Inside seems a little roomier. So far she is loving it. This is our 6th Acura, even so I shopped others and concluded this to be the best $40,000 mid suv out there.

acura,rdx,2014,rgf99, 12/02/2013,Bean counter had too much to say,neu,"The rdx is a great car as far as it goes.
 It simply does not go far enough.

Besides a few design flaws, weak A/C, poor interface to the iPhone, the rdx lacks many key features/options of luxury SUV.
Parking sensors are offered, nor is adaptive cruise control, ...

To add insult to injury many features that should be standard are only available on the tech model - fog lamps, power lift gate, ....

Great potential but fails to deliver in the end"

acura,rdx,2014,pr1, 09/30/2013,Acura RDX,pos,"I have had my Acura for three weeks and I remain very satisfied with my choice of the RDX. I had narrowed my search down to three brands when I arrived on the Acura sales floor in Tustin California. 

I always felt that a root canal was preferable
than shopping for a new car.

 The salesman I was put in contact with, Kevin, knew his product, easily explained the car's features and then stepped back to let the car sell itself. 

During the next few weeks I found myself back on the sales floor several times to ask Kevin questions about some of technological features. That's when I found Kevin to be as accommodating after the sale as he had been before. "

acura,rdx,2015,road_gypsy, 07/17/2014,Acura RDX is a great choice.,pos,"I was originally considering a Honda Crosstour, but also looked at the Subaru Outback 3.6r, lots of 4 cylinder SUVs, the and the RDX. My extended family has had good experiences with Hondas, but poor ones with BMW and Mercedes. 

The RDX quickly became my favorite. Didn't like the CVT and driving exp. of the Outback although it had more space. The Crosstour was felt heavier and had worse maneuverability, although real 4x4. The RDX was an instant top choice on the test drive. I like that it's fast and agile when I need it to be and saves some fuel with the VCM tech. on the highway.

The tech. package has a lot of things I don't need, but the stock AWD has some great features."
acura,rdx,2015,maryz2, 01/18/2015,Love my car,pos,"I purchased the 2015 RDX AWD, I did not buy the tech package. I did add the fog lights. I love most everything about this car. Rides very nice and is quiet this was important to me. The stereo is nice and am happy about the satellite radio.

My complaints would be no heat/air conditioning vent in the rear my former non luxury car had this. 
The mirrors hang out far on the sides really hard to get in my garage. I wish the temperature gage read larger. Overall a great purchase and my insurance did not go up. The RDX has a good safety rating."
acura,rdx,2015,raj2015, 03/20/2015,Excellent Luxury car for the price,pos,"Driving: Very smooth and comfortable and powerful

Price: Best luxury SUV for this price. I would say very less when compare to other compact luxury SUV with given options

Options: I dont want to blame that few options (like blind spot monitor) are available since i know it before buying.

But the Bluetooth connectivity for phone is very poor. When i am using bluetooth calling, the audio is very poor and other end, they hear lot of noise (like wind blow sound). I have 2012 Camry but the bluetooth phone connection is very nice.

Overall: I am very much satisfied for the price. I love my car. You can get lot of standard features in base model."
acura,rdx,2015,broka, 07/25/2014,Sometimes it is the small stuff that counts,pos,"I picked up my new RDX with technology package 5 days ago and I LOVE DRIVING IT. But there are some stupid things that should be in a car of this class.
1) The front passenger seat does not go up causing discomfort for some people and makes them feel like they are sitting on the floor.
2) There is no air conditioning vent in the rear. If it can be in smaller and less expensive cars, I see no reason why this can only have the cut out for it.
3) There is no light in the luggage compartment. That is ridiculous.

Aside from these ""small"" issues, I love the car but these little annoyances can and should be easily fixed.


Update, I have had the car now 2 1/2 years and it has 36000 miles. The car ride and performs fantastic. The seats are extremely comfortable (except the passenger seat only goes forward and back and my wife needs to sit on a pillow). I did subsequently to the original writing of this review find a light in the rear tailgate but those other annoyances still exist and are still frustrating. However in the 2016 model each of them were fixed. The car comes off lease in 6 months and I honestly do not know what I am going to do. The 2017 model is essentially the same with a few updates and fixes to the annoyances and there is a piece of me that wants something different. But on the other hand, I cannot find any fault with the car or the service of the dealership. I have spent $0 in repairs and have only changed oil and rotated tires. It performs flawlessly on the road and is a joy to drive. Tough decision!
"
acura,rdx,2015,George L, 02/04/2016,A conundrum.,pos,"First, this is an excellent car. 
Having said that, after driving the car for six months, there are a number of short comings.
Now after 5 years, these comments are still applicable. Specifically
The first is that the rear seat does not fold flat when turned down. This makes it more difficult to store stuff
Second, I would have preferred a heated steering wheel (OK, I want to be pampered)
Third the gas mileage is a bit disappointing, particularly considering that premium fuel is required
Next, the transmission down shifting as one slows down at a stop light is ragged and noticeable.
The GPS system is a bit cumbersome, and cannot be used while driving. The phone system is also a fight to use while driving. I end up calling on my phone and letting the  system transfer it to the car's system. Translated the speak while driving system is a failure 
Parts of the technology are still difficult to use, and not quite intuitive. 
Voice recognition system is at best crummy
I still think the voice recognition system is lousy and the phone system is difficult to use. In my opinion, these electronics are the worst feature 
The dealer claims that the new models are better. (Expect that from a sales person)
The seat is a bit uncomfortable. I have tried various cushions, and positions. For long distance driving, the most effectve method for me is to stop and stretch my legs. 
Drive is a bit more sporty than I would like. The MDX has a better system that lets you select 'sporty' or 'luxury'
(The MDX costs $10,000 more, and is 10"" longer. To me again, a bit pricey)
One of the reasons that I purchased the car is the dealer. 
Our local dealer is absolutely terrific, and makes up for some of what I perceive as the short commings of the vehicle
I would have preferred more storage cubby holes.
Ergonomics are average.  Every time I get in the car, I have to be careful not to hit my head on the top of the door frame
Acceleration is excellent (obviously this is an offset for the mileage)
Seats are marginally comfortable, particularly on long rides.
Stereo is good
I enjoy the ride,again, the seat is a bit uncomfortable for long trips
Every car is a compromise, and there are no perfect grades
Despite my negative comments, the car, overall, is pretty good.
I have particularly good things to say about the reliability and dealer
The all wheel drive and convenient size is a very big draw for me; it seamlessly handles wet, icy and snowy conditions, and is easy to park in the city
This is a very nice car, but is also a work in progress
After a year, I can say I really enjoy the ride, except for the seat on long rides
The only gripe I really have are the Takata air bags. This is under recall (as are several million other cars,) but nobody has any replacements. I have been waiting for over three months, but the manufacturer has not been able to supply them.  Finally did, after a year
"
acura,rdx,2015,Jonradus, 10/03/2015,Worth the Money,pos,"This car gets mpg as advertised. I do mostly highway/suburbia driving and I'm at 26 mpg. You can get 30 mpg with all highway if you're light on the gas. 

I read some suspension complaints, and I understand why they're here. The back axle is pretty rigid and clunks over rough bumps. It's the only real problem with the car I've seen so far, but it's tolerable. 

The car handles great and has a smooth, linear power delivery with more than adequate acceleration. The  transmission also shifts smoothly. The steering is a bit loose at slow speeds, but picks up heft with speed.

Overall, this is a great car for the money.

acura,rdx,2015,JD, 07/12/2018,Great Entry Luxury SUV,pos,"The RDX is a great car for a small family, plenty of space to haul a child and parents stuff and on road trips. The layout is spacious and comfortable with everything you need within reach.

acura,rdx,2015,CaBob, 05/02/2018,Almost a 5 star vehicle.,pos,"It's a comfortable, reliable car that's a decent buy for the money. Main complaint is with the air conditioning. In hot weather when in heavy traffic it cycles on and off in an effort to improve gas mileage. Air will actually blow very warm even with A/C setting at lowest possible spot. An instant read thermometer ranged up to 75 degrees blowing out of the vents at such time. The dash board lighting of the information control panel needs to be brighter. When wearing Polarized sun glasses in bright sunlight it's almost impossible to read the panel. Otherwise it's really a solid vehicle. Rides well, good acceleration and handling once you get rid of the factory installed tires and put some on that have some grip to them. Good visibility. No ongoing repair issues. Good customer service.

acura,rdx,2015,gator00si, 12/31/2014,Overall a strong segment competitor with some significant gripes,pos,Besides missing a few basic features its a great vehicle. Reliability and build quality are top notch for this segment. The design is more subjective but I like think its sporty. 
acura,rdx,2015,Bob, 04/08/2018,2015 Acura RDX,pos,"Came off 3 year lease with only 13,200 miles and like new condition. So far I really like the car. Looks & runs great.

acura,rdx,2015,colonelken1, 02/07/2015,RDX---first 3 months,pos,"After getting a great deal on the base RDX using a buyers service, I'm pleased.  Not thrilled but pleased with my first SUV.  Sitting higher is a benefit with so many larger trucks and SUVs already on the road.  I've used the RDX around town and on one long trip.  Very comfortable seats on the trip for both driver and passenger.   Lots of legroom and headroom.  The rear seats fold but its a small SUV so don't expect to move beaucoup things.  

Wish it had come with a few tech package features like automatic rear tailgate opener/closer, xenon lights, and more blindside detection but it gets great safety ratings.  Nobody uses NAV systems anymore so I'm not paying another $3k.  Solid B+.  "
acura,rdx,2015,Nick, 12/17/2015,Significantly Less Value Than Expected,neg,"First off; the technology package is a waste of money and a sad trick Acura has played on buyers. The NAV system is near worthless when programming at a standstill, it is completely worthless once you are moving down the road and the ""Technology Package"" takes you into voice mode.  The voice mode makes you spell out destinations one letter at a time and then, for each letter, goes through a long (10 second) dialog on how to choose the next letter (?). This is really a poor joke on the consumer. The voice recognition system operates with about a 50% accuracy and by the time you get the address entered, you have spent your entire trip arguing with the ""Technology Package"". Simple fix; purchase a $100 Garmin and put it in front of the useless NAV screen. The road noise, harshness, and vibration is horrible; the Honda CR-V has a much improved ride over the more expensive Acura. Handling; the body roll is annoying and feels downright unstable on twisty roads. Fuel economy, throttle response, and acceleration are dismal on the ""Multi-Point/Low Pressure Fuel Injection"" compared to ""Direct Injection"" engines found on other similar and lower priced vehicles of the same vintage and category. The controls and displays are awkward at best and are not at all intuitive. Compared to earlier model Acura vehicles, these ""technology"" systems have taken a huge step backward.  Oh, unlike the cheap Honda CR-V base model, this Acura does not include a rear cargo area floor mat.  Imagine that! 

What can I say about the car that I like... it looks good, the leather feels nice, everything works (albeit it's a new car).

I've been a Honda customer over the past 10 years, Honda makes a solid no-frills, trouble free, turn key vehicle. This was my first Acura and this will be my last Acura unless Acura gets serious about building a car to help a driver get from one place to another efficiently, easily, and with minimal frustration.  Thank God I only took out a 3 year lease on this buggy; I'll be happy to hand the keys back and tell the dealer they can find another Acura customer. 

Make sure to test drive this vehicle thoroughly (like for several hours and over bumpy twisty roads) before signing on the dotted line.

Update as of May 18th, 2016:  This vehicle has been recalled for a faulty SRS (air bag). We received a notification, the dealer told is not to drive the vehicle until parts arrive, which are expected late summer 2016. We have been provided rental vehicles by the dealer, not Acura vehicles mind you, but typical rental vehicles. Dealer told me that I should feel blessed that they are doing anything at all. My point:  $425 a month for a bottom of the line Hyundai Santa Fe?  At this point, my mind is made up; no more Honda/Acura vehicles. Once off lease, I'll be looking elsewhere. You should consider this when making your choice on your next vehicle.
"
acura,rdx,2015,JP, 11/08/2017,Acura RDX - almost there !,pos,"Wife is completely satisfied with the RDX.  We agree on several areas for improvement.   2015 does not have vents in the console or overhead, directing heat or cool air to the rear seat passengers.  Bright trim on the console can reflect sun into drivers or passengers eyes.  Dislike the manufacturer not covering Navigation updates while vehicle is within it's warranty period.  Vehicle chassis/ suspension transmits shocks from road surface imperfections into the passenger compartment.   As with all SUV's, fuel economy is poor compared to station wagons, or hatchbacks which generally provide sufficient utility.   Unfortunately, US drivers have few choices when modest utility and sedan like fuel economy are desired.
"
acura,rdx,2015,ak07, 01/02/2015,"It's great, but...",pos,"After driving the 2015 RDX AWD for 5 months, I am happy about the car, but not thrilled for sure. It has excellent space compared to competitors and my family loves the leg space in rear seat. Great looking interior and decent mileage for a 3.5L V6 AWD. 
I was confused whether to take the tech option or not and at the end I decided to save 3.5K, which Acura was charging for the package. But now I feel I should have taken it, as the basic model miss some 'basic' features that we expect in a luxury car. Like the power tailgate, halogen lamps and fog lamps. Acura should not be selling any car without these. Its a little annoying when Honda sells Accord with more features that Acura RDX..!"
acura,rdx,2015,ML, 11/23/2015,Nice ride,pos,"Reliability of a Honda, better interior, really a great ride.  The reliability of the Audi and Volvo scared me away.  The twin turbo/supercharged engines will obviously have thier issues in time, so this feels like the right choice.

However, the BMW, cruises on the open road a bit nicer.  This starts pushing the rpm's at about 80, while the bmw will cruise up to 100 without breaking  a sweat.  There are  minor advantages to each.  Overall, I went with the reliability of the Honda brand.  At 23K miles, it has been a great decision.

Updating; at 30k miles, it is a great ride.  Perfect car for where we live and our needs.  Better car than the MDX which has better reviews,  the Lexus has no visibility and lame Toyota performance, and the Audi and Porsche will be in the shop another month before you can use them again.  Hyundai and Subaru are dangerously underpowered.  This is the easy winner.  Best car on the road imo.

acura,rdx,2015,Car guy, 07/19/2015,Buyer beware - horrible suspension,neg,"I had a 2015 RDX AWD (non-tech package) for a year. Bottom the rear suspension on the RDX is horrible.  Whenever you drive over the smallest bump on the road the rear suspension ""clunks"" and transmits the impact directly to the occupants. There's nothing wrong with the car (I had the dealer check) basically it's just poor suspension design. Unfortunately when I test drove the car it was on smooth recently paved roads - big mistake.  Search any of the Acura owner/community sites and you'll see plenty of similar comments about the 2013 to present RDX and the same issue with 2014 - present MDX and TLX. There are other quality issues/non-user friendly quirks with the RDX but the horrible suspension was a deal breaker (and ridiculous for a $36K ""luxury vehicle""). I've now sold the RDX - my first and last Honda/Acura product. Very happy with a German SUV now.
"
acura,rdx,2015,Renee, 09/27/2016,Loving this care,pos,"I bought this car with the technology pkg, it was previously leased.  Initially, I was interested only in the MDX because I thought this car would be too small; but after test driving the Audi Q5 and then this car; I realized this was the car for me.  The stereo system is great, it is so updated I didn't realize how behind I was with technology.  There only 2 things I would change - I would have liked to have a blind spot monitor on this vehicle and I would have gotten something other than black if available...now I will have to keep my car clean.

However, the disappointment is that it requires Premium gasoline.  It is reliable and dependable.  Great to drive and great features.  Disappointed that after 3 years...the value had depreciated.    Acura needs to work on improving their luxury vehicles gas type.

It has a smooth, quiet ride, great handling, excellent performance and great fuel economy (23.5 mpg avg). It also has an excellent sound system.

acura,rdx,2015,Lori, 04/18/2018,Need a button?,neu,"There is no interior or exterior button to automatically open the trunk.

Well 2 years later and I love it!! It’s perfect for me or with my kids. Plenty of space. Of course there’s a few things I wish it had, but regardless it’s an extremely safe and well priced luxury SUV. I need AWD which it has and it gets through the snow without a problem. My windows are all tinted so it gets a lot of looks and compliments.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Bob, 11/18/2015,Great overall value. Nice luxury features.,pos,"Owned the 2016 RDX for 2 months.  Bought the FWD with technology package.  The RDX has the best overall engine for small SUV.  Same engine as the MDX, but much smaller car means better performance.  Great HP for its class.  Very good gas fuel economy and uses regular unleaded gas.  Other SUV's that had similar HP were turbo charged engines that required premium gas (i.e. more expensive to operate).  Transmission is 6 speed automatic that is very smooth and shift points are perfect.  Ride quality is a little stiff, but that helps with handling.  The car is very quite when windows are rolled up.  Seats are very comfortable.  Very nice dual displays (one of which is touch screen).  Premium stereo with XM and HD FM.  I like the HD FM sound quality.  It has a 15GB hard disc so you can save CD's or transfer songs from USB stick.  There are 2 key fobs that you can customize most of the car features for each.  Seating position, radio settings, navigation settings, are just a few of the items.  Car recognize which key is closer and those settings are active for that driver.  Very nice.  Only a few negatives:  Lots of wind noise when back windows are down more than about 1 inch.  The electronics take about 1 minute to boot up when you start the car.  Does not sound like much, but much slower than my Lexus that is 8 years older.  Navigation system works good, but a little funky to set.  Sound quality is good compared to standard quality systems, but less than other premium systems.
** 2.5 years and 29K miles update.  Still very happy with the car.  No mechanical issues.  The stereo had some memory problem, but was under warranty so the dealer replaced it and solved the problem.  Really the only complaint is the slow electronics system.  Entering address in navigation system is cumbersome.  Usually just use Waze and skip the car nav system.  Other than that, the rest of the car runs perfectly.  Gas mileage still very good at 25MPG+ in mixes hwy/street driving.  Engine and transmission are strong.  No squeaks or rattles in the body.  The key fob memory is a really nice feature.  I like how seats adjust and my music stations are personalized for me when I am driving.

acura,rdx,2016,Steve K., 12/07/2015,"Test drove them all, RDX is the winner !",pos,"My wife never had a SUV and wanted one to be our next one. She has been driving an 08 awd Acura RL and loved it. We put snow tires on it for the winter and it was a tank in the snow with the SH awd. So for us to trade it in was a big deal. I started doing some research on Edmund's and started to list the suv's we should consider. I test drove over 12 myself and reduced it down to 5 we should consider. We decided to stay in the mid size or smaller range since it is just the two of us. We picked one day to test drive all 5 for comparison. The Lexus NX and RX were the first she drove. Next she drove the Acura RDX then the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe. The RDX beat them all with the 6 cylinder engine, it was by far the most peppy of them all and drove more sporty than the RX. It seems like everyone has an RX these days so they are kinda of boring to us. The RDX is full of technology which has been greatly been improved upon since we had it in our RL. The biggest is the blind spot, auto braking, cross traffic and adaptive criuse control. I have using them and they help greatly with driving. We are happy with our decision and have found acura's hold their resale value as well as being reliable. By the way, the Hyundai Tucson was our second choice, which we may buy as a second car in the future. It is about $10000 less than the RDX and has alot of the same features.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Ralph Smith, 11/23/2015,Comfortable Ride with Tech Pkg to Make Geeks Happy,neu,"I bought this car because the ride is quiet, the acceleration is excellent, the ride is comfortable, it has a very good safety rating and safety technology is state of the art. I also liked the Acura's reputation for reliability. I enjoy a good sound system and the RDX with the Advance package is among the best I have heard in a car. 

We drive a lot of miles each year on long vacation driving trips. Since the car is also used around town, the smaller size of this SUV is convenient as it rides well on a trip but also easy to park in a city.  

There have been a couple of surprises. While I knew the car had great safety features, I had not really experienced the changes introduced to my life by this car until taking it on a trip shortly after buying the car. The surprise is that it requires changing how to drive in many respects and requires a new driver for this car to adjust to the technology.

Specifically, the ability of the car to adjust its speed with the traffic. Don't misinterpret: I like the changes but on a busy interstate, one needs to pay attention to adjust to the changes. Cars and trucks pull in front of a car unexpectedly. The first time this happened, the Acura RDX slowed dramatically and automatically. I did not have to apply the brakes. Several days into this driving trip, I had adjusted and found myself becoming almost lackadaisical about this feature as the car almost adjusts itself. Driving is more relaxing. On a busy highway, I disabled the system though as the distance between my car and the next vehicle was long, even with the lowest setting, and occasionally a large number of cars would continually pull in front and constantly slow down our pace of driving.

I did not like the feature of adjusting the steering  when changing lanes or moving in traffic. I turned this feature off quickly. No doubt, I will try it again but doubt it will be useful or one that I will use with any regularity. I prefer to drive the car and change lanes as necessary without objection from the computer in the car.

My biggest complaint in an otherwise excellent vehicle is the navigation system. I don't like it or how in integrates with the other system technology. The navigation systems in previous cars are much better. The Acura system is not intuitive or designed with the driver or consumer in mind. It works with the voice control but the list of possible commands is long and ignores some of the most common features available on other vehicles.

I still do not know if I can send instructions to the car to follow a route I have created on the computer. The Acura site indicates I can do this. The salesman who sold us the car said he had never heard of that feature. A system like this works well on a Mercedes that I own. The manual is silent on on how to do it. The website offers no advice. I do not mind making a call with Acuralink to enter the destination but would prefer to map it out myself to select my own routes.

The ability to use the smartphone with the Acura's system is an excellent innovation. I also like being able to stream a podcast or Pandora through the stereo system. Sirius XM generally works well with the Acura although the traffic and weather features do not integrate with the RDX. We used those features extensively with a 2012 Murano and this lack of integration is a significant failing of a luxury SUV. There is weather and traffic information on the RDX, it is not up to Sirius.

Unfortunately, the navigation system operates in its own universe. The voice system giving directions cannot be heard clearly while sound is coming through these other systems. Instead, the systems yammers away incessantly with turns and directions while leaving the stereo system as a higher volume. Moreover, attempts to turn down the navigation system with the voice controls apparently cannot be done. At least I have not found a way to
 do this or to find in the documentation how it can be done.

In my older Murano, I was able to know when the next rest area was coming up as well as when the next exit was coming up. Not so in the Acura. Asking for rest areas results in a list of rest areas, some of which may be behind on the route being traveled or may be many miles ahead. The information is useless. 

One friend who bought an Acura said he gave up and bought a Garmin navigation system to use instead of the built in system. I now know how he felt and I am inclined to agree. The nav system in the RDX is a major disappointment. As a person who uses a system like this extensively on trips, I have already found using Google maps or Waze on my IPhone to be much more useful and easier to use. With an MSRP of $45,000 for this luxury SUV, I expected much better. Moreover, the Acura salesman was not well versed in how to use the system so learning how to use it has been largely trial and error and stopping occasionally to check the manual to see if we missed something that would make it more useful.

acura,rdx,2016,Pete Pop, 07/30/2016,Very pleased with this vehicle,pos,"This vehicle is fantastic!  I test drove a Ford Explorer, Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe and I bought the RDX with the tech package.  The reliability reviews over the others was one of the main points but after owning it I really have come to appreciate its high points.  The ride is smooth, powerful and really quiet.  The sound canceling system (like Bose headphones) does a great job. Being a musician, I was impressed with the stereo and during my test drive we adjusted the base and subwoofer to full potential and I was blown away.  The sound quality with the ten speakers in neural mode (surround sound) is amazing. Some reviewers complained about having two screens.  I prefer it and it’s much more pleasing to be able to still see your audio screen while navigation is showing on a different screen.  Brilliant!  They recommend 91 octane which basically doesn’t exist anywhere so I need to use 93.  I’m not thrilled about that but at least gas is cheap now.  I drive both highway and city to get to work so it seems I’m averaging around 19 mpg. No long trips yet to really see highway mileage. I live in South Florida and I can say that the air really cranks.  Most of the time I only have the fan halfway even though the leather seats in summer can be hot.  The advanced package has ventilated seats but will cost you at least $3500 more on your out the door price.  I passed.  The shortcuts menu, speed dial options, voice prompts and other technology is a big plus.  I went from a stupid car (Honda Accord 2007) to this so it’s like walking onto the Enterprise!  I can’t imagine anyone buying this car and not liking it.  I paid $40,000 even out the door which seems to be a pretty decent price for a 2017 with the tech package. Updated11/3/2016. I can now confirm highway mileage on a long trip at 29 mpg which is as Acura estimated.  I like this car even more now as I've been using more of the bells and whistles. I REALLY appreciate the back up cross traffic alert."
acura,rdx,2016,Stephanie, 10/28/2015,Happy w/ the 2014 RDX - Even Happier w/ the 2016!,pos,"This is my 2nd RDX. My first was a 2014, which I was happy with, despite a few minor irritations. The 2016 took care of my irritations with added technology, specifically the blind spot and rear traffic warning sensors and changes in the technology package. The RDX has two good blind spots so the new tech is fantastic and solves the issues - and works beautifully. The 2016 feels heavier and drives smoother than the 2014. The steering feels better and more substantial, as well.  It is also quieter with less wind noise and a smoother sunroof mechanism.   I did purchase a wind deflector this time though. I love the 3D navigation viewing option and the 10-speaker sound system is wonderful.  I've had Acuras since 2000 - three TLs (2000, 2003 and 2008), the 2014 RDX and now the 2016 RDX.  My 2000 TL had transmission issues, which were taken care of by the dealer even though the warranty had expired. I've always been treated well by the Dealer (in South Orange County in California).  I did not test drive competitors' vehicles, but did a lot of research on the Lexus RX, Lincoln MDX, Mercedes GL and GLK and some of the BMW and Audi SUVs, which would have fit into my budget. At the end of the day, I could not justify a higher cost for the competitors (when comparing the multitude of packages available with the competition), even though they may be more prestigious in name and perhaps more luxury interiors.  The value, quality and solid luxury of the Acura won out when I decided not to tie up more of my money and still have all the bells and whistles you get with the RDX.

10-28-2018 Update - I still love this car.  My only complaint is the Apple Car Play, which is not an Acura issue.  The connection is at time touchy and at least once a month I have to into the settings on the car and re-enable the connection, if plugging and unplugging my iPhone doesn't reset it.  Fortunately the touch pad is easy to use and I've been able to re-set the connection pretty easily.

acura,rdx,2016,Wayne selan, 07/29/2016,2016 rdx w/advance pkg.,pos,"Great ride. Dont take that as its a sports car, its not. Just a great cruiser and if you want some fun slip it to sport and use the paddle shifters. Biggest complaint is the voice regonition. Only had it a month but it takes some work to master, and i havnt , and not sure i ever will. Best way is to put in an address before you leave, trying to find a certain restaurant etc on the go gets frustrating. I get better mileage than stated which is a nice surprise. Love the blind spot detector and the backup camera is awesome, really gets a wide view which is great. I am not disappointed with this suv at all, just the oppisite. Best bang for your dollar by far. Oh yeah the seats, especially the cooled option are the most comfortable of all the higher end SUVs, at least for me. Everyone has a different butt and back but for me its like sitting in my lazy boy.

acura,rdx,2016,Debbie, 02/29/2016,Acura RDX 2016/Advance Package Red,pos,"We purchased car January, 2016 - love it - first new car in a long time and very happy with purchase even though it was on the high end of our budget.  Car is very comfortable to drive and is made well.  Technology is very easy to figure out and has lots of cool features.  Took ride up to Minnesota and ride was very stress free with cruise control system features.   Smooth quiet ride.  Some reviews state navigation system is cumbersome and at times it is, but no different then using a Garmin.   Sound system is great and love the HDD CD Drive.  Even though dealers do not deal much in price we found a much better deal at an Illinois dealer vs Milwaukee area and they were great!  Hope we get lots of years out of it and it holds it value.

acura,rdx,2016,Spark2003, 05/29/2016,RDX offers the best overall value for money.,pos,"This is my 2nd RDX. The first was approaching 10 years old original owner no problems aside from normal maintenance items. The 2016 RDX has come a long way -  is extremely comfortable fun to drive and loaded with Technology and safety features. The adaptive cruise and lane keeping assist work very well. If you're in the market for a reliable new car with state of the art technology this is one you should take a good look at. While i'm not big on extended warranties, especially not having any issues with my first RDX, they did sell me on a transferable 4 year extended ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty (9 years total). If nothing else it adds re-sell value. My only con is interior/exterior color selection. You're pretty much stuck with what they offer but not a deal breaker. Overall very happy.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Terry, 09/02/2015,Way better than expected!,pos,"We expected the RDX to be a great car but it has exceeded all our expectations.  The tech packages work fantastic.  The only issue is it offers so much tech that we keep learning new ways to operate the vehicle.  The car is very quiet, the ride is smooth and the mileage is very good for a new vehicle.  I would recommend the RDX to anyone looking for a smaller vehicle but needs lots of room for riders (I'm 6""2"" and my son is 6'5"" and sits comfortably in the front seats.)
"
acura,rdx,2016,Mike Wilson, 04/21/2016,Worst vehicle over $30K I've ever owned,neg,"While there were some high points with my 2016 RDX, all in all, it was the worst $30K+ vehicle I've ever owned.  First and foremost, the electronics in my vehicle were so buggy and unreliable, it became positively maddening.  About 1/3 of the time, my hands-free calls would fail to connect and leave the phone in ""private mode"" and utterly useless for 2-3 minutes.  Worse yet, the voice recognition was horrific.  The car dialed 9-1-1 three different times when I asked it to ""call Taco Deli.""  For all intents and purposes, the bluetooth phone operation was worthless.

The entertainment system worked okay, however, the preset labels rarely displayed the ACTUAL saved station.  When I pushed preset 1, the tuner would tune to 94.7, exactly as expected, but the label on the display was sometimes 138.9, sometimes all Cyrillic characters, sometimes all 1's and many other random values.  As long as I remembered what preset went with which stations, I was good to go.

The navigation system works, but the traffic indicators are illegible.  It actually took me a couple of weeks to realize I actually had traffic indicators on the Nav because the colors are so muted and the lines so fine.

Traction was abysmal in the rain and poor when it was dry.  While the RDX handles well (within traction limits), and ride quality was good, the traction was just such a liability.

Interior build quality was revealed itself to be sub-par over the second half of my year of ownership.  I had squeaking, creaking rear suspension, rattling door panels and a squealing A/C fan.

Under the hood, only one complaint.  I had a pulley that squealed as it spun down after engine shutdown.

On the plus side, Fuel economy was quite good and when I sold it last week, I got $35,000 for trade-in after only paying $39,500.  Headlights and general visibility from the vehicle were first rate.  That's about it for positives.

acura,rdx,2016,Gene, 04/23/2016,The RDX offers the best overall value for money.,pos,"It may not be the best vehicle in each and every category in its class, but when you weigh the pros and cons of the competition, it comes out on top. The factors that I look at in an SUV, are ride, performance, styling, interior room, resale and reliability. Sure, if money wasn't a factor, I would have chosen an Audi 6 cylinder Q5, or a BMW twin turbo X3. I just don't see $10,000 to $12,000 worth of difference. Keep in mind most of the competition comes standard with 4 cylinder engines. The RDX has surpassed my expectations in my early ownership, and I suffer no buyers remorse. My only issue is that I had to pay $468 to the service department for a ""spare tire kit"", as it comes with only an inflator and sealant pump. Other then that, all is well with my RDX.

acura,rdx,2016,Nancy Perry, 04/08/2016,Love it.,pos,"We traded in a 2004 Acura TL for our new 2016 Acura RDX.  My husband and I are Senior citizens and found that the RDX was easier to get in and out.  It has the Acurawatch feature which helps us drive our curvy back roads where we live.  All and all, its beautiful!  We have had it a year now and I am still in love with it.  This year I had a very serious spinal surgery and from the time I left the hospital I have had no problems getting in or out.  I am a short woman so this is very important to me.
"
acura,rdx,2016,James Jatczynski, 04/19/2016,Most car for the money,pos,"The RDX probably isn't the best vehicle in the small luxury SUV category in any particular attribute, but it does score near the top in most attributes, and it's that, combined with a price $10,000 or more lower than similarly equipped competition, that makes it a great buy as well as a very enjoyable vehicle.  We've found it very comfortable on a long road trip and around town.  We also feel that the understated styling will endure over time without looking odd or dated.

acura,rdx,2016,big ol' baby, 03/18/2017,1 year review,pos,"Assume the usual: great quality, good dealer, power, good fuel economy, useful interior, only thing I've done is change the oil in 1 year. The downsides: confusing owner's manual, slight blind spot on left front side, I've got wind noise at speed from I assume the outside mirror. After 1 year I still don't know how to do a lot of the controls even after reading the manual several times (and I have the base model). Not an exciting car but then I'm dull myself. It's a great, useful vehicle but not a sporty SUV.

acura,rdx,2016,Frank Runco, 10/09/2015,Nice,pos,"This is our 3rd RDX and I must say the 2011 was best the best handling and most fun to drive although kinda choppy. I liked that, wife didn't. We got the advanced package and the tech is way much and rather complicated for her. It's her car and she likes it. Got the advanced because of parking sensors front and back and nicer rims. Biggest complaint was the lack of color selection (did away with silver-now slate silver BLUE) ugh. Bought the white. Almost went to BMW because of that. Interior selection also limited, parchment only with white, no black.
 They still insist on a 16 gallon tank, way too small considering mileage has been about 21. Always stopping to feel up. Took a small 200 mile trip and still about 22.5. We've never had an issue with an Acura product and love our dealer. Have a 12 TSX and 14 TL SHAWD as well. Love them all. 
In retrospect tech would have been fine at 3000 less. And yes she would buy again.

UPDATE Have now had this vehicle 7 months and still not sure of the tech stuff and not liking most of it. Hard to see buttons and writing on them. Find myself searching all the time. Dual screen is foolish, makes no sense and is distracting while driving and hard to see in sun. Stupid that you cant operate phone book while driving. I guess designers think it's safer to pick up a phone and start searching. My 12 TSX and 14 TL both tech so much more user friendly. Find myself looking for those keys when heading out. Wife can have this thing, doesn't bother her because she ignores tech anyway.

acura,rdx,2016,WSD, 07/07/2016,First Acura - mixed feelings,pos,"the good stuff - overall a very nice ride. Good safety tech, stereo, looks and power. Stable at speed and good mid range power. Lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control are a great feature. Looks are very good. Stereo sounds very good. Seats are excellent, heated and cooled. dual zone climate control.  Several of the electronic features are very helpful.         The  not so great stuff - Transmission hunts a bit at low speeds on occasion, the nav system is a pain trying to use voice recognition to get a location. Still cant figure out how to just enter an address manually. Mileage is not as good as I had hoped but, mostly city driving so far so may improve.  It came down to this and a Lincoln MKC with 2.3 turbo. the Lincoln was faster and more luxurious but, went with the Acura for better resale value.
"
acura,rdx,2016,James Delaney, 06/29/2017,Junk the Navigation,pos,"If you absolutely rely on a navigation system to find your way around, buy another car or get an Iphone with bluetooth to feed reliable guidance.  The voice command feature offers choices that often don't relate to what you need and the thing usually doesn't accurately capture what you say.  The maps are sloppy and haven't kept up with other gps providers, so you routinely find yourself getting a signal that you are ""not on a digitized road"" when your iphone or Garmin shows that very road clearly. Lazy engineering here.  Also, there are destination commands that the system won't accept (try to enter Indianapolis International Airport on Co. H. Weir Road-mine won't take it).  Also, on a ""luxury"" car, one would think they would allow updates to the maps on a detachable thumb drive that could be plugged into a computer port instead of the clumsy, expensive updates-at-the-dealer system.  My urgent suggestion is that Acura (Honda) get in touch with the folks at Garmin who are developing an OEM navigation system for Daimler that doesn't have these faults and which may cost less now that development is about done.

acura,rdx,2016,6 month lease holder, 11/03/2016,6 month review,pos,"Very comfortable, more than adequate power, a pleasure to drive, especially on the open road. This suv could easily go all day smoothly and quietly at 80 mph. No maintenance issues so far.

acura,rdx,2016,Jenn S, 06/22/2018,After One Year...,neu,"Having given the base RDX a good year of use and driving 13k+ miles, I can report the following: THE GOOD (1) Ride is very comfortable, (2) road noise is low, (3) no issues with electronics or connecting my iPhone, (4) faux leather cleans up easily, (5) VERY fast and responsive acceleration, (6) nice, tight feel to the ride, (7) good sound system, (8) cabin is comfortable and solid feeling.  Now the NOT SO GOOD (1) HORRIBLE, I repeat, HORRIBLE gas mileage.  I get a combined 19 MPG, and probably only around 14 MPG around town - I was shocked at the numbers coming off owning a Honda CR-V.  For this reason alone, I will probably look at other brands for my next car. If you live in a flat area of the country and never use the AC, perhaps you'll get better mileage. (2) storage and cargo space is lacking and not very well thought out, (3) NO spare tire, and (4) jerky feel to the transmission when slowing/downshifting.

acura,rdx,2016,Margaret Neal, 04/19/2016,Not a cushy Buick,neu,"Great car to drive.  Adaptive Cruise, lane change warning and other safety features are just awesome.  Brakes are terrific.  Compared to our Lucerne, road noise is much worse, but tolerable; interior is not par w/price.  Ride is pretty good for suv.  Acura cheaps out on some features that will annoy you every time you drive it.  For the RDX, only one of the two key remotes w/the applicable pkg will start the car.  With the MDX, both remotes will do it.  Guess Acura saved a couple bucks to hack off customers.   Bad design is driver seat position.  Our Buick had it right..seat went all the way back when ignition turned off, making getting out really easy, after getting in, push driver 1 or 2 and seat, outside mirror, and interior mirror repositioned.  With the RDX, using the driver 1 or 2 setting, the seat positioned PRIOR to getting in.  For us short people, that made getting in difficult.  The inside mirror also was not among the setting.  We had to disable the seat positioning setting.  A really bad design.  Door panels are sorta cheap also.  Overall, a nice car, fun to drive but some cheap outs.  Not worth the price..but close.

acura,rdx,2016,Tom, 07/30/2015,2016 RDX Died in just 22 Days,neg,"Had my new RDX for 22 days and the instrument cluster blew out.  Was driving at night and the dash just went dark.  Got home but once I turned the car off it would not restart.   Just cranked.  No instrument lights, doors would not lock and the rear view camera display would not turn off.   Had vehicle towed to the dealer on July 15 and there it still sits as of July 29.   They replaced the cluster and that did not fix it.  Now they traced it to a wiring harness.   The dash of my new car has been disassembled and will never be the same nor will I ever be able to trust it.   I can already hear all the rattles.  I have owned Honda vehicles for 23 years and never had to have one towed.   Huge disappointment.

acura,rdx,2016,Jason, 04/05/2016,As Good as Advertised and Better in Some Ways,pos,"This is a really great car.  I got out of a BMW X5 for this one and the RDX is way better than my old bimmer.  The main thing I was looking for was a silky ride with a very quiet cabin.  I get both with this RDX.  The power train is exceptional with the standard v6.  The cabin is very quiet although some what less so than Edmunds reviews said.  Where Edmunds gave it an ""A"" - I would say it's probably a ""B"" or ""B+"".  It is quiet at low speeds but gets louder on highways.  As a plus, the ELS stereo on the Technology Package is an incredible system that makes the feint noise go away, replaced with beautiful music.  Navigation system is lame, use Google maps instead.  Edmunds says the screen controls for the tech is ""confusing"" but I disagree.  If this control panel confuses you, you probably shouldn't be buying something called a technology package. Love this car.  It's the best I've ever personally owned.

acura,rdx,2016,jrasero, 08/20/2015,35 more months to go!,pos,"Just leased a 2016 Acura RDX AWD Base.  Picked it up on July 31st and have put over 500 miles on it so far.  My purchase rational is comparing my parents Honda CRV EX-L Navigation versus a base RDX.  First and foremost the biggest difference between the CRV and RDX besides the Acura beak is the great 3.5 liter motor which has plenty of kick and power unlike the whiny CVT.  My father loves the great MPG on his CRV but hates the lack of power and secondly he hates the motor and wind noise.  The RDX has great pickup, the exhaust notes are smooth and crisp, and cabin noise is much better than a CRV and equal to my 2011 Lincoln MKZ.  The seats are comfy but the base comes with leatherette which is a little of a bummer, but the leatherette is still much better than the material used in an EX-L Honda.  The base is pretty bare bones and really to get the most bang for your buck the Acura Watch is the best option to choice.  Some standard features like blue ambient lighting,  turn signals, power lift gate, backup camera, keyless entry, push to start ignition, and sunroof are all notable.  The center stack and steering wheel still has way too many buttons. Visibility isn't great out of the back and getting Acura Watch w/ backup sensors would really help.  For a luxury car I would like to have seen backup sensors and blind spot warning standard.  Acura recommends premium fuel and on my first 2 tanks I have gotten 19 MPG average and 22 MPG average, hopefully after breaking in the motor and going for longer highway trips I will average 22-26 MPG.  Steering is good but numb and ride comfort is okay.  The RDX is firmer than I imagined and tends to bounce you around when going over bumps.  Value wise the RDX is hard to recommend over the CRV unless your like myself or my dad who finds the CRV to be noisy and slow and you don't prioritize MPG.  If the lack of power doesn't bother you a cheaper CRV is your bet.

Update:  June 2016 I actually sold the car after owning it for about 12 months.  Nothing wrong with the car but downgraded to an ILX due to space, mpg, and the car's eventual lease buyout.  I still stand by the fact that the RDX is the best value for a compact/midsize luxury crossover.  The tried and true 3.5 V6 has a ton of pickup and does 0-60 in about 6 seconds, while still getting 20/28 while smaller four cylinder turbo charged cars such as the Lexus NX get 22/28 mpg.  Moving to an ILX the biggest thing I noticed right away is space, since the RDX has plenty of it, whether your upfront, sitting in the back, or loading the trunk.  Also, the RDX is extremely composed and quiet compared to the ILX.  Uneven pavement, potholes, highway cruising the RDX is almost Lexus quiet.  The thing that I disliked about the RDX the most was that I got the base version so no real leather, no touch screen, no app integration, no safety features like  blind spot or adaptive cruise control, no ventilated front seats or heated rear seats.  Furthermore the RDX was just more car than I needed for grocery duties and weekend driving.  If I had kids, did more highway driving, or lived in a place with more snow or rain than the RDX would have been perfect.  Another great aspect of the RDX is the car's value.  I put maybe 7500 miles on it over 12 months and the car's value was almost $2000 above the lease buy out creating equity.  So if you are looking for a car that holds it value the RDX is great

36,000 miles in, have come to live with the idiosyncracies of the electronics.  The car is solid, gas milage is good...just under 30 on the highway.  Still a quiet vehicle. Found that we prefer the conflicting traffic signal in the rear view mirror to the other honda variant with a tv screen and rear view camera.  Lka is a light touch...not perfect but a good support system.  The auto braking system is helpful.  Best of all is the modern brakes...came to stop quickly on a night-black-ice road, true and straight.  Others behind me went off the road.  It is amazing (enginneeing marvel) to actually see how the 4 wheel drive system works when our car is dricen up an icy driveway.

The car is perfect for me, the right size, decent gas mileage, enough power.  Until about a month ago that is, it started having a strong jerk upshifting to second gear, it was intermittent.  After the third time of experiencing this, I took it to the dealership, who mentioned nothing about this being a known problem.  They said they couldn't replicate the problem, so I got to run around using Lyft for the day.  The problem happened 4 days later and I drove to the dealership, this time the problem replicated and the tech who was driving with me said this is a known problem.  Thanks for wasting my Saturday.  I hope they can fix it.

acura,rdx,2016,CBNEWYORK, 05/09/2019,SOLID PERFORMER,pos,"After extensive review of the Acura RDX, I recently purchased a CPO 2016 RDX AWD Advance package vehicle.It is everything and more so far on what I expected. The ride and comfort are on par with the Lexus RX350(which I had previously owned). I am getting better gas mileage and the overall safety features  are working as expected.Fit & finish is excellent. I have not been able to drive it yet in poor weather or snow, but I am confident on what I have read, it will perform well despite not having the SH-AWD feature.I will agree the navigation and voice controls are of lesser quality then a BMW or Audi, but the price of this vehicle for what you get in total far outweighs the issues compared to those other vehicles. Call this one a win! "
acura,rdx,2016,Richard Lee, 10/23/2015,"I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but...",pos,"I love this car very much, and I really want to give it a 5 stars review.  However, the breaking system seems not responsive enough, I have to press harder in order to make it stop.  Within a month, I heard noise while I hit break this morning, within a month!  The noise was gone when I drive it during my lunch break, maybe it's the temperature, but still, it shouldn't do that because it's a new car. 

Also, the engine is so called ""smart V6"", it switches from 3 cylinders to 6 cylinders depends on the situation, I can actually feel it.  The car vibrate a lot while it's on 3 cylinders mode, solid and smooth while it's on 6 cylinders.  Not very good. 

While the exterior is superb, it's way better than the previous RDX models, but the interior looked outdated compare with its competitors. 

The Bluetooth is convenient, but it kept disconnected and connected, can't stay connected.  Also, only the contact that's input to the speed dial (in car system, not phone speed dial) can display the caller ID when there is an incoming call.  There are only 15 space speed dial for RDX.  I missed many phone calls because I do not pick up number that I can't recognize, then I found those were actually people that I know but the car didn't display the caller ID because they are not in the car speed dial system. It's pretty dumb and outdated design. 

Finally, there is a backup camera, but no backup sensor... Doesn't make any sense.  The sensor should be standard if the camera is standard. 

Therefore, I like this car, but I can't give it a 5 stars because of the flaws mentioned above.

acura,rdx,2016,Joel, 04/05/2016,Bad car ruined by punishing suspension,neu,"Purchased the 2016 RDX advance which comes with nice tech features. Ride is comfortable on highway, punishing on bad pavement or potholes. Also what Acura claims are rain sensing wipers is false.they must be turned on and off manually each time it rains.as if left in Auto position, they continue to wipe even if dry.otherwise no complaints. Good car if you don't mind feeling every pebble on the road, but my last car was a Lexus so I may have been spoiled.
"
acura,rdx,2016,Nicole, 07/26/2015,Regret this purchase,neu,"I downsized from a GMC Yukon Denali for better gas mileage, and wanted a dependable newer car as my 04 was aging.  I am getting better than the 14/miles/gallon but not happy with car at all.  In the first month, already had AC go out during 90+ degree heat.  Was told it was low on freon.  A brand new car low on freon?   The navigation system is beyond frustrating and I end up using my smartphone or my TomTom.  The integrated voice command is not user friendly, despite spending many hours programing and watching videos on youtube as to how to ""learn"" the system.   As far as handeling, I know this is not a Denali or a BMW, but the handeling was very disappointing.  The first time I drove on wet roads I went through a very shallow puddle and I was nearly pulled off the road!  The interior is asthetically pleasing and comfortable, but I am very disappointed with the confusing set up of the bluetooth and voice commands as well as navigation.  I really would rather have my non-tech Denali back!   Car overall feels like a cheap SUV that has luxury interior.  The jewel headlights are GREAT and really light up the road at night.  LOVE those!

acura,rdx,2016,wayne21, 08/15/2015,Excellent car with lots of wind noise,pos,"Have had our 2016 RDX with Value package for about 500 miles.  We don't use the Bluetooth (don't talk on the phone while driving), but all the electronics seem great.  Phenomenal stereo system - easily the best we've ever had in a car.  The only real shortcoming is wind noise.  We test drove the vehicle twice and both times it was raining.  Now that we've driven the car for 500 miles I can truly say the wind noise is nothing short of ridiculous.  Yes, I know there is a three layer seal in the doors, but that doesn't stop the wind noise.  I don't know that we've never owned a car with wind noise this bad.  It's totally unacceptable for most cars, but for a car with a sticker price of roughly $43k it is shameful.  Cranking up the stereo is the only way to avoid hearing it all.

acura,rdx,2016,Dave P, 05/27/2016,Really nice vehicle,pos,"Outstanding options and value with our new 2016 RDX. We traded in an 08 RDX and it was such a great vehicle when we were in the market for a new one it was an easy choice. The new safety features, smooth ride, better gas mileage (even though it much bigger) and price compared to a BMW or Lexus was a no brainier decision. You will not be disappointed with this vehicle. Love it , thanks Acura for a great vehicle.

acura,rdx,2016,Alan, 01/02/2017,Great passing power,pos,"If you live in rural areas, RDX is your good choice. You can easy passing any car when you are going  up hills or passing the slow farm truck. But you still got good mpg. I drives mostly highway. I got 24mpg. On first 12000 mile.
Update 3 years of ownership, i have been moved from iowa to los angeles area. I have transmission problems and engine oil leaking issues  and the rear passenger seat bait problem but it was covered by Acura warranty services. I drive 50% highway and got 20 mpg only from 12000 to 30000 miles. I have been drove my RDX  from Iowa to Los Angeles, it was more then 1890 mile one way. I got 26 mpg. It was no problem on Rocky mountain. I have a 2016 toyota tundra with 5.7L engine. I drove the same route from iowa to los angeles. I have problem to go up hill without towing and heavy load. My cruise control have three time lost power when uphill. It was acceptable. 
Update my 4th years of ownership, My car just hit 57000 mile. I drive 90% in local street right now. I just got 19 mpg. I just have a brake sensor problem. I have been paid for $180 to fixed.  The car still good. The leather still look new without any special care. Only complaint is the oil change. All of the Honda and Acura have a sensor and service reminder to show you which service you need to do and how my percent duo. After i move to Los Angels. I needed to go to dealer almost every 4500 to 5000 mile from around 6 to 7000 in iowa with 90% of highway drive. So i need to go to dealer every 3 to 4 months. The micheline tire just down to 3/32 .

acura,rdx,2016,Glenn M., 06/25/2018,1016 RDX AWD: Almost Perfect,pos,"High Tech, High quality, Excellent Value.  I live on a steep hill and the AWD has worked well in heavy snow with factory all-season tires.  The car has remained solid and quiet after 3 years and 21,000 miles.  I find the GPS awkward to program.  Integration with my android phone has been spotty.  Cell phone messaging support has been on and off (currently on).  When I use google maps (GPS) on the Samsung phone, I need to turn off the cellphone bluetooth or play the GPS audio through the bluetooth input (without music).  I would prefer published maintenance intervals; the dealer sometimes suggested very short durations between maintenance events.  The service quality has been excellent, however.  Overall, I am very pleased with my choice to purchase the RDX.

acura,rdx,2016,SUV_bob, 09/24/2019,Great value as a used lux crossover,pos,"After reviewing on Edmunds and elsewhere I picked one up in 2019 to use as a high mileage sales car.  Now my wife and I use it more than the big Suburban sitting in the driveway.  Great get in and go SUV, great V6 power and rev sound, smooth tranny, nice handling and ride.  Comfortable for a big guy like me.  AWD is basic and really only works for getting up hills and starts in snow.  Easy to work on if you are into self maintenance.

Cons - wish it had wider tires (cosmetic thing), wish it had better infotainment system (very hard to use), wish it looked more upscale and less like a Honda CRV, wish it had higher towing capacity (probably can tow more that it is rated for).  

Issues - jerky shifting transmission - if this happens to you with your RDX it is a common issue and the dealer knows exactly what it is and how to fix it.  If the dealer acts like they don't know - they know.   

Other than that it is a super great value when purchasing as a used car."
acura,rdx,2016,Randy, 06/23/2016,Again......Acura gives you value for the money!!,pos,"Traded in a 2006 Acura TL that was really a great car and tremendous value. Would have kept but needed an all wheel drive vehicle due to moving north into snow areas. The RDX is a high quality ride and as always with Acura....reliable and great performance. The ride is smooth with tight handling. Mileage around town is 23-24 and on the road 31-33 depending on terrain.  Interior fits well with a normal size person and everything is within reach easily to see and operate. You won't be disappointed with this vehicle.

Update 12/23/18: Continue to be happy with the RDX now 3 years and 17,000 miles later. You won't be disappointed.
Update 12/26/19: Again, continue to be happy with the quality of the RDX, 24000 miles and 4 years in. Still very satisfied.
Update 12/27/20: 5 years in still very happy with the reliability and performance. Only 30,000 miles but the value is undeniable. No issues whatsoever.

Enjoy all of the technology features, smooth and comfortable drive, great fit and finish and the appealing interior and exterior design. We bought into the high Acura reliability and safety features."
acura,rdx,2016,Richard Fisher, 08/21/2015,Another disappointment,neg,"This is my second RDX.  I had a 2013 Base AWD drive model which was a very nice car but lacked the technology options.

Now I have an 2016 Advanced AWD and the technology looks promising but disappoints again.  The Nav system has only level of directions; no verbose or minimal.  The instructions do not override the radio .  I would like to have the radio go silent so I can hear the instructions. Yes I can turn the instructions off which is nice.

The speed limit is not shown (nicer would be if the speed would go red if I above it - either 1 mph or some amount I specify).  

The nice folks at Acura could not help me move my addresses from my Garmin to the Acura Nav system.

Wonder if Acura will ever truly think through the tech on their cars?

After 2 years.  While the car is a pleasant to drive, I find it taking in a number of ways. 
-  Adaptive cruise control is very abrupt, especially when someone moves into my lane. 
- The rear area is too small.  My wife has an outback and her back area is about a foot longer.
-  Fuel economy is the same (on paper) as the MDX though the MDX is significantly larger and weighs much more.

After two years with the car, I am trading it in for more space on an Outback.  Not as fancy, not as plush, but at least I will not feel cheated.  Acura failed to deliver on (1) fuel economy, (2) technology, and (3) interior space.  I  believe all this was done to protect the more pricy and profitable MDX line.  Here is a message for Acura - if you don't eat your own lunch, someone else will do so.  In protecting the MDX from the dumbed-down RDX you have made the RDX vulnerable to competitors.  And I have succumbed to a better car, IMO, at a much lower price.

After 2 years I decided to change to a Subaru Outback.  It has more space in the back and is a more honest car.  No dumbing down, WYSIWYG.

This car ia great! its very powerfull and acceleration is quick. There are plenty of room in a trunk. The only problem I have is that, I cannot get comfortable in the driver seat. I'm 6 feet tall ans struggling to find a proper ratio. If I move the seat too far back then my hands become stretched out, and If I pull it closer them my knees ""touch my ears""( seat at 105-120 degrees). This problem is not only mine because my friend is 6'1 and has exactly same problem. Before you lease or buy, make sure to test drive!! Also, I get about 11-12 mpg in NYC, and Im not even pushing it.

The luxury is gone, interior looks and feels smaller, doors even feel lighter.   The front of the vehicle has been redesigned and looks great, but everything else was too significantly flawed to hold my interest.

The RDX navi couldn't find half the places I wanted directions to and worse neither the navi nor a live Acuralink representative could give me correct directions to the nearest ER. I ended up at dead end streets. I brought the car in to be checked and Acura couldn't find any problems. What made me trade it in after only putting 2,000 miles on the SUV was the day I almost collided head on with oncoming traffic due to the fact that I was using Google maps to find a local business. After that, all I wanted to do was get rid of the near cause of a death or two. Will NEVER buy a Acura again!!

Con: The transmission is not as smooth and sometimes jitters found at low speed start, especially when the engine is cold.

Other thought: Wish the screen for backup camera could be 6"" or larger.

Update 7/9/18:

Pro: 
The engine is probably the best in the segment, although the max torque output could be at lower RPM.  More confident for the V6 than the turbo engines.  Very reliable, nothing needs to be fixed so far!

Cons: 
Tires screech easily at the start.  The Backup camera has poor visibility at dark.

4-5 year old entertainment system very similar to wife’s 2012 CRV. Leasing based on $38k sticker price. Smaller trunk space compared to 2012 CRV. 6 speed Transmission not as smooth as with base 2014 BMW 328 sedan. (Eight speed)

acura,rdx,2017,tabjaxx, 01/17/2017,First try with a luxury brand--2017 Acura RDX AWD,pos,"My wife wanted a small, luxury SUV and we settled on a 2017 Acura RDX AWD base model.  It is a solid SUV with nice features for a base model.  No squeaks or rattles.  Initial gas mileage was 25 mpg before the cold weather settled in, dropping it to a still respectable 23 mpg.  I like the variable cylinder management that shuts off 3 cylinders during low output conditions.  It is such a smooth process you don't know when it is happening.  The technology interfaces are kind of old fashioned for an upper end vehicle.  No touch screens or fancy graphics.  Buttons and knobs are nicely laid out, but I wish fan speed was controlled by a knob instead of buttons.  Radio does not stay on after car shuts off.  Seats are comfy, but leatherette surfaces are more like plastic than leather.  Heated seats warm up fast, but I miss a heated steering wheel.  Elevated rear seats are nice with plenty of legroom.  Great visibility out rear and side windows.  The 19.5 gallon gas tank could be larger.   The AWD version comes with a spare tire instead of a tire repair kit.  Headlights look and function great.   Overall, happy with the vehicle.  It doesn't necessarily have the feel of a luxury vehicle, but we don't feel we paid a luxury price for it either.

acura,rdx,2017,Happy, 07/18/2016,RDX > Competition,pos,"Three years/40K miles and still a winner.  Front right parking proximity sensor occasionally too sensitive but not a big deal.  

Updated:  Over a year in to it and still love the vehicle.  Utilizing the tech is still harder than it should be.

First Acura.  We (truthfully my wife) were looking for a medium size SUV to replace our 2001 Honda Odyssey.  We test drove the RDX, Lexus RX 350, Nissan Murano, and a loaded out Honda CRV.  RDX was our first choice by a mile.  Super smooth power train and very quiet/smooth ride.  Easily best value in its class.  Back seat room is exceptional for two adults but three would definitely be a crowd.  Only downsides include cludgy technology/interfaces, smallish gas tank, and somewhat narrow driver and front passenger seating.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Michael Marynowski, 07/08/2016,Very Nice vehicle,pos,"This is a vehicle that compares to competing brands that are much more expensive. I bought this RDX while trading in my larger MDX. The biggest difference is this is the little brother to the MDX and does not have the 3rd row of seats and thus less cargo space as well. I didn't need the space and welcomed the smaller SUV with better gas mileage! If I have any complaint at all it is that the front driver seats appears to be much smaller than the one that was in my 2012 MDX. It has been taking me awhile to get used to it. The bigger MDX seemed to have more support particularly with a bigger seat body that went up to the back of my knees. Other than that the car is fantastic. First time having cooling ventilating front seats which is a joy during the hot days. Definitely go with the Advance Package. All the goodies that go with it are worth the price!
"
acura,rdx,2017,Carlos Guzman, 02/24/2017,A sensible choice,pos,"I just got this recently, so I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I think that I have a pretty good idea of what this car is. Likes: the power and the price. Those were the two main factors that made me pull the trigger. They had a great lease deal and I really wanted a V6 instead of a turbo 4. Other cars I considered were the new Lexus RX350 (which was at least $150 more a month), the BMW X3 and the 3-series GT (probably $200 more a month, and their down payments are considerably more) and the Lexus NX 200t (smaller and turbo engine). The build quality is great. I got the base model with the leatherette seats and they feel very nice, other than the strong plastic smell. No sweet leather smell here. I like that this is lower than most SUVs, so it handles so much better and if feel almost like, dare I say, a sporty sedan. I had a Toyota Highlander before, and I wanted to avoid the dynamics of a heavy and soft SUV. . . It was a pregnant cow on wheels. The RDX's engine sounds sweet and pulls great -- the transmission, on the other hand, is slow and outdated. Forget using the paddle shifters, they are slow and there's a jerk when downshifting. Better just use your foot and/or sport mode and leave the paddles alone. This engine with modern 8-speed transmission would kill. Comfort is okay. Some people have complained about RDXs having suspension problems. The car doesn't like bumps. You can feel and hear the suspension working and I do think it's a design flaw, but not a defect per se. I did have suspension problem on a 2011 Honda Odyssey, and after multiple trips to the dealership and opening a case with corporate, they were never able to fix it. It's just like every other manufacturer, they have known problems with their car and they jerk you around until you give up. I personally like the simple entertainment system in this base model. Acura's technology package is outdated. I do wish the stereo was a bit better, but I can live with it. Bluetooth always pairs without fail with my iPhone 6. All in all, this is a great small SUV if you want acceleration, a bit of luxury, decent cargo space, and a low price. I think that naturally aspirated V6s are a dying breed, and by the time this lease is up, I'd probably be faced with choosing a 4-cyl turbo, or some type of hybrid system -- which I guess wouldn't be that bad. So far I'm getting 18 mpg (90% city traffic), and that combined with a smallish fuel tank has me going to the pump more frequently than I'd prefer.
"
acura,rdx,2017,drjcool1, 11/24/2016,The right decision on a 2017 Acura RDX Advance,pos,"I have been researching and shopping for a new vehicle for several months.  I had narrowed it down to the Acura RDX awd and Lexus NX and briefly thought about waiting until the new Honda CRV makes it's debut next month. Well, I just pulled the trigger on the RDX with all the bells and whistles, and I couldn't be happier.  It drives beautifully. It is quiet, responsive, and displays impressive handling.  Although the tech is probably of 2015 vintage (no apple car play or android auto), with ACC, LKAS, blind spot monitoring, collision mitigation, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, and stability control, I reallyb don't feel that I am sacrificing anything. I have no problem with the double screen setup, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, I enjoy having the big map always being displayed on the upper screen.  The ""cherry"" on top was a killer deal I secured after visiting/communicating with multiple Acura dealers in the NY area. I strongly suggest that you do your due diligence.

acura,rdx,2017,John, 06/09/2018,Great Daily Driver and Roadtrip Cuiser,pos,"I purchased a very low mileage (less than 1,000 miles!) CPO AWD RDX Advance, had it shipped from out of state due to wanting Fathom Blue Pearl and none were available locally and Advance trim was even more difficult to find.  Traded in an Infiniti G37x due to needing more space but not wanting to sacrifice too much performance and I love the RDX more than I thought I would.  Very comfortable as a daily commuter and navigating through rush or driving hours on end up to the cabin.  I thought I really wanted a BMW X3 or Audi Q5 but after looking at maintenance expenses and higher insurance costs ($20-30$ more/month for the German cars and RDX is same as my G37) plus long term Honda reliability and resale value, RDX was an easy choice.  I drove all three SUVs in heavy snow storms (I live in Minneapolis) before purchasing which I highly recommend doing and despite the less sophisticated AWD system in the RDX, it performed just as well on both slick roads and unplowed parking lots as the X3 and Q5.  For those who do not know, the AWD system in the RDX was updated for the 2016 refresh with a larger rear differential, thicker drive shaft, and larger rear axle drive shafts to handle a 60/40 front/rear power split as well as provide better dry road handling.  The 2013-15 RDX can only manage a 75/25 power split and in testing another family members '13 RDX, the updated AWD system handles foul weather significantly better and the rear differential does not overheat as it does in the earlier models.  The RDX rides much softer than the X3 and the V6 is incredibly smooth and quiet.  A recent 1,000 mile road trip yielded 30.5mpg round trip so no disappointment there.  I thought my Infiniti was quiet on the highway but wow is the RDX hushed when cruising at 75mph.  Other reviewers said this car was noisy inside but I highly disagree as do the professional auto publications.  In comparison, I was disappointed by how much road and wind noise the BMW let into the cabin at highway speeds.  The seats are extremely comfortable (I am 5'7""), ACC cruise control and lane keep assist work well, and the rear cross traffic alert is nice to have in busy parking lots.  ELS stereo has great sound quality and thump from the subwoofer and having both heated and cooled front seats is game changing.  I actually like the two screen setup and the NAV system will redirect you if there is a traffic incident.  I also like how it shows your next turn in the meter display along with the compass and other vehicle information.  My only gripe which I knew when buying this car is it a FWD platform with a transversely mounted motor and unequal length drive shafts so hard acceleration does bring just a slight, slight hint of torque steer but again, the updated AWD system does mitigate this compared to base FWD models and earlier production AWD RDX's.  Otherwise, I really enjoy this car for its looks, features, and all around handling/daily livability.

acura,rdx,2017,Mia, 12/30/2016,"LOVE IT, BUT...",pos,"Love my 2017 RDX , only has 1,200 miles, but I've had to bring it in to dealership for repairs already!   First incident:   Navigation screen kept freezing up and or did not work properly.  At one point, I was in Drive but the screen showed the rear view camera on.  Very unnerving!  I had to pull off the road on several occasions, turn off engine and then restart the car.   When I brought car to dealer, they claimed that they did not see the problem.  However, after I picked up the car, the problem seems to have disappeared.   Hmmm.....                                          Second  incident:   The brakes started squeaking.   Thought it would go away but, no.   Brought it back in and was told that something was defective in the installation.  They had to put in brand new brake pads.   Really???    A brand new car????    So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else will go wrong.   Love the comfort and safety of the car.   Fun driving!

acura,rdx,2017,Happy Driver, 10/21/2016,Happy Acura Driver,pos,"I was looking for a vehicle to replace my 2011 Lexus that had high mileage, and wanted a change.  The new Lexus is bigger than my previous Lexus and I did not want that large a vehicle.  I had test driven an Acura previously and went to the Acura dealer to check them out.  I love the design, I bought the RDX Advance, it is larger than the Acura I test drove 5 years ago, it is a great size for me.  It has a lot of bells and whistles' that is, technology features.  It is taking me a while to master them. But, I love the lane assist and blind spot warning, which takes no tech knowledge to operate.  I have only had the car 3 weeks, but so far, love it.  It drives so smoothly, with no noise.  The seats are very comfortable, great lumbar support.  I look forward to several years of great driving with this Acura RDX.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Norm in Amish Country, 10/28/2016,Nicely finished great drive with confusing Tech IF,pos,"Love the fit and finish throughout the exterior and interior of the RDX.    I like that I can plug in my iPod and control it completely from the audio interface.  The interface, however, is far from intuitive and I've often had to pull over in order to work through several attempts to complete an action (One example: search for and play a single song then revert back to shuffle and play the entire collection).  The front doors close with a nice solid ""thunk"".  The rear doors seem very light and uninsulated.   The gas tank could be larger -- it's 16 gallons which, with an average 23 mpg around town, gets me through about 380-400 miles before needing a refill.  Seems to come up way more quickly than my former car (a Buick Lacrosse that had a much larger tank and got slightly fewer mpg's).  I appreciate the ease of entry, the controls and comfort of the driver's seat, and the get-up-and-go when you hit the gas.  Love the car!
"
acura,rdx,2017,Chris P., 09/26/2017,A great car with a major flaw,neg,"So many things to like about this vehicle! Great cabin, smooth ride, sweet V6, impressive tech (except for the dual-screen radio/nav situation, just poor design)...until you get to around 5 to 7K miles and the brakes start screeching like you're driving with the emergency brake on. You don't expect a significant car component to fail that quickly, especially given Acura's reputation, for which I apparently gave them too much credit. A quick google search makes it clear this is a known issue. Very disappointing, Acura.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Dave Hagan, 09/26/2016,2017 Acura RDX Advance AWD,pos,"Updated 3/27/19:

Absolutely zero problems or warranty issues since purchasing almost 2 and 1/2 years ago. My wife loves to driving the RDX. Gets good mileage, around 24mpg on average. Technology could definitely use some improvement (voice recognition, slow interface). Could definitely use Google Maps / Apple Car Play. Extremely happy with the RDX still.


As the owner of a 2016 Acura MDX, my wife loved driving it but wanted something a little smaller. She drove a number of vehicles and came back to the Acura RDX. It was the best mix of comfort, luxury, sportiness, and safety of any vehicle she test drove. She is currently 3 weeks in to ownership and completely loves it. She was coming from an Infiniti G37, so was used to great acceleration. The RDX doesn't disappoint as it's one of the quickest vehicles in it's class. The only complaints would be average to below average navigation system and lack of power folding mirrors, panoramic sunroof, heated steering wheel, backseat climate controls, and Android Auto / Apple Car Play. The car excels in just about every other area. The Modern Steel Metallic with Graystone interior is gorgeous. Averaging 23 mpg around town.

3-26-18 Update: 18,000 miles later,My wife still loves the car as much as Day 1. Still zero issues with the RDX. Only complaint is really the outdated and slow navigation system.

acura,rdx,2017,Hunter, 08/04/2016,Love my new RDX!,pos,"Just bought my Fully loaded RDX and it's amazing!   Beautiful inside and out.  The tech is awesome and it practically drives itself.   Love the way it handles - very easy to drive - no blind spots thanks to the warnings and collision prevention and it's so easy to drive it almost handles more like a car than an SUV.   Highly recommend!  Love mine.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Robert Nordlie, 11/19/2016,Almost perfect RDX,pos,"I've had my RDX for a month and already have 2000 miles on it.  Overall, I love the car.  Very comfortable seats and ride, however, I've had a little difficulty finding and ideal driving position.  I am very tall and with the seat all the way back to accommodate my legs, the steering wheel does not telescope quite far enough to be completely comfortable.  Many complain about the two screen technology but I like it very much.  I also own a Corvette so I like to go fast, and as a result I'm only averaging about 21 mpg around town, but that's fine with me since I had a Ford Explorer Sport before this and only got 17 mpg with that.  Overall, I am very satisfied and would highly recommend this vehicle.  I really like the styling, with the door handles contoured to the belt line and the LED headlights.   I also like the clean back end with no bumper sticking out below the hatch and not visible exhaust tips (and yes I do like the four exhaust trumpets on my Vette).
"
acura,rdx,2017,Scott, 12/27/2016,So far so good.,pos,"UPDATE 12/27/17 - after owning this car for 13 months and 12k miles, nothing has changed. Basic maintenance and same comfort and performance. My only minor complaint is the passenger window occasionally goes down about a half inch on its own. I notice because it rattles. I don't know why it dies this- almost like road bumps rattle it loose. I switch between regular and premium gas and notice no difference in mpg. Car feels like it runs better on premium but not enough to justify the 70 cents + per gallon difference. 

Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.

acura,rdx,2017,Bunni, 01/12/2017,Gorgeous but Tech Not!!,pos,"This RDX is gorgeous and unassuming!  (I'm still getting used to it as I've owned it for less than 30 day.) I treated myself with the top of the line all the bells and whistles!!  I love it!!  The only issues I see is with the Navigation system and headlights.   I traded a 2015 Jeep Cherokee and expected Acura's Navigation system to be superior, however to my surprise my Cherokee's was far more superior and so intuitive.  I didn't need to read the manual or look up any info regarding it.  Also although Acura advertised the best headlights I can't see a difference from my 2015 Cherokee.  As I said I do LOVE this SUV, the ride is very comfortable and I love the AWD and all the safety features.  I think this is a great value and I plan to keep this SUV forever!!"
acura,rdx,2017,Miguel, 04/08/2019,Get into an RDX if you value your money,pos,"This base model is just that base. No extra pampering or extra gizmos but that’s what we wanted. However, being an Acura this SUV does deliver a great product for what you spend. Love that this RDX came with standard things like power lift gate, sunroof, etc. that most other manufacturers charge. We love the practical setup of the instruments. Granted it’s seems a lil archaic in this day of touchscreens and such but it’s simple and safer for eyes on the road. iPhone 8 works ok for pandora and music. Every now and then it will require a reattaching of the usb cable to clear up an error. Bluetooth works well for calls and audio. But a problem persists with loading my phone book which is annoying. Text option isn’t compatible another downer. But all in all it’s a decent base system. Oh and also the subwoofer if you call it that is a joke. Barely audible lows. The comfort is great Plenty of space for 5. Flat rear floor which is great. Leatherette feels ok just cross fingers it lasts. Enter and exit very easy, doors open just wide enough. Cargo space is typical. Love the power lift gate especially when you got your hands full. Powertrain is awesome. Has great power when needed. The 6 banger of yesteryear is an oldie but a goodie. Turbo 4’s are the rave with minimal mpg gains. Our engine seems like it’s bulletproof and will last. I typically get 28-29 highway and 25-26 mpg mixed driving. Plus it’s premium recommended not required, another plus. The old 6 speed shifts smoothly and paddle shifters don’t add any excitement just a “neat” feature. Love the headlights. I travel primarily dark 2 lane highways and owe it to the LED lights for saving a few furry road obstacles and damage. It has a significant cutoff that doesn’t bother until I get into hilly roads. Road noise isn’t an issue. Pretty good but don’t expect a vault silent ride. The ride is well composed and might I say a lil fun when on twisty roads. Handles well for an SUV. As far as issues or problems that take us to the shop? None. This may be the last of the stalwart Acura’s for the time being. Mechanically it’s stout. Just simple and cheap maintenance. All power options thumbs up. No rattles, leaks, or things coming apart. The paint/finish looks good but compared to my wife’s  one year older Lexus, well let’s just say it’s not as glossy and rich in color. We want to keep this for a long time and are confident it will last for that. Honda needs to get back on the saddle as far as reliable vehicles in their Acura division. I sure hope so because eventually we will need another RDX in the distant future.

acura,rdx,2017,Dhan Persaud, 12/28/2016,Drive of rdx,pos,"Car is great overall the only thing I didn't like were the lights in cargo area and trunk space could be a little bigger but besides that car is fun to drive and also changing the gas from 91 to either 93 or 89 octane because I don't see 91 everywhere I go car has great features and very comfortable to drive through and weather good car over all and I do love the way it drives

acura,rdx,2017,Gary, 02/21/2017,Blows my former Lexus NXt200 Away,pos,"I owned a Lexus NXt200 for the last two years and have been a Lexus guy for 20 years. Still love their cars. However, I have been driving the  the RDX for the last two months and can definitively say it is far and away a better car than the NXt for my money. In short: the RDX interior feels more luxurious; acceleration is much smoother; car is quieter; and the technology such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure and blind spot monitoring make long trips much less stressful. You almost feel like you are a pilot monitoring a plane on auto pilot versus constantly turning cruise control on and off and fighting your way through traffic. It's more like you glide your way through traffic on the interstate. Of course, no car is perfect and there is still room for tweaks and improvements. For example, if you are on the interstate in the left lane and going around a long curve the car senses the the car ahead of you in the right lane is actually in front of you and slows down unnecessarily. But this is a rare and minor annoyance, especially compared the the raft of positive attributes this car possesses. I highly recommend you check it out during your due diligence period when shopping for a mid-size SUV. I am extremely happy I did.
"
acura,rdx,2017,Happy RDX owner!, 08/14/2017,So glad we bought this car,pos,"Update #3:  Our RDX now has over 80,000 miles on it (as of Sept 2020).  If someone tells you that a highly reliable, very enjoyable car with great safety can't be made in the U.S., they would be incorrect.  Not a single repair.  This car was built in the U.S.  Given our ever changing world, I am just so glad to support a good management team along with the U.S.-based people that built and maintain this car.  I am hopeful Acura will follow a similar path as Porsche, and return the RDX to six-cylinder power.  This car has plenty, plenty of torque and horsepower.  Although it continues to get in excess of 30mpg on the highway, it would be great for a new RDX to get better mileage than this one or also the current, new RDX.  As a bit of a sidenote, the original equipment Michelin tires lasted more than 60,000 miles.  Since most of my time now in the car is highway commuting and I prefer to listen to the radio, I am even more glad for the high quality stereo.

Update #2:  Our RDX now has over 51,000 miles on it (as of Sept 2019), and we remain completely satisfied with this car.  

We have used two Acura dealers for servicing, which has worked extremely well and been a pleasant surprise.  I started taking it to the dealer for maintenance only to ensure the Certified Preowned Warranty was complied with - I'm now comfortable with the two local Acura dealers, unlike almost all other car dealers.  

At this point, I'm glad we had the tires rotated several times in the past.  Best I can tell the OEM Michelin tires will still go another few thousand miles before needing replacement.  Acura has done a great job with the design, construction, and ongoing support of this vehicle.  

Update:  We are now 10 months into our ownership of this car.  Since then, two other family members have bought or leased new Acura SUVs based on our favorable experience.  We use the car quite a bit.  It will probably have around 23,000 miles by the end of our first yr of ownership.  We bought it certified pre-owned with about 3,000 miles already on it.  I still very strongly believe we bought the best and right car for us and our needs.  Haven't had any repair needs.  I regret having the tires & wheels rotated - the car now has a very, very slight pull to it, which didn't exist before the tire rotation.  With the car being 4WD, I should have been much less concerned about tire rotation.  Overall, though, this is just a great car.  Encourage you to read my further notes below, as I don't have any revisions to my earlier comments.  Thank you Acura!

We are about six months into our ownership of a '17 Acura RDX AWD with the Technology package.  We also strongly considered a Volvo V70 Cross Country, RAV4 Hybrid, and a Chevrolet Impala.  V70 doesn't have near the rear seat leg room that the RDX has, which was important for us since we have taller teenagers.  Impala would have been a solid choice for us as well.  Also strongly considered a RAV4Hybrid; not sure you can tow anything behind it due to the hybrid drivetrain?  Definitely like the controls in the RDX - seem notably better than even those in the new MDX.  Upgraded stereo with HD radio was well worth it.  Very thankful for the generous cargo capacity behind the rear seats.  We had a hitch installed at the dealer.  Although the towing capacity is not high, it certainly expanded the usefulness of the vehicle.  This thing is truly a Sport Utility Vehicle in the best sense of the category.  The drivetrain is just awesome.  To get somewhere around 30 mpg on the highway with that amount of power available (and safety) is amazing.  Transmission shifts extremely smoothly.  If I could choose one upgrade for this car in the future, it would be for either an ""eco mode"" that shifts the transmission sooner, thus saving on gas, or an extra gear in the transmission for less consumption on the highway.  One other suggestion:
  a buzzer should automatically sound immediately if the car is put into gear with the parking brake set.  There have been two instances where I put the car in reverse and started to back out of a parking space with the parking brake on.  I only got a few feet before the warning was sounded, but makes no sense why this warning wouldn't take place sooner.  Another important point:  this car is made in the USA!

acura,rdx,2017,Be Pivirotto, 10/31/2016,RDX - Outstanding value with Class,pos,"Really enjoy the RDX and compared to my brothers Lexus, it blows it out of the water.  Instrumentation is the only negative as it is very confusing and not easy to intuitively understand the functions.  The split screens are also confusing and should be combined into one screen and not the dual screen method as of now.  Ride, handling, safefy features such as lane departure and lane departure assist are outstanding!  So glad I decided on the RDX.

acura,rdx,2017,Broka, 05/02/2017,2nd better than the 1st,pos,"This is my 2nd RDX and my 4th Acura. My 2015 RDX came off lease and I turned in for a 2017 AWD Advance and it is awesome. I loved my 2015 but this one is even better. The LED lights are unreal and they fixed all the problems I did not like with the 2015 (no vents in rear, passenger seat that goes up and down, ...) Little stuff but they add up. This one even has ventilated seats (Cool)!!! But I do notice a difference in the ride. It feels heavier, more solid, more powerful, smoother. Once set up, the touch screen is great. I spent a long time looking and checking out ALL of the competition from Mercedes, BMW, Cadillac, Jaguar, Range Rover, Jeep, Subaru, ... Perhaps it is not the sportiest but it is just as fast without the noise as any of the others with their turbo 4's and it holds the road beautifully. And its roomy too!! Definitely the right choice.

acura,rdx,2017,Tom, 07/08/2017,""" Catch a '17 before there gone""",pos,"I did extensive research on smaller/midsize SUV's. I concluded the Audi Q5 and BMW 3 were not much better, seemed smaller, although specs don't back that up, and simply not worth the added cost. It came down to the Ford Edge Titanium with301 package with V6 in white and RDX with Advance Package. Liked the extra cargo space of the Edge and thought it was a very quiet comfortable ride. The bottom line negatives were poor Ford resale value versus the RDX, the lower gas mileage with the V6, the Sony sound system and ""slightly"" less interior quality. When Acura announced 2017 clearance prices last month, I was able to get one for the same price as the loaded Edge. I have driven now for 3 weeks and I am very satisfied with my decision. The infotainment system is a little hard to get used to but I am finding that the overall technology used in the Acura is really quite amazing. The engine does not hesitate like the Edge V6 also. Get the great price on 17's right now!

Gas mileage is less than window sticker at average 18 mpg but acceptable for V6 that is smooth and peppy.  Time to get a replacement - wont be another Honda just due to voice/nav system.

The only downside so far has been the factory installed car alarm.   When loud cars pass by the alarm keeps going off.   I took it to the dealer to try to get the settings adjusted but when they said I had to leave the car there for the day just to adjust it, I just left.   It's gone off at least a hundred times so it is a bit if a nuisance.

Acura fixed the issues with the car after many tries but I was not happy with the customer service I received from. The local dealership was not a problem,  it was Acura customer service. 
I traded it and will never buy another Acura. 

I bought a 2017 RDX was very happy at first.  Stylish comfortable SUV. Then at 30,000 miles the car suddenly started jerking when accelerating from a stop.  Been in the shop st Acura 3 times.  Told it was fixed but now started doing it again.  An added bonus is now my check transmission light,  lane change error light,  flashing D light,  and emissions light all came on.  At this point I feel that the class I expected at this price point and Acura name was misguided at best.  I had better luck with cheaper model cars. So as of right now I am scared to drive my  newer vehicle very far. And yet again have to take it back to the dealership.

The V6 is very smooth and has some get up and go.  I love all the safety features in the advanced package.  I really like the navigation and being able to send destinations from your phone to your car navigation and calling Acura link to find a destination while driving.  The only thing lacking is there is no remote start option on the app and no heated steering wheel.

acura,rdx,2017,Rich, 09/04/2017,Nav system and Acura watch are totally worthless.,neu,"Nav system is terrible. Multiple steps to perform the simplest function. Voice recognition is so poor it's almost amusing to see what they come up with. Phone system is almost as bad. I've given up and use my own phone for navigation if I want no problems. Acura should refund the cost.               Front seats are short and hard like sitting on bleachers.  Ergonomics are joke.

acura,rdx,2017,TiggerEsqOC, 05/19/2017,So far - Great,pos,"So far this car is what I expected.  It is a good value which is the main reason I chose it.  I wanted a small SUV but not too small, with good MPG and some creature comforts.  My base with Acura Watch Plus does not have navigation, which I did want but it also doesn't have some of the custom ability that I would like and am used to.  Such as unlocking all doors when unlocking one, the passenger seat only has 4-way adjustment.  The acceleration is good, and it has the power I need.  I was driving a $60k Audi Q5 as a loaner before I got the Acura RDX, and that was an amazing car, but I didn't have $60k to spend on a car, for the price difference (I paid $34,000) it is a great option.
*Update - my review above is still accurate.  I now carpool with three teens, the car is comfortable for them. 
*Update 11/22/18 - Car is really perfect for what I need.  I wouldn't call it fancy, there are much more ""tech"" available on other cars but what it has is fine.  The only complaint which would be an easy change is to be able to program the all doors to unlock when I unlock one.  The Pleather seats hold up well to a German Shepherd and a Corgi mutt.

acura,rdx,2017,Nice G, 12/30/2017,Never again!,neg,"Purchased 17' CPO RDX Tech AWD with 9900 miles on it from paragon acura. (CPO is a joke!) Few days later noticed a tapping noise coming from the engine compartment. Took it to one of the local dealers. I had to leave my CPO(!!!) car there for 14 days for Torque Converter replacement. Done. The tapping noise is gone. Great. ... Now I got a few new problems: 1. Upshifting hesitation  @ 20 mph.  2. Rough downshifting @ 20 mph. 3. Feel a jerk just before it comes to a complete stop. Will take it back to them next week. As soon as I got out from the dealer decided to check on their work...oh my... Drivers side mirror scratched, plastic engine cover under the hood was not secured- just left loose on the engine, 4 plastic clips are missing on under-the-hood panels. So much for 2017 acura CPO junk... Never again.

acura,rdx,2017,Denise, 04/18/2017,Great luxury SUV for the money,pos,"I love this car. It has the space and height of an SUV, but drives like a car. The standard features are better than all of the competitors. Acura service is also top notch. They go out of their way to help and accommodate you when you bring the car in for maintenence.

acura,rdx,2017,Albert Zack, 01/05/2017,Not a lot of bells and whistles for a luxury brand,neu,"Even though we got the base RDX model, I was really surprised that to see the CRV from Honda (Acura's sister company) had some features the RDX did not.  From my perspective, the base RDX should have more features than the highest-end CRV considering the Acura higher end positioning.  Overall, we like the car, but just disappointed on how Acura cut corners.

The transmission shift is clunky.  I expected much better gas mileage but the around town is a Killer.  Looks good, easy to get around in and park.  When you get out of either side, your foot hits the threshold and it gets dirty and stained really fast.  Mine is a light color and looks nasty already

acura,rdx,2017,Kleo77, 02/27/2017,Not flashy but drives great!,pos,"It's been a long road till I pulled a triggered and leased 2017 base model AWD RDX. I also looked at BMW x1 & x3 and infinity Qx30 & QX50. Acura was a winner due to the best deal and dealership experience. I traded in my 2011 3 series that I loved but the CPO warranty was about to expire and I refuse to pay for fixing cars so in order to prevent it I decided to get a new car. I wanted awd because we go often to the mountains. I did not want the technology package because I hate having too many buttons and features even though I'm very computer savvy. I just assume that simple solutions are always the best. My fiancee got x3, retail price 10k more- it was a demo so its fully loaded but my car drives almost as nice as his and mine gets better gas milage even though his is 4 cylinder turbo. I got 22 freeway and 20 combined which is exactly the same as my beemer and better than my 2011 AWD Nissan Rogue! I consider that very good and I hope it will stay at this level (BTW unlike most people I do manual gas milage calculation every time I go to the gas station and don't rely on the computer readings because they are hardly ever accurate- beemer was most accurate). My other car option was x1 since I've always liked but it would cost me still more than Acura and it is a much more smaller car. RDX is equivalent of x3 and is a perfect size for me. Base model had keyless entry, moonroof , heated seat and back up camera which is all nice to have. The drive quality is very good, X3 has a better suspension but is also a stiffer ride due to run flat tires and bigger rims. I was very dissapointed with how much my 3 series depreciate during my 3 years of ownership that I'm not longer their loyal customer. They also stopped offering free brakes in the first 4 years of ownership which was another bummer. ON top of everything I think their cars are kind of outdated looking so its time for major overhaul. I might consider the x3 in 3 years if they come up with the nice design. Not that my Acura is a hot looking car because its super bland but the deal i got justifies it. The lease on Acura and Infinity was much cheaper for a very simple reason - Japanese cars don't depreciate as much as German cars. Anyway RDX is great car and the only downside is there will be  anew model coming up soon thats why I opted to lease. Highly recommended, safe and efficient vehicle.

acura,rdx,2017,BobM, 10/23/2017,Missing the Mark Electronics,pos,"I have owned 8 Acuras over the past years always pleased with overall quality reliability and cost of ownership. However, my pet peeve is the interiors, they are skimping on the quality,  i.e using the imitation leather vinyl whatever it is it's tacky cheap. The Worst is the so-called carpet is the thinnest low pile, like the cheapest you can buy at a home deport for covering steps ugh!     The voice-activated Navigation and voice recognition for the phone is the absolute worst in the industry.     I frequently rent cars Ford GMC and Toyota all are superior. I speak clearly precisely and it doesn't recognize me or my spouse's  or others commands or comments. Yes, it's frustrating.  This joke of voice recognition is like speaking to a deaf-mute, it is horrible not even worth having it  The overall experience is now negative. The one other major issue is the phony chrome ring around the AC vent outlet next to the doors reflect directly into the outside mirrors how stupid is this  Honestly it's a major distraction on a critical safety device.    Time to wake up Acura and step up your game to keep me,   I'm going to Lexas 
Update dealer changed out the vent to solid black. Mirror problem is fixed thank you. 
The Navigation stil the worst
I don’t even use it I use my iPhone

Why
Because all you say is directions and the address and it finds it and takes you there without any hassle using the Acura navigation system is like talking to a dummy it only understand specific commands it does not understand or can adapt to different voices .
Much much worse is someone sitting in the passenger seat can’t even punch in the commands because it won’t let you do it while you’re moving so you have to stop your car and spend 15 minutes programming all the information manually . That’s  not convenient that’s absolute absurdity
Wake up Acura

acura,rdx,2017,Lulu, 07/20/2020,My Dream Car!!!!!,pos,"So I have been looking into cars for a while and I found the Acura RDX. My family wanted me to get an suv because they feel they are safer than sedans. I thought this was a good car since its not too big. I was also looking at the Nissan Rogue, toyota rav 4 and honda crv. The style of the other cars just was not as appealing in my opinion. So I narrowed it down to the 2017 Acura RDX in white with black interior. I watched so many car videos and reviews on this car and all I can say is that I am so happy I got this car. Since COVID19 is going on I was not able to go into the dealership and had to rely solely on videos I saw and trust what the reviews and test drivers said about the car. So I kind of took a big gamble choosing this car but everything worked out! It is perfect. I ordered it from Carvana and it was delievered to my house. I drove it for the first time today and woww!!! It so sporty and light, so easy to drive I love it. I am so used to driving my mom's car which is a mazda cx9 so it is a lot bigger and heavier. However, this car is so much fun to drive and its perfect. I am also nineteen so I think this was the perfect small suv for me. An affordable luxury car. I would 100 percent recommend this car to anyone looking for a new car!

Gas mileage is not as bad as I thought it would be, some options I would like to have is adjusting the lift gate (hit the garage door when in the garage) my other SUV you could adjust.  Size is great, more roomy than I thought it would be and I am very happy with the safety features.

I agree with Edmunds review that it is quick to brake when there is plenty of space that does not require the over reaction.  Love the dual screen and while there is a learning curve on the navigation,  my phone app has a better navigation then what Acura provides.  Still.  It's not a deal breaker and I look forward to when I get to drive my car- which is a first for me.  Definitely a smooth, quiet ride.  And very comfortable on all fronts.  Just love it.

acura,rdx,2017,Nor Cal Driver, 05/27/2019,Decent car with some odd issues,neu,"Bought with 10k miles after reading lots of reviews. Engine is powerful, but transmission isn’t very fun, sport mode pretty much unusable. Weird rattle from steering wheel that I just found out has a service bulletin on it from Acura so will need to get that fixed. Safety features sound good but adaptive cruise control over reacts and is pretty annoying. The blind spot works great though as does the emergency braking. Makes a squeaking noise when driving at slower speeds in front brake area.  
Pulls slightly to the right when driving, might just be alignment issue. For the price I was expecting less issues. Super comfortable seats and great acceleration. Good amount of space inside when you need it. Kind of hard to park in tight places like parking garages as it’s kind of wide, and turning radius isn’t great. 
Performed ok in the snow, not amazing or as good as my Subaru did. 

Overall I would not recommend this car. I definitely regret buying it. It’s just not very fun to drive. Neither sporty or that utilitarian. For some people I think it would be a good vehicle for some, just not for me.

Dealer had to replace a wiring harness to fix the problem. Got the car back and now the Radio does not work properly. It sounds ok for a while and then the music sounds tinny like the bass was turned off. the satellite link for radio is terrible. Navigation is difficult to use and often send us out of the way. The voice commands is sketchy at best. Locking the doors on the car is tricky - if you press it twice too close together, the windows and roof open! The Hands Free isn't very adaptive. My 5'10"" husband has a great deal of difficulty getting in and out of the car... it is very tight. If you start the car top gear out and walk around to the other side, you can't open the other doors or tailgate. You have to walk around top the driver side and unlock from there.  PROS: the back seat covers are fitted perfectly.

acura,rdx,2017,Richard Meltz, 04/23/2017,Design Defect- Do not Buy,neg,"We leased a fully loaded Acura RDX and are very disappointed. There is a clear design defect that Acura dealers deny even knowing about. When driving the side view mirrors show a glare from  the air conditioning vents. This is because the vents contain a silver metal design and the sun shows the glare on the side view window. It is more than annoying and is a distraction. When we called the dealers, they claim not to know about it. We even spent money to tint windows, but this failed to help. In calling around to other dealers, we contacted one out of state who acknowledged it was an issue. This dealer said they were changing the vents by inserting a black rim in place of the silver one. Thus, you can now enjoy a far lower priced Honda instead of an Acura!!!  Calls to Acura customer service have not been returned as promised. Also, my wife's foot cramps when driving because the pedals are too high. Others have complained about it according to another dealer I spoke with. The Navigation is cumbersome, difficult and voice recognition is terrible. It is hit and miss unless you always want the date. Any other info? forget it. I do not recommend this vehicle to anyone and am surprised that Acura hides these issues. I will try to get out of my lease because of these issues.

acura,rdx,2017,William Hall, 09/02/2016,New Acura RDX,pos,"Just finished driving this car on two long trips. First trip was a 2000 mile Florida trip in the spring. The second trip was a 2 month, 9000 mile trip to western National Parks. The RDX performed great on both trips. I was impressed at the comfort of both the driver and passenger seats for long Interstate driving.  Gas mileage was very good on the open highway at 27+ MPG. The vehicle was loaded as full as we could get it and it handled the load very well. The RDX also performed well on mountain roads at altitudes up to 10000 feet elevation. Overall I am very satisfied with the RDX, but do wish it had a little more luggage space(guess I needed an MDX).
Two additional years and 20000 additional miles and vehicle still performed well. Changed tires at 35000 miles and only have performed normal maintenance. Recently had vehicle on 1800 mile trip and vehicle performed very well, mileage was over 27 mpg in mostly interstate driving. Only negative concern is that suspension starting to show some harshness to absorbing road bumps. Other than that performance is similar to new with no identified  problems.

Regardless of the product from rototillers to jet airplanes, whatever they make works and works well.  Yes, all cars break, some more than others, but for 40 years starting with Honda and then  Acura.  My last four Acuras never glitched once, same for my Hondas.  Moreover, you can judge a car company by how they handle recalls.  My last recall from Honda went perfect and was professionally fixed w/o a hassle.  For safety, reliability and style, I'll continue with Honda/Acura as long as their engineering and build remains excellent.  Lastly, resale is another consideration for owning a Honda product and to top it off, my RDX was made in the US.  That alone should be reason enough without even considering the lower cost to insure.

The ride is very smooth, and the seating is comfortable in front and rear. Very fun to drive. V6 has plenty of pep. No blind spots. Technology and controls still take a little to get used to - NAV control is not intuitive (yet) and voice commands are a work in progress. One USB port? Seriously? Ventilated seats are a nice touch but can be a little loud. Overall these gripes are very minor in nature, and we're very satisfied with the RDX. Would recommend to a friend.

acura,rdx,2017,Just Chuck , 10/22/2020,Great except for harsh ride,pos,"Just picked up a CPO '17 RDX six weeks ago. I've taken it on to two trips into the city, about eighty miles roundtrip each, one trip to another city: that was about 300 highway miles roundtrip, and driven it about 500 miles around crowded suburbs running errands. I've put about 1000 miles on it in six weeks. Happy overall, but the ride is harsh. Even with tire pressure at just 30 PSI, every bump is felt. Cross shopped the Lexus NX, have a Lexus RX also, and was turned off by the NX's tight, narrow cockpit. The Acura feels significantly higher up and wider inside than the NX. Power is great, tech is mostly good. I don't use any vehicle's navigation system, but I did try this one around an unfamiliar city with some people who knew where we were going, and they told me it was bad. Took us on a longer route than necessary. Other than that, seats are good, sound system is good, steering feels numb but handling is very good. A little nitpicking- I like that on my RX the mirrors fold in when the car is locked, the RDX does not have that. I did get the top of the line Advance Package, and that was another selling point here- ventilated seats, collision mitigation, top of the line sound system, lane departure warning- which is annoying as it picks up the back wheel near the line on curves. I turned off that Lane Departure. It also has Lane Keeping Assist, which is supposed to gently move the wheel to follow the lines in the road. I can't say that I feel it doing much of anything. Adaptive cruise control is a nice feature, if you have traffic light enough to really use it for a long time. Headlights are very good. Seats are good, but not up to Lexus RX standards. Overall, I   hoped I was getting a another Lexus RX but on a 4/5ths scale. This is not that. It's good, competent, and overall a fine choice, but it's not buttery smooth like the RX, or as comfortable. My only tip to you would be to look for one with the Advance Package, and get all the bells and whistles. My vehicle with under 25,000 miles on it was $28,000 plus tax and tags, the same price as the lower trim line models that were a year newer and had similar miles. Obviously the year matters little when buying used and planning to keep a long time. It's well worth it to look for the Advance Package for the ventilated seats, adaptive cruise control, and upgraded sound system alone. So, I'd buy it again, but again, look for the Advance Package, which is hard to find. It seems only about one out of every 20 or 30 cars are loaded up this way.

I had been driving on run flat tires for so long I had forgotten how bad they are. The RDX is simply more comfortable over all road conditions. Test drove the 2018 X-3 and was disappointed in the BMW’s turbo 4 pot. Even though it had good acceleration it’s still displays an economy car feel, sound and characteristics. Visibility is super, comfort is excellent. Just finished a 650 mile road trip that I had taken many times in the X-3 and felt more comfortable and much less fatigued in the RDX. Throw in at least $10,000 lower price than a similarly  equipped X-3 and I’m simply a happy camper.

acura,rdx,2018,Bill Kramer, 08/21/2018,2018 RDX TECH PACKAGE,pos,"We bought the car for my wife’s daily driving and long trips. We compared the 2018 RDX with the tech package to a 2019 RDX with tech package, CRV, RAV4, and an Audi. While the 2018 doesn’t have all of the bells and whistles, i.e. Apple play. It had more than enough. The 6 cylinder normally aspirated engine with the 6 speed tranny are more than adequate. It’s quick and handles great. We especially like the the split screens. We have NAV and music choices going on separate screens and don’t find them distracting at all. Oh and did I mention it was about 10,000 + dollars cheaper than the Audi, BMW, or the 2019 RDX. All in all great value and great fun to drive.

acura,rdx,2018,jrasero, 03/01/2018,Awesome SUV that is a bit long in the tooth,pos,"While the RDX 2nd gen has been around since 2013 the car has aged well and received a nice mid cycle refresh in 2016.  The car is basically unchanged for 2018 and with the 3rd gen 2019 RDX on its way this summer you probably can score a good deal on a current gen or get one if you refuse to adopt to a high speed transmission w/ a turbo engine.  One of the best parts of the 2nd gen RDX is the bullet proof 6 speed transmission paired to the 3.5L V6 engine, that has 279 hp and 252 lb-ft of toque, which means a healthy amount of instant power to the wheels.  The car emits a healthy growl and is equipped with VCM so even with a V6 the RDX's 19/27 MPG is very respectable since a Lexus NX 200t AWD w/ a 4 cylinder turbo gets 22/28 MPG.  Even though most luxury compact crossovers are oriented for utility and comfort it's sad that Acura omitted SH-AWD from the 2nd gen.  The basic AWD system is fine and probably more than enough in most situations, but Acura's SH-AWD system is almost equal to Audi's Quattro system and it could have helped in acceleration since the RDX does suffer from some wheel squeal.  I mostly cross shopped the RDX against the Lexus NX 200t AWD and while the Lexus just is more luxurious and offers more high end features it can costs thousands more than a RDX, it lacks the cargo/utility of an Acura, and noise wise it is louder, which is odd to say about a Lexus.  The top of the line Advance trim offers some nice features as nice rims, heated & ventilated seats, remote engine start, rain-sensing windshield wipers, fog lights, and front and rear parking sensors but still lacks Android/Apple compatibility, heated steering wheel, heated outboard seats, panoramic moon roof, high grain leather, thigh extenders, wireless charging, 360 cameras, plus the RDX lacks some of the materials associated with a luxury car.  If these aforementioned features aren't required than I think the RDX sits in between something like a loaded Honda CR-V and a Buick Envision, Infiniti QX50, Volvo XC60.  RDX's resale and reliability are top notch and compared to German cars Acura maintenance is considered normal to even cheap.  Acura recommends premium fuel but regular does just fine.  The trim I wouldn't recommend at minimum to get is the Tech package since it provides sports seats w/ perforated leather, 8 way front passenger seat, on demand multi use display, voice recognition for Nav and Climate, navigation, AcuraLink, Real Time Traffic, ELS audio system, Siri Eyes Free, Blind Spot Info, Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.  Overall the 2018 RDX is a very good car and really its biggest issue is that feature wise it falls behind the pack, but if you don't need the latest and greatest and want something that has a luxury caché and has a V6 engine with a smooth a quiet ride there aren't really many choices besides the RDX.

acura,rdx,2018,Tim Peters, 07/11/2018,Great ride and versatile vehicle!,pos,"I was driving a 2015 Acura TLX sedan. We moved to a new home that lies on a ridge at the top of a steep drive. After the first snow I realized we needed an AWD vehicle. I did not want to give up the precision, technology or the fun factor of my TLX but I knew that I needed something that had AWD and sat higher off the ground while still offering the precision, technology and the fun factor of my TLX. The RDX provides all of these qualities. The transmission is very smooth (more so than my TLX) and the 279 HP V6 is responsive and quick. The ride is quiet and comfortable, yet has responsive handling and steering. It has a sport mode with paddle shifters like my former TLX. The AWD system sends 50% of the torque to the rear wheels when needed. More than enough to navigate a snow covered steep drive. The voice controlled audio, navigation and climate control are top notch and the Siri hands free option works great. Cargo room is great for a five passenger SUV as is the fit and finish. Lane keep assistance and auto sensing speed cruise control make longer trips less tiring. Highly recommend this vehicle.

acura,rdx,2018,Jim from St.Paul, 08/03/2018,Great Ride - revisited,neu,"We’re coming up now on 10,000 miles, and the more I drive this SUV, the more I like it.  It does the little things well... it knows your seat memory settings by your key fob.  You step into the car and it adjusts automatically.  We have the Advance package, and we’re really enjoying the ventilated seats, rain sensing wipers, and the ELS sound system.  Cargo space for hauling is as roomy as my Subaru Outback, and the all wheel drive is just as good in snow and primitive trail conditions.

If you are a big “need connectivity to my phone” kind of person, this isn’t the car for you.  Bluetooth works well but the screens look dated - like an older version of Windows.  That said, it is understated luxury - it’s not a sexy BMW nameplate, but we didn’t care about that.  If you want creature comforts that come with a premium brand combined with excellent reliability, this is your car.

acura,rdx,2018,E.K., 01/20/2018,Great buy,pos,"I 've only had my SUV a month and I love it. It handles well in the freezing rain. Everything about it is great except for acceleration from starting point. Also it uses 91 octane or higher which is more costly. I find I have to go to gas up more often although I don't let it go below 1/4 of a tank. I drive a lot and don't want to run out in the middle of nowhere. Overall I think this is a good automobile and am enjoying it a whole lot. I would  buy another.
"
acura,rdx,2018,JKF, 07/23/2018,Satisfied Customer,pos,"Based on a month of having this car, very satisfied with it so far. Pluses, in my opinion, include strong and smooth V6, 6 speed automatic transmission, smooth and comfortable ride, and it gets gas mileage in line with the sticker ratings. Also, I like the volume and tuning knobs for the radio. Have a 2016 Honda CR-V, as well, and it does not have the radio control knobs, just some buttons to try to find while driving. The Honda does have a right side camera in the mirror, but the Acura does not...kind of surprising. Good deals available now on the 2018 since a restyled  2019 is out on the lots.

acura,rdx,2018,Tony Lee, 09/02/2018,Best vehicle ever own,pos,"I just traded in my 2014 CRV for a 2018 RDX Basic AWD. I love this car because it had the same simple controls as my CRV.  I beat myself for not buying this sooner.  I didn't like the 2018 CRV because of the Turbo & SVT, I couldn't careless about MPG. nor premium fuel.  I test drove but didn't like the following on the 2019 RDX : Turbo, SVT, nice looking console and interior, but complicated entertainment controls. I do wish I have SH-AWD on the 2018 (Another one of those MPG related item from Honda Corporate philosphy). My 2018 RDX has plenty of power, comfortable seats and firm ride, best headlights, excellent brake, air conditioning, .good AWD in snow.  I drive my RDX with confidence and not worry about a steep hill. The only thing I didn't like were the useless pedal shifter and the small gas tank.
I owned this car for over 2 years. It is still the best car I ever owned with no problem whatsoever. It was always a pleasure to take it to a long trip. I would add that the normal maintenance of this car is not that cheap."
acura,rdx,2018,N1128Q, 10/17/2017,Good Vehicle But Not a Luxury Ride,neg,"The 2018 RDX is good but basically a Honda with some nice touches and a different grill. I've leased Audi vehicles for several years but decided to go with the Acura because the 2018 Audi Q5's lease quote was about $100/month higher for a similarly equipped vehicle. After driving the RDX for a couple of months, I can see why. The difference in interior materials, engineering, and overall luxury show that the Audi is far better. In particular, I'm disappointed in the assembly quality. Exterior panels have uneven gaps, bolts and screws are visible, and there are other areas that show that Honda took assembly and materials shortcuts which a ""luxury"" brand should not do. In addition, the dealership experience left a lot to be desired as the RDX was not prepped correctly, tires were over-inflated, the front license plate bracket was not attached, and (not to sound petty but this goes to the ""experience"" factor) I did not receive a full tank of gas. When I said something to the salesman, he brushed it off. Since then, I have not heard from the dealer or from Acura - even to see if I'm enjoying the vehicle. Overall, I'll keep the RDX but think I'll go back to Audi for my next vehicle.

This is an update of the review I posted in October. Since then, my RDX developed squeaks, rattles, and buzzing that demonstrated the indifferent quality of assembly and the poor choice of materials. The voice recognition system got even worse and trying to work with it in traffic almost resulted in accidents on two occasions. While the navigation system could ultimately find the desired destination, it never chose the best or even safest route. The seats became more uncomfortable over time, to such an extent that my wife had to use a seat cushion to even sit in the vehicle for a drive longer than 30 minutes. Finally, at 7800 miles on the odometer I gave up, ""bit the financial bullet"", and got out of my lease. Acura may aspire to premium status but I know I'll never get another one. The materials, assembly, fit and finish, and technology are, at best, equal to Honda but at Lexus prices. My wife's Hyundai Elantra is a better vehicle than the Acura RDX.

acura,rdx,2018,domer, 05/24/2020,"This is a very, very good vehicle",pos,"I honestly don’t understand the critics of this vehicle.  It is quick and reasonably efficient - especially on the open road - nimble around town, spacious, reliable and a great value core the price.

Mine has 23,000 miles on it, and the only thing I might changed is to go with the AWD version.  The power easily overcomes the front wheel adhesion on quick starts, but with a little throttle modulation that is easily quelled,

I’ve owned a couple of BMW X3s, Two Audi Q5s (including a TDI, which is in a class by itself) and an Acura MDX.  The Acura RDX is a good as any of them, except possibly for the TDI.  I’m glad I bought it.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Pat Houge, 08/10/2017,VISABILITY,neu,"I just purchased the 2018 RDX Advance Package. This package comes with exterior side mirrors with a film on them which really distorts the driver's vision. It is especially bad on the driver's side where the mirror is divided to see far & near objects which is not necessary.  This film only appears on the Advance Package vehicles.  Due to the distraction & very poor visibility caused by these mirrors, Acura should issue a ""recall"" on these vehicles. On the 2018 vehicles this flaw was corrected.  Additionally, the interior appointment of this vehicle could be improved with a nicer dash, steering wheel, floor mats, etc. Also, the driver's seat will not push back far enough for my legs to feel comfortable & the driver’s seat is not comfortable. Consequently, I had to buy a seat cushion.  Additionally, the ride is far too rigid & stiff taking bumps in the road too harshly. This car rides more like a sports car rather than a fully loaded SUV. I would never recommend this SUV.
"
acura,rdx,2018,Greg, 10/29/2017,Had high hopes,neu,"With the glowing Edmunds review I thought this was the one.  Then we took it on a test drive.  The road noise was so bad that while on the highway you could not hear the person siting next to you with a normal speaking voice.  And, you had to almost scream to hear or be heard from the back seat.  Yes, the technology is great and with it being a Honda, the reliability would probably be excellent as well, but the interior noise just kills the deal.  Also, the rear seats are rather hard and not very comfortable.

acura,rdx,2018,Craig, 06/21/2019,RDX reliability is poor Engine mis-fire problems,neg,"Be aware that my RDX is a 2018 and is having random check engine lights which means an engine mis-fire.  my RDX has only 7,000 miles on it and is having a serious issue.  the Engine mis-fire issue is pouring raw fuel (un-spent) into the exhaust system which could lead to a fire.    The immediate action was to stop driving the vehicle.  So now we have a new RDX that has been in the Acura dealer shop for nearly 5 days with no indication of whats causing this problem.  If we do get the car back i am now afraid to drive it due to this issue.  So be aware of the reliability issues we are experiencing with our Acura 2018 RDX.  This might be a one off but wanted to let others that may be thinking about an Acura RDX know of the problems we are having with a car kept in a garage, maintained and treated with white gloves on.

acura,rdx,2018,Rtn, 07/28/2018,Nickel and dime you,neg,"Poorly designed vehicle, a true Frankencar. GPS sucks, Infocenter sucks, interior design sucks, A/C sucks.  On the exterior, every place possible will catch pine needles and debris to encourage rust.  Engine & chassis great, everything around these two aspects suck. Dealer installed roof rack was a waste of money.  The roof rack is some weird metallic silver, which does not match anything else color wise on the car.  Plus the roof rack cross bars are installed at angle so it looks like someone made a mistake (honest). The all wheel drive capabilities are truly limited unless you change to mud and snow tires for the winter, when it snowed here in Seattle I could not get out of the driveway.  The GPS is truly a boat anchor, as example if you enter Lowes Hardware it will provide you a choice to make between 846 Lowes stores.  Same is true for anything you enter, and you cannot tell which of the 846 to choose from because they all start with Lowes Hardware and no city information is readable, it is a real POS.  If you are brave to try the voice commands on the infocenter you will more than likely get the response there time is:

acura,rdx,2019,Petros Bezirganyan, 01/07/2019,Close to Being Perfect Compact Luxury SUV--Not The,pos,"After months of researching and shopping, pulled the trigger on new  RDX w/ Tech... After driving it for 3k mi in 2 months, here are my impressions.

THE GOOD

1. The leather seats are very soft and comfortable. Beats any latest model Nissan, Volvo or BMW. The real leather is exquisite.
Acura makes the best leather seats, period. Better than the latest Volvo XC90 or XC60, BMW X3 or 3 series, Nissans and even Hondas and Audi Q5... The only seat that is better is the one in Volkswagen Passat, but these are synthetic leatherette... The seat is 16-way power adjustable, and on Advance trim it has power thigh extension as well...
Love the seats...

2. The ELS 3D Studio premium audio system is sublime. The surround sound is fantastic, and is second only to Volvo's latest Bowers & Wilkins audio system.

3. The style. I really, really love the body styling if the new RDX. It is elegant, agresive, sporty, modern. I really love the 19"" shark gray wheels. The cabin is modern, luxurious and I would say, elegant. Love panorama sunroof.

4. Comfort and ride. Very quiet cabin, supple ride. Good rear legroom and headroom

5. Cargo capacity. Is on par with any compact SUV, and is better than almost all luxury compact SUVs.

6. Price point. Very competitive guven the amount of features.

7. Engine power and torque. With 272 hp on tap and low-RPM 280 lb-ft of torque, this SUV has a    pick-up of a sporty sedan or a hatchback.

8. Handling. With its wide stance and low profile, coupled with torque-vectoring all-wheel drive, this SUV corners flat, and can handle any curve confidently, feeling sure-footed on any type of pavement.

THE BAD

1. Transmission. Acura keeps telling us (since the crappy 6-speed in 2013 RDX and 8, and then 9-speed ZF transmission in Acura MDX 2013-2015, 2016-2019) that they are going to finally fix the rough and jerky gear shifts, especially at low speeds and going uphill, and finally they claimed that they did it with the Honda-engineered 10-speed transmission, debuted in the 2018 Honda Odyssey, and now in 2019 RDX...

But let me tell you, this tranny, although much better than 9-speed German-made ZF and the 6-speed in old RDX, still has some serious issues: at low speeds it tends to keep in the middle gears (3-6), instead of downshifting to 2, perhaps--I don't know, but the effect is as if it is in higher gear at lower speeds than it should be, preventing acceleration at speeds at around 25-30 mph, or when coasting to a stop light or parking... This is very annoying, since the vehicle feels underpowered for simple maneuvers, like coasting to a stop light or driving in a parking lot. Pushing the throttle, simply jerks the vehicle forward, as if accelerating from dead stop, which is not what one wants, and is dangerous in traffic or parking garages... Disappointing.

2. Fuel economy on premium 92 grade gas. In the mixed mostly city driving I average only 21 mpg on premium gas. Very disappointing. On regular 87 octane gas, the fuel economy drops to 20 mpg. Disappointing...

3. Small fuel tank, short driving range on a full tank. With only 17 gallon tank, maximum I can drive on premium gas on a full tank is 300 miles, before the fuel gauge light up. Very, very disappointing... My Nissan Rogue would go 359 miles before I had to stop for refueling...

4. Infotainment system. Very, very glitchy and underbaked. Using the precision touch mouse pad is awkward; using navigation is clunky. Voice recognition barely works. The loading of contacts takes a very, very long time... Calls are driooed every now and then; the system hangs intermittently... Nissan's simple Bosch-designed infotainment puts Acura to shame... Android auto is not supported as of yet... No way to look up point of interest phones; no Pandora or Google integration. My Nissan had all that. I miss Nissan's infotainment system...

THE UGLY

1. The brake pads already
 squeal on all 4 as if completely worn out on a brand-new vehicle with less than 3k miles!!!

2. Passenger wiper is not retracting completely. This is a calibration issue, which Acura is looking into.

3. The hatch back-door creaks and moans on opening and closing, just like a whale.

4. Driver vanity mirror cover squeaks when opening. Not nice.

5. The cargo area liftable cover does not stay open, and needs to be held while accessing the underfloor storage compartment.

6. To put in roof-rails and crossbars, Acura is asking for $1,200. Very expensive for almost a necessity on a SUV.

CONCLUSION

On hindsight, unless you are getting a super killer deal on 2019 RDX (e.g. below invoice), I do NOT recommend buying or leasing it, until Acura addresses transmission and fuel economy issues.

Also, note that it is a wide vehicle: 4-5 in wider than a regular sedan or a compact SUV. This may pose a challenge when parking in tight spaces.

acura,rdx,2019,Eva, 11/08/2018,I Traded-In My RDX After 7 Months Of Ownership,neg,"I had my “dream car” for 7 months and then traded it in for something more reliable. When I first purchased the Acura RDX Advance I was ecstatic. Everything seemed to be customized for me. From the memory seats to the technology, to the safety components. I was in love with my SUV. However, things seemed to go south the longer I owned the vehicle. First it was the constant issues with the Infotainment System. I would exit the vehicle and it wouldn’t turn off. I called the dealership and they either thought I was dumb and didn’t know how to operate a car, or they would say “this is the first time we’re hearing about this...” I found a site called AcuraZine which had a workaround for turning off the frozen system so I wouldn’t get a dead battery. So that was the first issue. The second was the constant brake squealing after about 3 or 4 months of ownership. I drive typically on the interstate, so nothing weird about my driving habits. The last, and most terrifying issue was the electronic issue. I was on my way to work, driving about 65 mph, and everything shut off except for the engine. So I had no dials (since they’re digital) / no GPS / no A/C nothing electronic whatsoever in my car. It was pitch black. I was in the middle lane and there was no way to pull over. I safely made it to work. When I placed the vehicle in park all electronics came back on but they were “strobing.” I called the dealership who told me to bring it in ASAP. After an hour they found nothing wrong and sent me on my merry way. This happened too many times for me to be comfortable with the reliability of the vehicle and the dealership never found any issues so I just traded it in for something more reliable and safe. I really wanted to love this car but for the price I paid (and the thousands of dollars I lost trading it in) it just wasn’t worth my safety. I hope this helps others.

acura,rdx,2019,Marianne Stolfi, 08/19/2018,Navigation system never worked.,pos,"From the first time I tried to use the navigation system it would not recognize the input address. I tried every method. ( It was the address for the Bethpage DMV!). I called my sales person and he walked me through the steps, it still did not recognize the address. I drove the car to the dealership. Another sales person tried to tell me that the problem was because Bethpage and Oyster Bay had the same zip code. (They don’t!). I tried to use the navigation to get to a friends house, it took me to a shopping center. I tried to use it to get to my home address. It tried to take me twenty blocks away. When I got fed up and called the service manager, he admitted that they were having problems with the new system and he didn’t know when it would be fixed. It is now over a month since I got the car!

acura,rdx,2019,Mark S of LI NY, 01/16/2019,Infotainment System Huge Disappointment,neu,"Own the 2019 RDX Advance since 8/13 . Before this I owned a 2014 RDX & before that 2010 TSX. I enjoy the handling, look (in & outside) & feel of the new RDX over the 2014 (2nd generation) Several over the air updates During my first year & 1/2 did had not corrected the quirks, concerns & non-function features of this new RDX talked about in a couple of forums. It was not until the most recent update did Acura solve nearly all the navigation problems.  The fee based ($110 year) AcruaLink app is quirky as well. They keep taking features away with disregard to its customers. Such as downloading directions when car is off & viewing tire PSI. By the way, subscribing to app is only way to remote start unless you pay nearly $500-&600 to dealer to install transponder. Crazy Acura did not incorporate it do need would be to just but a remote start key-bobb  

All means I Likely would not buy another Acura product in the future as Honda/ Acura should not have rolled out the new system before they had in working properly. I’m disappointed with them for not debugging the software before rolling it out to the consumer. Failing to do that, they had a OTA update in Feb. 2019 that messed up come features that had been working. I feel as if I’m part of a beta test. Its software is more than buggy.  

Even as the majority of infotainment system issues were corrected on most recent update it took them over 18-20 months after I bought it to address them. Though less of a concern they did not fix the issues pertaining to “Restaurants"" or ""Food"" or Shopping or Gifts as well as Travel Agency”; ALL of which are blank showing no data at all!!

acura,rdx,2019,Lynn, 11/05/2018,Trouble From Day One. Now a Lemon,neg,"I drove off the lot mid June only to notice 4 flaws before I got three blocks:  front windshield crazed between layers, visible only when sun directly on it,  Steering wheel unraveling, flaws in clearcoat on hood and faulty rear hatch.   After 4 weeks and a loaner for 13 days car seemed fixed and great—-until suddenly I had nothing on computer screen.  It’s now working again but frequent messages of LOADING which takes several minutes or FUNCTION NOT NOT AVAILABLE with steering wheel controls.  Often I drive miles with no access to screen as it spins.    Local dealer and corporate say an update is coming but nobody knows when.  I’ve waited 3 months now.   So now nearly 5 months in I have no horn.  Keeps blowing fuses and nobody knows why.  Car been in shop several days.  I’m afraid to drive too far from home for fear screen will go out again or I’ll have no horn. Other  problems include cracked battery cable, a mysterious mug rolling around under seat which was not mine.    Seat had to be removed to get it.  Leather on most seats is picked and I’m told it’s normal.  But no car in showroom is puckered like that.   I’ve been Honda and Acura owner 20 years.  Still have a perfect 2012 TSX.  But I’m done.  Poor quality and poor attitude from corporate in trying to get problems resolved.
UPDATE
It’s taken 4 months since filing Lemon Law Arbitration paperwork but my 2019 RDX is an official lemon and I’m awaiting buyback check.  The issues have been many since the day I left the dealership. I’ve posted before. But the horn that simply kept blowing fuses every time used and the constant malfunctioning Infotainment  issues put me at 84 days out of service and 26 trips to the dealer in 6 months. 
I’ve been shopping and sadly nothing duplicates the great look and handling and amenities for the price.  But I can’t go back. Not only do I fear another faulty vehicle but Acura treated this 20 year Honda and Acura owner terribly. At the hearing everything was my fault. I must use the horn too long or too often.  I do not but even if I did, so What!,   I must not see the obstacle when the collision mitigation engages on an empty road. The screen blinks because I must be using main headlights in the daytime. Seriously!!?? The 62 days out of service for the horn should not count because I could’ve driven the car with no horn.  Duh. That’s illegal. The cruise doesn’t work because I used it in the rain.  No. I showed videos of the malfunction on a sunny day. 
I still have to drive the car while awaiting settlement and no dealer will see me to reset my flashing screen. This helps for the short term.  Shame on Acura for the delays and treating me like an ignorant owner. My past 4 Honda and Acura vehicles never once saw a dealership but for maintenance.  I could list dozens of family members, neighbors, colleagues and friends who have made choices other than Honda products recently. Strangers stop me to see if I love the RDX. I tell them the truth. Had Acura come through with the buyback they said they were evaluating after 31 days out of service (legal definition of Lemon in FL), this would have ended better for all of us.  Hoping the money/car exchange happens soon so I can move on and take the road trips I had planned nearly a year ago.
The buyback finally took place in June - nearly a year after purchase.  Shame on Honda America for the stalling and the insults and the rude treatment at the final arbitration.  As a Honda/Acura owner for over 20 years I could not take an exchange.  Took the money and now I’m wonderfully happy in my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  The computer is dependable and much more efficient than what Acura tried unsuccessfully to do in their 2019 RDX.

acura,rdx,2019,JrBrowzer, 04/06/2019,Two Years and Going Strong!,pos,"I've had my RDX for almost two years now and it is still a dream SUV. Initially, there were problems with the Apple Play technology, but they have been resolved. It still drives like new!
"
acura,rdx,2019,Krewman, 06/25/2018,"Great vehicle, but not perfect",pos,"Have put 1,000 miles on my new fully-loaded RDX. Love the ride, handling, and acceleration. Interior materials and seat comfort are excellent. Premium sound system is awesome (Last night, I sat in the car, ignition off, and blasted 70's rock and roll for an hour).  Love the heads-up display and ACC. There are, however, a few things that drive me nuts: 1) The nav system has a major flaw - you can't easily zoom the map in/out while guidance is in use. Sounds trivial. It's not. 2) Synching a phone does not provide access to the phone's contact list.  In fact the entire bluetooth/phone system is frustrating to use and poorly designed. Thank god for Apple CarPlay so you can just avoid the Acura system all together. 3) No place to put spare change except in the center console. Yes, it's a nit, but would it have killed them to add a small nook to keep coins?  4) The touch pad will make you insane the first few days. Then you get the hang of it and it's not too bad.  Still, Acura definitely needs to improve input approach.

**UPDATE**
I've driven the vehicle for over 13,000 miles. 

The Good: 
1) Acura updated the software so you can now zoom in/out when using the navigation system.
2) No mechanical issues. Trouble free.  Nice!

The Bad:
1) The nav system is still a mess. At times the turn arrow on the heads up display doesn't match the turn arrow on the dash display. For example, the heads up will have a arrow pointing to the left, while the display has an arrow pointing to the right. Bring a penny with you so you can flip a coin.  Second, using the voice command feature to enter in a destination is an exercise in frustration. You often get a ""destination not found"" or it misinterprets what you said and sets the destination to somewhere random. We actually play a game to see who can get the navigation system to set the most ridiculous destination. However, you can avoid the Acura nav system entirely by using Apple Carplay. Which brings me to item 2.

2) Apple CarPlay works. Then it doesn't. Then it does. Then it doesn't. It connects. Then disconnects. Then connects. Then disconnects. I have Apple Carplay on my other vehicles and it works fine with my iPhone, so the problem is with Acura. The workaround is to connect your iPhone to the vehicle using Bluetooth and then use Google Maps or Waze for navigation. You'll be limited to the iPhone screen, but at least the voice directions will play over the vehicle's  sound system (which, by the way, is awesome).

July 2020 update. 
If you have the heads up display there’s a fun game to play. Enter a destination into the navigation system. Then watch as the heads up display and the dashboard screen display completely DIFFERENT turn directions. So entertaining. 

As stated earlier, the electronics package on the vehicle (e.g., navigation, phone, radio, etc) is poorly designed and even after several updates is frustrating to use. 

To avoid these problems, just use Apple CarPlay. Oh wait, never mind, CarPlay only works intermittently. Like, hardly ever. 

Mechanically the vehicle is top notch. After 28,000 miles no repairs needed and no problems requiring dealer visits. Comfort and ride remain excellent.

acura,rdx,2019,Scott, 04/27/2019,Great Vehicle with One Serious Issue,neu,"Overall I enjoy the RDX but be aware there is an issue when under hard acceleration the engine may stall/lose power.  It’s happened to me twice in the 8 months I’ve owned it - both times on an interstate highway.  I was fortunate both times to make it to the shoulder without incident. Neither Acura nor the dealership admit to an issue but it’s serious enough that I won’t buy another until it’s resolved.   CarPlay still isn’t perfect as it randomly disconnects within the first few minutes of use but works well when it does stay connected.  It is annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Unhappy Acura Buyer, 03/18/2019,"Buyer's Remorse - Squeaks, Rattles, Glitchy!",neg,"Good Points - Awesome front seat comfort, stellar acceleration and handling.    Bad Points - Interior is quiet, EXCEPT for ALL interior squeaks and rattles that mostly cannot be located or stopped (I've resorted to stuffing folded business cards in seams where noise may be coming from, rear hatch rattles incessantly).  Transmission shifting at low speeds is unpredictable and RPMs stay at 3000-4000 before up-shifting killing city MPG, Apple Carplay crashes incessantly,  app for remote start works about 70% of time keeps asking me to re-register.  Accelerator lag is noticeable off the line every time (Acura - please  test-drive a Honda as they do not have lag issues).  Awful gas mileage - City MPG is 17, Interstate MPG is 24 on the best day.  My 2017 Honda CRV gets 24 MPG city and 31 MPG on the Interstate and no 93 octane required!  My 2018 V6 Honda Odyssey gets better MPG and transmission (reportedly same Honda sourced 10 gears) shifts much more smoothly and predictably.  Acura Dealer in Elmhurst Illinois is unable or unwilling to address interior squeaks and rattles......   Looking to trade-in this MISTAKE and to go back to a Mazda CX-5 which I had previously - better value, more interior road noise but no accelerator lag, smooth transmission, no squeaks and rattles.

acura,rdx,2019,Don't buy an RDX, 03/31/2019,So disappointed with my first Acura,neg,"This car is haunted!  The software needs so much improvement, and the dealership says they can't do a thing.  The radio comes on at will and often will not allow me to change channels.  Sometimes I can make phone calls, sometimes not.  The car has refused to go out of Park twice, so you can't go anywhere.  It has locked me out and has stopped in traffic twice.  All infotainment features work when they want to.  Sometimes I have no contact list and sometimes the car tells me it cannot perform the request, like make a phone call.  It is driving me crazy; I am always waiting for the next shoe to drop.  I have had it about 6 months and plan to trade it after a year.  It is a pretty car but does not perform reliably at all.  Even the mileage is not as predicted.  Every day it is something..................save your money and buy a decent car!

acura,rdx,2019,Scott Diedrich, 11/15/2018,I wish we could give our RDX back,neg,"After a month of ownership, with two weeks in the shop during this month, we are finally getting a new transmission for our RDX. Sadly they should be replacing the car considering the transmission started acting up with 30 miles on it, but instead have wasted weeks of our time and act like they are doing us a favor by replacing it. It would slam in to gear, feeling like it was skipping multiple gears at a time. Sometimes it would just hang up between gears, other times it would just rev up and not go before finally shifting in to gear. My favorite solution from the dealership was to just let the car warm up and auto start it and it won't be as bad. Granted, the issue was worse when the car was cold, but it also did it while warm. On a side note, letting the car idle in the driveway or garage does nothing to warm up the trans fluid, that only happens when the car is actually in motion and shifting. Confused looks on the face of the service adviser told me all I needed to know there. On the plus side, the loaner car drives nicely and shifts smoothly. Although the loaner car has a horrible infotainment system that lags and freezes constantly, at least mine doesn't do that. Maybe it will though when it's out of the shop, we can be so lucky!

acura,rdx,2019,Steve S., 07/25/2018,Too Soon!,neu,"Enjoyed it while I had it, but after driving less than 25 miles and owning for under 3 hours, the Infotainment center flashed between the home screen and “touchpad is not available.”  After restarting, the Infotainment center screen was completely dead.  Volume/power button on console didn't work.  Now in a loaner while dealer diagnoses the problem.  Highly disappointed with Acura quality control as this is not an isolated incident.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Faye, 02/09/2019,Car released too soon,neg,"After owning this car for 6 months, I'm very disappointed.  It's my first and last Acura.  On a regular basis, I notice the gears aren't shifting smoothly, or are delayed shifting so the engine revs in the 3000-4000 RPM range for no reason.  It's not every time I drive the car but once is enough.  It appears that this may be a common problem on this car reading other reviews.  Looming transmission replacement???  I've told the dealer and their only response was ""we'll make a note"".  Also, if you have an Android phone...beware.  This car's infotainment system doesn't work with an Android.  They told me in August it would be a few months and they expected software update to come out in November.  The update was published in January but still didn't address the the Android problem.  Now they are saying April...maybe.  For 5 months (before the January update), I had systematic failure of the tuner to tune to a radio station when I started the car.  Sometimes, there would be non-working camera links or other infotainment system errors.  The automatic collision braking system is a joke.  Twice now, the automatic system took over while I was braking, but it forces the car to brake in maybe a 1' span and way before it's really necessary, literally grinding the car to a halt without warning.    The first time it happened, I had at least 8' or more of play in front of me.  And the car behind me hit me because they didn't anticipate the unnecessarily & immediate halting of my car.  I only see this automatic braking system causing more accidents than they were designed to prevent.  Gas mileage is not nearly as advertised, around 20mpg average.

acura,rdx,2019,Sean, 11/04/2018,Great SUV Ruined by Infotainment System,neu,"We've only had this car about three weeks, and so far this is the first new car purchase I've ever considered trying to find my way out of. First the good.... The way the car drives is fantastic. Great engine, although I'm not getting the advertised MPG. Not a big deal. It's close. The transmission is smooth so far, handling is great for the type of vehicle this is. It's quiet, it's comfortable, very good headlights etc. Again, the car side of the equation is wonderful. Now, the other side of this. The infotainment system in this car is garbage. It crashes from time to time, the Nav system is antequated. Cannot name addresses, searches come up empty. It runs at 1/4 mile resolution unless on a highway. Then it comes out a hair more. Still no good if you want to see the big picture. The radio will just say ""loading"" on startup sometimes. Requiring the power to by cycled. Sound is very inconsistent from source to source. Strange digital pops when talking over BT.  Everyday it's something new. All of this is while using Apple Car Play or an Android phone paired of BT. With some research, I've found many reporting the same issues. To top it off, dealers are helpless as there's no way for them to fixed this. This isn't new technology. Just new in this car, and regardless of price point it's shameful that it operates so poorly.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Michael, 08/06/2019,A bunch of lies,neg,"This car isn't what you think it is.  The onboard system is clunky with many issues, the MPG is 20% or worse lower than advertised, Android Auto is still in testing a year later, the gas tank is incredibly small and for the price the mirrors should fold in automatically.  Additionally, AcuraLink has never worked on my vehicle...I've given up on fixing it.

The only positives are the interior options and the SH-AWD, however the vehicle would been better off with a 6 cyl.

acura,rdx,2019,LiyaM, 08/30/2018,Comfort & Performance,pos,"Traded my 2012 RDX Tech (considered the loaded model) for the 2019 RDX Advance. Wanted the ASPEC for the rims but loaded like an Advace, so I got the black Advance with black interior and upgraded to black rims. It's a gorgeous car! It rides like a dream. I drove it out of state the second day I had it and it surpassed my expectations! The comfort was superb and handling on sport or sport+ mode was nice and tight. The seats are soft and supple. Loved the lane keep assist and cruise control features - the car sort of drives itself! The panoramic sunroof is a gorgeous addition. The touch pad gets easier to use with practice, but is a little frustrating at first. A few cons: a small space for coins would be nice as well as a bigger center console (my 2012 was much smaller but the center console was huge). Also, the navigation system needs an upgrade. There are portions of not so new roads where I was 'flying in the gray' on the screen because those roads weren't recognized. Had I not had my phone (Android) GPS on, I'd been lost.

acura,rdx,2019,California, 07/27/2018,Bad surprise,neu,"I owned 2 hondas before, which I loved.  About 1 momth ago bought a new Acura rdx SH-Awd 2019. Very comfortable, luxury looking.  To the bad surprise, over the past week I had two problems with acceleration, like I was stuck in traffic light or stop for some time, accelerating very slowly. Then 2 days ago my car would not accelerate at all, while revving at 5-6 rpm, barely moving on the road. I had to call towing. Now got a courtesy car from dealership, but they have not been able to identify the problem, saying now it works ok. I would not risk that type of failure on the busy freeway, so would not drive that car until problem is found. So Lynn, who wrote a review on 7/15, you are not the only “unlucky” person. It seems flaws are not due to luck at all, but rather due to manufacturer flows. I would not recommend buying these cars until more reports would start to come up, since everything is different in this new model, transmission, engine, etc. I am very disappointed.

acura,rdx,2019,Jay, 11/26/2018,Rough transmission transition when leaving,neg,"Looks like I’m not the only one who sensed rough transmission transition at low speed. I believe 2019 RDX has a serious transmission problem. I have a base model. The problem that I noticed is that when leaving my place in the morning with the temperature gauge stuck at the lowest position, the vehicle jerks when switching the gear to upper ones at low speed. As the temperature gauge bar appears as it’s warmed up, the abrupt transition of transmission becomes smoother. I tried warming up for 5 minutes before leaving and the problem was less severe. So this vehicle requires warming up as most of vehicles in 80s or 90s did. But remember you're buying a so-called luxury vehicle paying more than 40 grand in 2019. This is really hard to reproduce at dealer because by the time I arrive at dealer, the vehicle is already warmed up. People complained a lot about hard control of electronic system, but I don’t, it’s a matter of time to get used to it. Another issue is this 2019 RDX is gas greedy, usually I can get a little less than 23 mile/gallon but it requires 92 octane recommended. When I'm spending more money for high-end version and more gas with higher priced  octane gas, at least I didn't expect rattling or jerking of rough transmission transition.

acura,rdx,2019,CM, 12/11/2018,"So far, so good",pos,"My family loves this car and would buy it again; in fact, if we were replacing our second car today, we'd end up with two identical cars in the driveway. We evaluated every competing 2-row luxury SUV and chose this one mainly because it: 1. Offers the best interior space and comfort relative to exterior dimensions (including ample rear headroom and legroom); 2. Has the best mix of sporty luxury; 3. Has the freshest design and technology; 4. Offers the most competitive pricing, even when fully loaded. Noting only things that I haven't read about much in other excellent, comprehensive reviews: window defrost takes forever, even after starting the car remotely; the rear seats allow little adjustment/recline; lane-keeping assist has so little reliability that it adds nothing to vehicle convenience or safety (but adaptive cruise control with low speed follow works great); even with 50/50 suburban/highway driving, our gas mileage won't budge from 18.2.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Tank, 12/09/2018,Curb your expectations..,neu,"Okay, so this car is loaded with features... Keyless entry, Lane keep assist, collision mitigation, adaptive radar cruise control, backup camera, 10 speed dual clutch automatic transmission, auto engine start/stop, remote start (via phone app or optional 2 way remote), active noise cancelling, 16 speaker ELS surround sound, climate control, heated and cooled seats, all in a very affordable package. What is there not to like? Well, beginning with the fact that barely ANY of the aforementioned features actually work like one would expect, there's quite a bit... First, let's discuss it's ""safety features"".  The RDX's collision mitigation system only beeps at you and charges the brakes, however it does NOT actually stop the car regardless of speed or distance setting. The lane keep assist only reliably works on straight roads with perfect lines, so if you're coming up on an off-ramp, pay attention as it wants to take you off the exit. In addition, LKAS is only available at speeds of 45mph or above, so if there's any sort of traffic that brings your speed below 45mph, it just shuts off. The backup camera could also be better - not sure if it's the location of the camera itself but it is very very subject to any rain drops laying on the lens and subsequently blocking it's view (which only rarely happened on my other cars). Next onto the rest of the ""features"" like the remote start. Yes, you can start the car remotely, however your climate control settings are disabled until you get in. To be clear, the RDX definitely WILL heat and cool the cabin, but at an alarmingly slow rate. It uses it's lowest heating or cooling settings (not your preset temps). As expected, the heated/cooled seats are off until you get in the car so there's no reprieve there either on hot/cold days. The AcuraLink app works about 70% of the time for me. During the other 30%, it's asking me to register my car (again and again) or it's not available. I've had no issues with the keyless entry so far, aside from the fact that you cannot roll the windows up from the keyfob like almost every other late model car. You CAN however roll them down with the keyfob, just not remotely roll them back up?? The 10 speed transmission is next up on the quirky list. Since it's paired to a turbo v-tec 4, you will run into the occasion where the car shifts just as the torque band kicks in leading to an uncomfortable jerky ride... In comfort mode, the car really should skip every other gear... The active noise cancellation is also another oddity. It's hard to tell if it's actually working because it's just not that quiet compared to say a Q5, Lexus NX-RX, or even a Ford Edge. Engine note aside, the car does little to shield you from the road noise. The ELS sound system is actually quite good, but the lack of insulation in the car, noticeably hinders it's performance. A little resonance control in the door panels would have gone a long way. The infotainment center is next on my critique list. I'm not going to pass judgement on the ergonomics as I knew the shortcomings prior to purchase, however the lack of detailed control over the vehicle's many functions is almost disturbing to me. Just as with the Acura Link app, most of the functions of the infotainment system are relegated to either ON or OFF with little customization. So why buy this car? My opinion - buy it for it's SH-AWD which is amazing. Buy this car for it's strong engine and ""expected"" Honda reliability. Buy the car for it's roomy interior. Buy this car for it's looks. Whatever the reasoning may be, buying this car for the tech features should be last on the list. In that regard, there are much better offerings on the market today. Yes most of the competition out there would charge more, but I would much rather pay for something that works instead of something that doesn't. This car is the epitome of smoke and mirrors. By
 cramming a seemingly huge amount of features into an affordable package, the new RDX appears to be a steal. In reality, half of the features/options function as what one would expect but most buyers probably won't even notice. At least not until they have owned or test driven one of the competitor's vehicles..

acura,rdx,2019,Danny, 10/12/2018,Anyone Else Having Issues,pos,"Overall I love my SUV, however I noticed a few things that need to get checked. As I have seen in a few of these posts, the turbo lag is noticeable when at low speed, and then quickly accelerating, there is a substantial pause. Also, at low speeds, the gear shift from 1,2, and 3 are really abrupt. Even more abrupt when stopped on a hill, and just letting your foot of the brake to let the car roll. Another possible issue, when at certain speeds, it feels as though the car is (putting along), like the turbo is making the car shake. One last thing to note, when at high speeds (60, 70, 80) and braking, my SUV shakes, almost like the brakes are warpt. At first I thought it may be the transmission downshifting from so many gears, then I thought it was the breaks, and then possibly the turbocharger (putting) when the car is braking hard. Any thoughts? Anyone else experiencing this?
"
acura,rdx,2019,BZone, 02/25/2019,Extremely Nice Car...need to know a few tricks,pos,"After spending a considerable amount of time researching SUV's in this class and test driving them, without a doubt, this is the clear winner for me, for a few different reasons and while not perfect, what is important to me the RDX excelled in those areas.  There are a couple of tricks to know to get full benefit of the vehicle and I have only had it a few days so will continue to update as I learn more.  Comfort: Excellent, seats are extremely comfortable and very adjustable. The detail level control knob is a little ways back, so you might miss it.  It does a great job of showing on on-screen what parts of the chair you are adjusting and being a tall driver, it is nice that it extends out under the legs.  Another great feature is the seat cooling and heating has an auto feature that is awesome, it automatically adjusts the heating and cooling of the seat based on overall temperature.  Cabin is very quiet and audio is better than most of the other vehicles I tried.  THe 4 cylinder is a little noisier accelerating than the previous six cylinder, but is not a distraction.  My one caveat is that the hood does have a noticeable ridgelines and while not normally distracting, you do notice it.  Drivability: While there are not a lot of them around, I strongly recommend getting the AWD, it isn't just for bad weather, it drives nicer and I found out the 2 wheel drive doesn't come with a spare tire either...which is a $600 option.  Was cautious about the 4 cylinder at first, but it has plenty of power, and is fun to drive.  Tech: Very good, but takes a little getting used to the keypad...one thing I really like is that the display is wide so you can see quite a bit side by side.  For example, if you are using Apple Carplay, in our pilot it takes up the entire screen, but this one allows you to have apple car play on the main part of the screen and still see other things (like navigation if you want to use the built in navigation) next to it.  There are also a lot of niceties, for example, when you want to turn off the headlights because you are sitting in front of a store but want the vehicle to keep running, with most cars you have to turn it off and then remember to turn it back on.  With the RDX, you can just turn it off and it flips back to auto immediately and will turn them back on for you when you start moving again.  This is my first HUD and I found it to be very helpful and easier to see than some of the other vehicles I tried and it is very adjustable.  Access to USB, power, etc. is very good, but one improvement would be more of a dedicated place to store your phone...there is a place to put it, but nowadays, it just seems there should be a designated spot for it.  On another review in this thread, someone points out that you can't import your contacts.  You actually can, but there is a trick to it.  Once you connect via blutooth, you have to go to the device on the phone, press info, and then select the option to allow the phone to share contacts with that device.  I don't think that is an Acura specific thing so it shouldn't be held against them.  This model scores excellent on safety scores and am not willing to do a dummy test on my vehicle so will just have to trust the people that do those tests:)  On a last note, when purchasing the vehicle, I built it online first and selected the accessories I wanted, but when I got to the dealer, the prices were wildly different.  When I asked, they stated that those don't include the ""installation"" fees...so if you go to their parts department and show them the online prices they will match it and most things are easily installed by yourself."
acura,rdx,2019,Paul, 02/26/2019,My Blue Apex Pearl RDX: Awesome SUV,pos,"Reading over many unsatisfied customers, I am relieved that my own experience isn't the same.  I know how frustrating it is when your car doesn't function and live up to the value of the car.  I had some run-ins with my own MDX; minor issues that can mount to be real annoyance.  Nevertheless, this RDX has been awesome to drive and the engine's sound it produces is really nice; especially during cold starts, the engine hums with power.  I love it!  Although many others complained about the touch pad, my own experience has been very positive.  It took some time to get use to but the fixed position to control the infotainment is perfect and easy to use.  The ability to swap the split screen was an excellent decision by Acura.  The only annoyance with the navigation system is the fact the speech recognition software isn't very accurate.  When I tell it to navigate to a concern address, it often gets it wrong; I would have to repeat it several times before it gets it close.  Sometimes, the spoken address is completely wrong and doesn't get it right.  Having used the Acura system before, you need to make sure the city location is according to its own database.  Another minor issue with my car, is the rubber seal that surround my panoramic roof.  It doesn't leak but it is slightly off on the right side.  It looks like it is slightly more pressed in; potential problem of dust and dirt getting trapped in that space and eventually ending up in the water drain in the sun roof.  I may take it in to have service look at it.  Other than these very minor issues, nothing else to report.  Right now, it has nothing but joy to drive and enjoy the new car.

acura,rdx,2019,Unsatisfied customer, 09/27/2019,Computer system cannot be fixed,neg,"Do not get this car. I repeat. Do not get this car. The computer system is [non-permissible content removed]. The computer does not shut off when the car is off. The battery goes dead. Roadside assistance charges the battery. The dealer resets the system by unplugging the battery and reconnecting it. The same problem continues days later. There is no current fix. Acura states we do not know what to do,"
acura,rdx,2019,JinJJa, 08/27/2018,Everything is great except for the fuel economy.,pos,"I was one of the first 10,000 purchasers of this awesome SUV and just put in my first 1000 miles. The 2019 Acura RDX has exceeded all my expectations. It handles better than my C class Mercedes. It accelerates very quickly. It is very quiet and comfortable. It can haul LOT of cargo and every one loves the backseat room. It has awesome stereo (which takes 100 hours of play to break in). The SH AWD is just awesome on highways and high speed twisty roads. It also adds a LOT of fun to the ride. Some experts have panned its transmission but, in my opinion, it is better than good. The ONLY downside of this vehicle is that it does only 18.5 MPG combined. I do a fair amount of driving on the highways. That is significantly lower than the 24 MPG as advertised. It also has the highest safety rating possible form IIHS. The reliability remains to be seen. But I am loving this SUV so far.
"
acura,rdx,2019,DZ, 02/05/2019,Really regretting my purchase,neg,"I cannot begin to tell you how much I regret my decision to buy my 2019 RDX (Technology package).  What was “love at first sight” has turned into a “hate at first month” experience and this car is not living up to the Acura name and alleged “quality” at all.  I am so disappointed and frustrated with this vehicle and was not expecting all the issues I’ve had in the first 2 months of ownership.  If I could take it back I would.  Unfortunately for me I do keep my cars for a long time and with an expensive car like this one I’ll be stuck with it for long time.   The car is definitely great looking and stylish, but that’s where my “likes” start and end.  For the first month and a half of ownership I took it in 4 times, was in a loaner car for 1/3 of this time and now I have to take it in AGAIN because of other issues.  I started having issues at 1,500 miles and I now have 2,000 with more issues.  There are so many flaws with this car, but before I go into the actual issues that required and still require trips to the dealership, let me tell you about a few general complaints:
- The FM radio drives me NUTS and that’s because you never get consistent sound.  There is this “HD” signal that goes in and out when you drive and when that happens not all of the speakers work so the sound goes from loud to low and vice versa and it comes through different speakers as well.  It is SO ANNOYING that I can’t listen to my favorite radio stations at all.  You do have the option to turn off “HD” and only play analog, but when you do that you don’t get sound from the 12 speakers that they brag about so much.  So what’s the point of that many speakers if you can’t get them to play the sound???  Sorry Acura, but my 12 year Toyota Yaris had better radio sound than this.
- The lane departure feature entails an orange light that pops up on the dash.  How exactly is a “light” supposed to effectively get the driver’s attention if they “depart the lane” due to a distraction?  Have they not considered adding an option for a sound?  Yes, you shouldn’t expect a car to replace driver’s common sense, but a light certainly doesn’t “assist” with anything.
- The car did not come with all weather mats and the Acura ones suck.  I had to buy Weathertechs, I also had to buy a rubber mat for the trunk, etc.  How do you pay mid 40’s for a car and don’t get basic mats?  My best friend purchased an Outback a month before I purchased my car and for a car that was two thirds of the price of mine, she got EVERYTHING included – rubber mats, retractable trunk cover, etc.  I’d rather pay more and get it all instead of feeling nickled and dimed.
- Remote start did not come manufacturer installed and you have to order it separately OR you can pay an arm and a leg for a useless app.  Why?  Again, if the car was in the $20-$30 K range that’s fine, but these cars are not cheap.
- Infotainment system is HORRENDOUS – trying to write with your finger or type is a nightmare.  I hate everything about the infotainment system and I will leave it at that.
- You can’t lift your wipers.
- I don’t care as much about the mileage because I bought the car for the performance and style, but I wanted to point out that the “mileage” that was published for this car was pulled out of thin air … 19 mpg has been my max.
So here is a list of the things that I have taken my car in for and will be taking it in again this week:
1) Infotainment system not working – I would get the blue disclaimer screen that would stay on at all times even when I stopped and locked the car.  My husband had to pull a fuse so my battery doesn’t die overnight.  I have also had the infotainment screen go completely blank for days.   I’ve taken my car in twice for this issue and they still don’t have a permanent fix.  The Service Manager even joked and told me that if it happens again at least I know which fuse to pull.  Excuse me,
 I did not pay an arm and a leg for a car to pull a fuse at 1,500 miles, this is not what I signed up for.
2) Auto stop/start – after I picked up my car from the dealer when I took it in for the screen issues, I now have and hear this loud awful clunky sound when the car re-starts.  In addition, the auto stop/start engages whenever it feels like it.  I took the car back to the dealer, but they couldn’t reproduce the sound at that time so I’m stuck driving a car that makes this loud noise when the auto stop disengages.
3) Break sound – my car now makes this awful break noise when I release the breaks after coming to a full stop.  Once again I have no ideas why and how this is happening so I have to take the car in again.
Story of my life … I somehow have this awful feeling that this will be the story of my Acura car ownership.  For Acura’s sake I hope the rest of the owners have better experience than mine.

acura,rdx,2019,Tammy, 04/16/2019,One month in wish I could get my money back,neu,"I purchased the Acura RDX AWD Advanced Package after looking for a new vehicle for several months. I was driving a 2012 BMW X3 that I customer ordered and purchasing in the fall of 2011. I was cautious going from a V6 to an inline 4 turbo. That concern was not merited. I have no issues with power or performance of my new Acura. I actually really like the HUD and the blind spot monitors. The car is luxurious and drives great. So what's my problem? The infotainment. For 50k I should be able to play music without an issue. Initially thinking the problem was me and it was just a learning curve, my 22 and 19 yr old children said ""mom its not you"". The car has been at the dealer twice now for service, only 819 miles on the car. The screen goes blank, at times it freezes and wont play anything at all. Yesterday I selected my country playlist and the system played my disco playlist. If I get a text message or phone call while driving forget it, the entire system goes astray. They removed the CD player in this model so playing a CD is not an option I have to rely on a USB or my phone for my music. Dealer says nothing is wrong. When researching for a new vehicle I knew there were early issues with the infotainment but thought they had been resolved. Sounds silly but it is not. This is a lot of money for a new car and I drive my vehicles for a long time.

acura,rdx,2019,Irvguy50, 03/04/2019,Very nice SUV.,pos,"So I've only had my 2019 Rdx Aspec a week now. Not in l love with the road departure mitigation system. Dont like my steering wheel shaking.  Also, the automatic stop/start engine. Not a fan! My thinking is what if the engine doesnt start at an intersection. Then I'm left stranded. Also, this has to cause wear and tear on the starter. So, last but not least I had the lane keeping assist off and I felt like there was play in the steering. I had a hard time holding it in the road on the highway doing 70. Not sure what this was all about. May have to reach out to the dealership on this one if it keeps up. Also, the sports+ mode seems.like it revs up the engine to 3k rpm. Feels like it's not shifting when it should. Kind if stresses me out for  something I've paid 45k for. Positves: the body style is spot on. I have the white & black. It really reminds me off a Evoque. The interior- love it. The look is awesome and the dual moon roof.. love it!! I hope these issues subside within a few weeks. Thought Acura would have done their home work better before releasing this vehicle. We also have a 2018 Rdx tech pkg and I love that vehicle..
"
acura,rdx,2019,Nick Z, 06/23/2018,Great luxury compact SUV! NOT!!!,neg,"The title says it all!  I've had my RDX for a couple weeks and love everything about it, except it lacks some of the things the Canadian Elite Platinum model has:  power folding mirrors, puddle lights, temp control for the rear seats, headlight washers, and articulating headlights.  I would have gladly paid more for those features for my RDX, but sadly no such option for this model year that I know of.  Fit and finish is top notch, and I got 27.2 on the Interstate right out of the box.  The 3D audio system is excellent, but only ""discrete"" surround; not true 5.1 or 7.1 surround I had in my loaded '16 Lexus RX 350 I traded in.  Big disappointments are the lack of a CD player, and wireless phone charger.  The RDX's is really peppy even using regular 87 octane gas.  It looks like the RDX is a keeper for at least a couple of years.

Update:  On 1 January 2019 the RDX went into “limp mode”.  Long, long story, Honda/Acura refused to acknowledge there was a serious problem even with numerous complaints to NHSTA.  Consequently, I sold the RDX at the end of April 2019 for a BIG loss.  Of course, the RDX is now under recall for a bad fuel pump.  As a consequence I will never buy or recommend a Honda or Acura product ever again.

Once for the sensor just randomly going off. And twice for the struts, suspension, and shocks that had to be completely replaced!! I regret this purchase!
"
acura,rdx,2019,Slack, 09/02/2018,Disappointed in my 2019 RDX,neu,"I traded in my 2009 Acura TL 3.5L V6 Tech Pkg sedan for the 2019 RDX Advance.  I loved almost everything about my TL including its acceleration, sound system, and ride.  However, I wanted a vehicle that I could enter & exit without bending so low.  All the reviewers on YouTube & in print seemed to have high praise for the new RDX, so I made the change after a couple test drives.  I've had the vehicle only a couple of weeks and I'm already regretting my purchase.  It is fun to drive, but I've had several issues.  On my second day, Apple CarPlay wouldn't work.  Then after pairing my iPhone X to the Bluetooth, my contacts were not available.  So I hard reset my phone, reset the infotainment system to factory default and that seemed to fix the problem for the moment.  After about 450 miles of mixed driving, I'm averaging about 17.5 mpg.  You read it right - 17.5 mpg, and mostly in Comfort mode with no redlining.  I'm going to conduct a highway only test soon, but I don't expect to get the advertised mpg.  Yesterday, my monitor stopped working, as did the auto idle feature ( even though I don't particularly care for it, it should work!)  Aside from features not working, I am disappointed in the turbo lag.  It has almost caused an accident because I couldn't get out of the way of an oncoming car while turning at a traffic light.  That's beyond inconvenient.  Anyway, I will probably trade it next year for a more proven vehicle.  Fortunately, this is the first time I have had this much trouble with a new vehicle, so I'm lucky, but I cannot recommend this with all its initial problems.

UPDATE:  After 4000+ more miles and seven months, I’m still regretting my choice.  I took the car to the dealership because when the auto engine idle stop restarted the engine, it would release the electric brake hold, causing my car to move forward while at traffic stops.  Fortunately I was able to manually brake before rear ending the car in front of me.  Also, the auto engine idle stop engaged so often that it drained my battery within six months! Prior to purchasing the vehicle, I was assured that this feature would not affect battery life.  So, the technician decided to kill two birds with one stone.  He retuned/reset auto engine idle stop so that now it doesn’t engage at all!  So that should save the new battery and eliminate the release of electronic brake hold since there is no engine restart now.  While I don’t necessarily miss the idle feature, that’s how Acura achieved its EPA mileage ratings, which were already overstated.  Now, I’ll get even less mileage per gallon.  And, as many owners have commented, Apple CarPlay still only works intermittently.  It’s mostly useless because it drops in the middle of apps.  In fairness, I did get up to 27 MPG on a recent road trip, so I guess the highway gear ratios work well if in steady traffic.  But as soon as I returned to mixed driving, the MPG returned significantly less than advertised.  I’m pretty sure this will be my last Acura and that’s unfortunate because I really liked my 2009 TL.  Had this new architecture worked well, and assuming it would be migrated to the MDX in 2020, I had thought about upgrading in a year or two.  That plan is moot now.

ONE YEAR LATER:  I’ve owned the 2019 RDX for a year now and most of my original review still holds.  The infotainment system is still problematic with Apple CarPlay only staying connected intermittently, and glitches in the nav system have the head up display (HUD) showing upcoming turns opposite those on the nav screen.  The nav voice prompt often agrees with the HUD’s incorrect direction.  Even with most recent firmware update, many problems still exist.  The turbo lag/transmission lag on quick passing acceleration situations is still annoying.  I often have to quickly downshift to prevent getting broadsided by an oncoming vehicle.

I still love the
 ride and handling of the RDX.  I call it my big sports car when in sport+ driving mode.  The driver’s seat and leg room are very comfortable for a midsize SUV.  The sound system is the best I’ve ever had in a car, and aside from the HUD losing its mind occasionally, I love that feature.  As to whether I’ll buy another Acura, probably not.  Acura does not seem interested in addressing these complaints by 2019 RDX owners.  Whatever I purchase next will have a more reliable infotainment system in which Apple CarPlay works.

It is the same as my hubby's GX460 which is a V8!  Engine is noisy even a mild pushing of gas pedal.   My old 2016 RDX could easily do 22mpg even 28 mpg on highway!   Why Acura all of a sudden going backward is beyond me, but if anyone out there has a low mileage 2018 V6 RDX I will trade mine with you!!!!

acura,rdx,2019,Scarlette, 03/27/2019,Loved it and now I regret It,neg,"I have had my new RDX for 4 months. I have 5k miles on it. Gear shifting is spotty. Brakes scream. Suspension crunches and squeaks when you go over bumps. I’m driving a brand new car the rides and sounds like a 15y/o car. Dealership tells me Acura is aware of all these issues but head quarters won’t let them fix it till there is an official recall. They are not sure what is causing it yet. My screen freezes and fails all the time. To protect myself I started videoing all the noises and issues. Now they are taking me more seriously! This is my 3rd time at service and it’s really hard not to tell the couple in the show room to run! I loved this car and I’m truly disappointed by it. When everything is working it’s amazing, but that’s a rare occurrence. Sorry for typos I’m on my phone and I am truly aggravated that I am sitting her at the dealership yet again.

acura,rdx,2019,Frank Callahan, 08/07/2018,Get What You Pay For,pos,"This is my first Japanese car. My family has historically owned German vehicles, which we had been very happy with. I had seriously considered buying another German car, but for comparison, thought I would look at Lexus and Acura. Did not like the Lexus RX 350 but was impressed with the Acura RDX during respective test drives. Comparing it to the Audi Q5, the RDX was $15K less expensive and that was the motivating factor for me. However, having driven the RDX now for two weeks I can say that it is not a smooth and comfortable a ride as the Audi (which y wife currently drives). Also, during my purchasing analysis, I liked the idea of the 10-gears in the RDX transmission. However, I find the car is constantly shifting and looking for the ""right"" gear. This is particularly apparent when I am in traffic. The seats are very comfortable and the interior luxurious. Does the $15K savings offset the car's shortfalls? I'm not sure and probably need more time with the vehicle to answer confidently.

acura,rdx,2019,G. Madia, 08/12/2018,First week with RDX Advance package.,pos,"I researched a lot of vehicles and the level of items included in my Advance trim RDX is unmatched for the given price level (< $46k). The ride is solid, the interior is quiet and built with quality materials. The multi adjusting drivers seat is outstanding, the HUD is great and the sound system in the Advance package is unreal. My only complaint thus far is the finger pad that controls the center console can be a bit confusing and trying to input an address in the Nav system was problematic. I instead used voice control and the system nailed the address on the first try. Finally, the LKAS only notifies you of lane drift via vibration and visual cues I wish it also adjusted the steering wheel to keep you in the lane like my wife's new Volvo does..but then again the sticker price on the Volvo was $15k higher.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Pauli E, 06/24/2019,Not Ready for Prime Time,neg,"If you are thinking of buying a 2019 RDX, do yourself a favor. Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the operation of the Infotainment system on YouTube or some other resource so that you can put it through its paces when you take a test drive.

The infotainment system is bad, really bad. First, it is EXTREMELY SLOW. I can’t believe that during the design phase, a manager looked at the responsiveness and said “Good work - Yes, this is fine”!  Many operations take 15 – 30 seconds, and if the “circle of confusion” (the Processing indicator” on the display screen) is spinning for more than approximately 30 seconds, there is a good chance that the operation you thought was simply taking a LONG time will abort with a “System Unavailable” message or some other such nonsense.  How can the system be unavailable? I was just trying to change the radio station!  

All sorts of miscellaneous bugs – intermittent at that!   The system also frequently gets into a locked up situation where the “circle of confusion” spins for several minutes, blocking you out from using the system during that time. MANY MANY BUGS. The most recent on my vehicle – the one that pushed me over the edge to write this review -  Sirius XM was on station “X”. I commanded the system, via voice to switch to “Sirius Channel “Y”.  After the excruciatingly long delay that is common when issuing voice commands, the system reports that it had switched to station “Y”. Guess what?  Radio was still on station “X”!!   And to make things worse, the up-down hard channel buttons on the dash did nothing either. Of course, I hit them several times trying to get them to work. I finally gave up.  About four minutes later, the radio starts jumping up and down the channel list, apparently in response to the up down button presses I had issued SEVERAL MINUTES EARLIER (and did I mention that the reason I was using the hard channel buttons was because the voice command didn’t work!!)   As far as other bugs, they are too numerous to document here, many of them bizarre like the one described above. Do your own research.

I am writing this review on 6-24-19, and I have the latest software version (d1.1.2). The car has been out for a year.  Based on that, I am not hopeful of rapid resolutions to these software bugs, and I don’t know how they will ever address the slow response issue. The last RDX software update was issued Feb 13, 2019. Take a look at the HUGE list of bugs in the link below supposedly fixed in that release.   And no updates since then?????
https://owners.acura.com/Documentum/ota/2019_RDX.pdf


There now appears to be a Class Action suit on 2019 RDX Infotainment System - 
Google     “2019 Acura RDX class action suit”  for details.
Looks like some customer are done waiting for Acura to fix these bugs.

This is Consumer Report’s take on the RDX’s Infotainment System:  “One of the worst we have encountered recently”. And they were just talking about the “user friendliness” aspect of the system, not the slowness and buggy nature that would have eventually cropped up.

How prevalent are these problems? A search online shows, that in desperation, RDX owners have resorted to temporarily disconnecting the battery, pulling fuses, and the “Three finger reset”:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7uLCjHK-cU


Regarding Acura’s new  ”True Touch” design, the idea is supposed to be that your eyes are higher up, and therefore, it is a safer system. But the overly complex and confusing user interface, combined with the fact that you are touching one location and viewing another, and lastly navigating through the bug prone and slow performance of the system, totally erases any advantage the higher view screen allegedly provides.  This system is INFINITELY more distracting than my other car, which has a simple touch screen with a simple interface  and VERY QUICK response.
And if you use Apple Play,
 the True Touch paradigm is no longer is even applicable!!!!  – you are now dragging the cursor! A simple and reliable touch screen would have been WAY WAY better in my opinion.

The car itself rides nice, but the aggravation with the slow response and a new bug popping up every couple of days totally takes the fun out of owning a new (luxury) car. Every time the “Circle of Confusion” rears its ugly head on this new 50K luxury car, it’s more salt in the wound.

Other Issues:
Gas mileage is poor, the front parking sensors do not work, and the keyless entry sometimes does not work!  The rear camera is useless when wet. The brakes are “grabby” when wet or damp. The Adaptive Cruise Control is too aggressive with the brakes, more so that if you were using a standard cruise control, so I just use Cruise Control with the Adaptive Feature turned off.

All new models have SOME growing pain, but the Infotainment system definitely would be a deal breaker if I had to do it again.

acura,rdx,2019,RK, 10/17/2018,Great SUV,pos,"First the positive...Love the ride/handling/power of this vehicle.Drives like a sports sedan.Love driving it.Turbo hesitation not very evident to me.The cargo space in the car is just right,seats very comfortable..especially on trips.

     Now to the one not -so - positive.....The engine turn off at idle drives me crazy...I hope they come up with an override for this because you have to press a button every time starting the car to turn it  off.      .....All in all ,it's still a really fine SUV and I would absolutely buy it again.The price is great compared to other premium SUVs with the same equipment.

acura,rdx,2019,Damion G, 02/07/2019,Biggest vehicle purchase regret ever,neu,"I read all the car magazine reviews that the new RDX was an amazing new vehicle and a great value.  Boy, are they wrong!  This has been the biggest mistake I've made with a vehicle purchase.  As soon as I got it home I washed the RDX by hand and realized there are numerous paint defects.  Too many to list.  Also the whole car has way too much orange peel in the paint.  My local body shop looked at it and said there was something wrong when they sprayed it and he was surprised they let it out of the factory that way. 2nd issue, the audio system doesn't work. This is noted in almost every review.  I didn't know that going in, or I wouldn't have bought it. 3rd, after a month and 1300 miles, the car breaks down. It had a Cylinder 1 misfire.  They said one of the on board computers had a virus and crashed causing the engine to run rough.  4th, the mileage is horrible!  My 2016 Tahoe could get this or better gas mileage.  I am so pissed at Acura right now.  The dealership I bought it from has been terrible.  They are avoiding me now.  They won't return calls or anything.  I want to get rid of this thing so bad, I don't know what to do.  Other dealerships have told me they don't want it.  Trade offers are very low.  Don't waste your money on the new RDX.

acura,rdx,2019,LightSPD, 08/01/2018,"Great drive, nav system unusable",neg,"2019 RDX is sporty to drive...very responsive, quiet, handles well.  The major flaw is the navigation system.  It defaults to a screen scale of 1 inch = 3/4 of a mile and the scale can't be changed.  Also, you can't name favorites for the frequent places you visit.  I have spoken to Acura tech support and these are known deficiencies in the system.  They were unable to commit to a software upgrade to get it fixed in the future.  I use  the apple carplay feature now for nav, but then you lose all the integration niceties with the other systems......makes a great car a bummer.

acura,rdx,2019,Eastern PA Driver, 08/26/2018,Best Bang for the Buck,pos,"The newly designed RDX is almost perfect.  Starting from the looks and exterior to the interior fit and finish the vehicle is top notch. I chose the base model because it had everything I needed. I did not want to spend a whole lot for the bells and whistles (though I would have if I didn't have two kids in college). The engine is very responsive with excellent power. The electronics is superb. My IPhone works seemlessly with the cars bluetooth. The voice recognition is very good in spite of my accent. As others have mentioned the touch pad does need getting used to.  Once you get the hang of it,  it seems the most logical thing to do as far as safety.  The seats are extremely comfortable with lumbar support (front). My only suggestion is that the base model should have included the blind spot monitoring - now only higher models come with it.  I love the vehicle. It is not cheap but I think it is the best value in a luxury compact SUV.

acura,rdx,2019,Suz, 02/02/2019,Save your money until 2020,neu,"I purchased one of the first RDXs in June 2018. While the interior and exterior look nice, there are countless electronic issues. I have spent hours working with the dealer and Acura corporate. It was a lesson learned the hard way to not purchase a newly released vehicle. The steering wheel controls don't always work, the monitor had outages and it does not work in the cold weather. They claim these issues may be fixed with system update 2 but after waiting months for the first update (and it didn't fix all the issues), I'm not holding my breath. Wait until next year, this one is not worth it.

Update Feb 2020 - ongoing issues with the vehicle. I would not recommend it if electronics are important to you. Had a total outage of infotainment system and system controls, makes for a scary experience.

acura,rdx,2019,Darcee , 08/03/2019,Continues to be Nothing but trouble,neg,"Acura was well aware of the many kinks in this vehicle prior to releasing it. Shame on them. It's a beautiful car,  but I've had nothing but trouble with the infotainment system and system errors. I would basically live at the acura service center if I took it in every time I got an error.  Brakes  intermittently squeak. Another problem they are aware of. I've never been able to achieve the advertised gas mileage. The ventilated seats..well to get any cooling worthwhile you need air conditioning fan on high, which is so loud it sounds like you are in a wind machine. I've had this vehicle in for service more times in under a year, first time was about 3 weeks after purchase,  than I did in all of 12 years owning various Infiniti vehicles.

acura,rdx,2019,Jennifer, 03/15/2019,I want to give this car back,neu,"I was so excited to get this new 2019 RDX it’s fully loaded and handles great and is a beautiful car. But now so disappointed in Acura for putting a vehicle on the market before they got the bugs out. So many electrical issues and they don’t know how to fix them. Let’s start by saying it’s garage kept and I take very good care of my autos. Within 2 months this car has had to be jumped twice but no one knows why as we’ve found nothing left on. I have no small kids that could have left something on, they really don’t know what it could be. The brakes squeak terribly and they are currently working to find a solution, gas mileage is terrible and no where close to what they advertise. I’m getting avg of 19.3 overall and 21.2 if I do highway only driving. It has a small gas tank so I find myself constantly filling up. They have lied and totally misrepresented gas mileage. Next problem is toggle button doesn’t work 85% of the time. Now obviously this isn’t a safety issue however I expect everything I paid for on this car to work. I constantly get a message saying function unavailable. At times on/off button won’t work, app button won’t work and volume control. I just picked my car up yesterday for dealer to tell me there was an update out there that fixed my issue. Before leaving the parking lot guess what the button doesn’t work. They have no clue what to tell me as Acura has no solutions. The dealership is great but their hands are tied because no one knows how to fix these issues. I’ve paid $47,000 for a vehicle full of disappointments. I’d like to sell it but I can’t do that with items not working. Warning don’t buy this vehicle until they get their issues fixed or you will be frustrated as well.

acura,rdx,2019,Jsladin, 10/04/2018,Serious problem after 30 miles,neg,"I have always had Acura’s or Honda’s.  I loved the new RDX for the first four days. Then the entire electrical system failed and the steering wheel completely locked up. Fortunately I had already exited the highway and was in a parking lot. When I called the dealers service that’s when everything  went downhill. Now I will never trust an Acura nor will I trust their service.  Highly disappointed.

acura,rdx,2019,Jedd, 03/23/2019,My first and last Acura,neg,"I bought my 2019 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech in October 2018. I was excited at first but the excitement was soon replaced with frustration over harsh transmission shifting between 1st and 2nd, and then again from 2nd to 3rd gears. I then found that the brakes would squeal and resonate so badly that the entire cabin would vibrate. Then it was the Infotainment system. It regularly locks up when trying to change stations regardless of the fact that Acura has sent over the air updates to try to address the issue. Having worked in technology for over 30 years, I can tell you that in my opinion, Acura skimped on the processor and ram that is badly needed to make this system work the way it should. The icing on the cake for me was when I went to check the oil and found that gas had made its way into the oil to the point where the level was over the plastic measuring indicator on the stick. After some research online, I found that all of these issues are known issues. Acura has acknowledged them to me (with the exception of the oil fuel mixing) during service visits and claim that ""they are working on a fix"" which was documented in my receipts.  The oil/fuel mix issue is now beginning to be heavily discussed in Acura forums.  I traded mine in this past week.  My experience with Acura has taught me to not consider them again when it's time for something new.
"
acura,rdx,2019,RT, 03/28/2019,Traded after 6700 miles,neu,"RDX has a lot of potentially great technology, unfortunately far too much of it is poorly implemented.  The things I found lacking that, in aggregate, caused me to move on to something different.  

- Windshield and rear hatch glass both had crazing between the glass layers that was visible when light hit at a certain angle.  

- Infotainment system in general was second class with basic functions either poorly implemented or missing entirely, as well as being slow to respond to input.  

- Noisy interior except for highway driving.  

- Adaptive cruise control was slow to react to a vehicle in front.  Rather than gradually slowing it would wait until the last second then brake the vehicle.  When traffic resumed speed the RDX would do a near full throttle acceleration back to the set speed.  

- Oil being diluted with gasoline (MAJOR PROBLEM).  

- Transmission slow to shift into and out of reverse.  

-  Transmission shifting was erratically rough.  Some days it was good, other days not so much so.  

-  10 Speed transmission made for a very 'busy' experience when driving in stop and go traffic.  By the time the speed got up to 35MPH it was in 7th gear and you feel every shift. 

- Brake squealing/grinding, it's inconsistent and seems to be temperature/humidity related.

acura,rdx,2019,BT, 02/15/2019,2019 RDX A-Spec. Poor infotainment performance,neg,"Technology systems experience random failures, at various times sometimes when driving. Functionality can sometimes be restored by stopping the car and restarting the engine. Sometimes the vehicle must sit for hours with engine off to restore functionality. System failures include dashboard lighting, vehicle display screen, and heads-up display. Numerious dealer visits have provided no solution till today when I was informed that that this is a software issue and that a software vehicle update is required. However this is not available, has not been available for around since November 2018 when I bought my car and no timeline has been offered for this update. I regard this as a safety and driver distraction issue that can lead to collisions. Acura needs to place a higher priority on this issue in order to provide owners with a safer driving environment.

acura,rdx,2019,wayne wallace, 10/07/2018,I would not buy again,neu,"I owned a 2014 RDX and after 120,000 of virtually trouble free miles I was excited to purchase a 2019 with all its technology and performance hype.  I have already a turbo air cooler come off causing me to be all but stranded on the side of the road. Despite the performance hype the turbo 4 in no way out performs the silky smooth previous v-6 and gas millage is horrible.  My v6 would easily run on mid-grade gasoline and deliver 24 mpg on weekly commute. The 2019 runs on Premium fuel and barley get 21mpg. The lack of power is sometimes scary when pulling out in traffic. Don't be fooled by a transmission that has 10 speeds and constantly lets the engine freely rev, look at the speedometer and you will realize you haven't actually sped up to the speed you think you have. I anticipate an investigation into HP and TQ claims as they must have been falsified. I do like the technology and ride of the vehicle and it handles more like a sports car than a SUV but the lack of power and constant transmission shifts are pure annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Pierce Newton, 07/24/2018,Best ever,pos,"My wife calls me a serial car buyer because I have bought so many new cars. The black ASpec is the best yet. I did a lot of research and the thing I was concerned about was the touch pad interface. I'm 70 years old and not very computer savvy. My concerns were not justified. The system is easy to use even for me. I love the majestic black pearl paint with red interior. I usually drive in the Sport mode but Sport+ is awsome. We just made a 1500 mile trip to south Texas and the car (and auto cooling seats!) Performed perfectly. Gas milage was about 28 round trip and the seats very comfortable. I wish the HUD had been available in the A-Spec but I just had to have those red seats! A sports car masquerading as an SUV!

acura,rdx,2019,S Werner, 02/13/2019,Defective XM Radio in all 2019 RDX,neu,"When starting the car or turning on the XM Radio, the monitor indicates that it is ""loading""  This can load for 3 to 5 minutes before the XM Radio controls are functional. I consider this to be a defect as the radio is not operating what most users would consider to be normal.   I first talked to the dealer. The dealer confirmed that this was a wide spread problem. The dealer said is was a know problem and that Acura had not issued a fix or any infomration on if or when a fix was coming.  I wrote to Acura to share with them that I was not satisfied with the operation of the XM Radio.  Today Acura Client Relations responded after a considerable delay:  "" Dear xxxxxxx,

acura,rdx,2019,John , 05/22/2019,Disappointed,neu,"I traded in my leased 2016 RDX (which I absolutely loved) for the 2019 after seeing all the cool new features, especially the new Info system.  I hate to say it but I have had nothing but problems since driving it off the lot back in March.  The whole screen freezes on a regular basis...this has happened 3 times now...while I am driving.  It's very distracting as its totally unexpected.  I usually try to play with it trying to get it to work again...NOT SAFE...as I am not watching the road,  The last time I took it to the dealer they showed me how to reset it by pulling the fuse out and plugging it back in.  It's crazy that this is the solution for a $40,000 car.  I tried contacting Acura and they said all I can do is keep bringing it in to the dealer until there is a recall...which isn't guaranteed.  Really?  The transmission sticks, it's not as smooth as my 2016 (I miss my V6), and the controls on my steering wheel sometimes work and sometimes doesn't.  Unless Acura starts helping us with these issues, I don't see myself getting another one once this lease is up.  I have been a Honda/Acura customer since 1999...and have nothing but great experiences until now.  Truly disappointed. :("
acura,rdx,2019,PhillipK, 07/06/2019,90% buyers remorse,neu,"Honestly, this vehicle runs very well, good power, good handling and good looks. I have had 3 Lexus vehicles in the past with almost total satisfaction. My one and only reason to move over to Acura is the SH-AWD which Lexus shamefully does not offer. The Acura technology is shameful, the designer should be fired. In my opinion he is as dumb as they get. I have used a GPS from the beginning of time and have never come across one that a destination could not be named. Who in there right mind could come up with something so stupid? Does Acura expect us to remember an address without a name? Words cannot explain the dumbness of that idiot designer. The unit has to be told at least 3 before it understands your destination and in most cases it fails so you have to input the address manually. The dumb unit also lacks memory, only 30 destinations can be stored. (Lexus 100 named locations)I think that the designer or designers for the infotainment system needs a job at McDonald's, he definitely lacks common sense. I would hope that in the near future that Acura looks elsewhere to redesign the software for the RDX. Did anyone do any R&D before releasing such inadequacy?  In today's market most prestigious vehicles have puddle lights or rather approach lighting. where is yours Acura?  Cabin lighting is also inadequate. Overhead cameras are becoming the norm, where is yours Acura? Why should the Canadian market get Folding outside mirrors and the USA, your largest consumer not have it. I have a 3 car garage and it take some skill to get this car in without hitting the mirrors. Mirrors cannot be even purchased as an option, I would pay whatever a reasonable cost would be for folding mirrors. What about cornering lights, was that given any thought? Even the low end Japanese cars offer reclining rear seats, Maybe I am in error, I should say well thought out vehicles like Hyundai Santa Fe offer all the bells and whistles. Hyundai gets a 4.8 customer rating comparison with RDX 3.5, Isn't that shameful. Acura is supposedly a high end Honda.
The rest of the tech package like lane departure, accident mitigation, lane keep and so on are not aggressive as other vehicles that I have driven, which in my opinion is in adequate. Therefore I would conclude by saying that Acura is missing the boat on good technology, maybe they should take a closer look at Subaru  (Excellent technology, Eyesight seems to work so much better and less prone to accident catastrophe)
Again, I will admit that the Acura drives very well and has not exhibited any transmission, shut downs or Christmas tree dash boards as others have experienced. I was willing to  rent a car for 3 months until the Subaru Outback with the 2.4 Turbo arrived. My vehicle is moving to the islands next year so a good AWD is important to me. I really hope that Acura is going to update the software on this vehicle. I will update my review as I pack on the miles, I did try to return the vehicle after one day of ownership, but Acura South Florida would not accept.

acura,rdx,2019,Charlee Smith, 09/13/2018,A Perfect RX Repacement,pos,"For one month we have been owners of a RDX Advance (Performance Red/Parchment) and really couldn't be happier with our first Acura.  For three years we have been looking for a replacement for my wife's 2006 Lexus RX 330.  The options were narrowed down to the XC-60, QX50, RX and the RDX.  The XC-60 was eliminated on price and the fact that not only is Volvo Chinese owned, but the vehicles currently in the US are made in China.  The QX50 was eliminated on price and a dated interior with a very cheap sliding cover for the center storage area.  We drove the RX and the RDX within the same hour.  The RX didn't demonstrate one advantage over the RDX, and was over $8K more.  The front end styling of the RX also didn't help it.
We have yet to feel any situation in the RDX where we wished for more power.  The new True Touchpad is unique, but it takes less than 15 minutes to adapt to it and is superior.  I was able to program the primary home screen so that 98% of the functions my wife will use are available with one touch.  The voice control for the navigation has been flawless so far.  With part of the money we saved, our dealer added the 20"" diamond-cut wheels to top off its good looks.
My wife is hard to please, and one minor detail can kill a deal.  She loves every feature of the RDX so far.  Any complaint has been remedied with the options available for most functions.  Its floating center console design provides more side leg room and storage than any of its competitors.  With its top safety rating added to the fact that the RDX was designed in California and Ohio and is assembled in Ohio with 60% North American parts, we have no regrets.
After over a year now, over the air updates have corrected minor flaws in the infotainment system and our RDX has never needed a trip back to an Acura dealer.  It still looks good as new and has provided all the cargo capacity we have ever needed.  We are very happy with our first Acura!  We probably would have been just as happy with a new RX, but that would have cost us an additional $8K.
Update March 2020:  With the over the air updates, the infotainment system is much faster and has been working perfectly. The vehicle continues to operate without any glitches and has never required a trip back to our dealer.

acura,rdx,2019,Mr. Rendon, 06/26/2018,"Some yay, some nay....",pos,"Traded in a 2016 AWD Tech and overall happy with the upgrade and i expect it to be just as reliable but in the long run the proven V6 and 6speed seem bulletproof.  I also cant explain why the outgoing model was quicker and more efficent.  The 19’s brakes have been noisy since day 1 with the dealer not able to reproduce the noise(go figure). I also dont like the infotainment unless using apple car play. Acceleration and handling are superb but in Puerto Rico the streets are pretty bad and the sportiness quickly turns rough. Another plus are the headlights but they are to bright for oncoming traffic.
"
acura,rdx,2019,RedAcura, 02/09/2019,Transmission smoking/broken after 4k miles,neu,"My husband and I bought this car to replace my 2008 Lexus RX350 which was starting to need too many things replaced after 200,000 miles of loyal service. We are busy people so wanted a reliable, comfortable, spiffy SUV with good acceleration and handling for passing and twisty northern CA roads, plus freeway stretches,  Apple Car Play integration to easily  and reliably listen to audiobooks or radio, safely receive and make calls, plus extra tech of assisted cruise control, blind spot alerts, and lane drift protections. A new Lexus had everything except Car Play integration and was a bit slower on acceleration, so we passed on that and hoped a new Acura would  be as reliable as 1998 sedan we had for 10 years. We landed up paying top $ at a SF Bay area dealer after a lot of headaches  to get the color and features we wanted (red, Tech and Advance package, AWD) after some unpleasant dealings and misrepresentations by unsavory sales managers. It took a while for me to get used to the unnecessarily busy and overly complicated, small print controls, the next to useless Acura Navigation (avoiding it) , and the Car Play pseudo-integration. I thought I was getting the hang of everything and had workarounds, until Car Play navigation started periodically freezing up and became frequently slow to launch or didn't launch at all (giving an ""unavailable"" notice) or crashing after a loud sound at  unpredictable and awkward times. Sometimes it would start up again the next day, sometimes simultaneously disabled the Acura nav and radio at the same time, annoying on long stretches of highway. One morning I noticed  a fine, semi-circular crack in the upper windshield near the cameras  (was not off-roading and there was no pebble mark) .  The last straw was when we smelled and saw smoke coming out from the car under the passenger side hood and right wheel area. We took it to the dealer and after initial attempts to brush off issues as ""never heard of this before"" and trying to set up scenarios that would blame the customer, we insisted they look at the transmission as we were worried there was a leak.  Sure enough, the transmission is leaking and now it will be in the shop for a week while they order a new one and replace it on this two month old car.  I am glad I did not get stranded on a remote road we often travel on with no cell phone access. The dealer insisted the windshield crack is not a design defect but was caused by something unrelated, so we are stuck with fixing that on our own dime. Acura service claims the intermittent  CarPlay problems are due to it having two USB ports and only 1 should be used for CarPlay (makes no sense, as we always use the one the dealer told us to use, in the console, and CarPlay usually works off it).But it is a ""non-issue"" in their mind despite many people on forums complaining about its unreliability.    What was supposed to be a reliable new car with safety upgrades has turned into a potentially  unsafe, smoking (but pretty and fun) car which could have started a fire, and  with both Acura Nav and CarPlay so unreliable I would have to unplug  my phone and navigate off of it directly by looking at the screen to do what I want, which is illegal and unsafe.  I am glad I did not trade in my old Lexus, as that is what I am driving now, anticipating more headaches to come on getting the Acura fixed and wondering ""what next?"". The good is that it is beautiful, has wonderful handling and acceleration (my favorite is Sport Mode), decent seats, and cargo space as large as the Lexus.  The paddle shifters are great fun. It has nice speakers, and when CarPlay works, it is fun calling up all kinds of music I do not own using the optional Apple music subscription. The ACC works well, has 4 different following distance settings and will reliably start and stop the car on freeway and in traffic, I have carefully tested
 it, has not failed a single time .  The fit and finish are good except for sharp edges on the upper windows when I touch them to close the doors (and of course, unless the front glass has a design defect, e.g, if that is why it is already cracked).  The center console which doubles as an arm rest is not as big or ergonomically friendly as on the Lexus.  The driver blind spot is worse, even when I turn my head, so I really have to check the flashing blind spot light before changing lanes ( I do not trust it yet). The lane drift protection does not do much, just flashes a dim light you have to be looking at to notice, does not move me back to my lane. I expected better collision protection features.  All in, a disappointing purchase for this price and I now worry about taking it on long trips.

acura,rdx,2019,Sonia Petriello, 08/17/2018,Regretting my decision on RDX 2019,neu,"I wanted to love this car, my boyfriend has been leasing Acura's for over 10 years and loves his TLX and has been harping me to get into an Acura.  Up until this year I thought the RDX was ugly and since they just revamped everything I decided to get the  2019 RDX.  I wanted the A-spec but the dealer made it very un-affordable for me so I went with the base model since I can use the Apple Play.  I feel there is way too much going on with the technology, so many times I felt like my eyes were not on the road because I was trying to navigate the system and the mouse pad is annoying.  The Auto Idle button is a nuisance and I wish the back-up camera beeped when you are coming close to an object.  All my other leases of different makes always had this, Acura is lacking with certain things.  I also miss having Power Fold mirrors which was on my Kia and Acura it's a manual process, so now when I pull into my tight driveway, I have to manually pull in driver-side mirror and hope I don't hit the passenger side mirror because I'm not leaning across the car to pull that one in!!!   I finally started getting the hang of it and my third week in the home screen freezes and does not turn off draining off the battery.  I bought it back to the dealer, they had the car for 6 days and couldn't replicate the issue, so they did a hard reset and told me they HOPE that fixes the problem.  HOPE now has me wondering when and if this is going to happen again and where will I be when it does happen, as if it does happen it needs to get into the dealer immediately because I'll have a dead battery otherwise.  I am very disappointed and maybe should have waited longer to read other people's reviews before I made this decision.  I can only pray that I will not have additional issues with this vehicle over the next three years since I only had it for a month and already had issues.  I am hoping that all this goes away over my leasing term otherwise I will not be returning to Acura. I also forgot to add there is no CD player in this truck either, another con.

acura,rdx,2019,Mspenc45, 02/22/2019,No remorse!,pos,"REading reviews on the RDX prior to purchase had me concerned, especially about the technology systems. I cannot discount the bad experiences of other owners, but have nothing but praise for ours. My wife has decided it is now her car instead of mine, and suggested buying a second one. Is it perfect no, but close enough. Only dislikes are the seat design makes them pretty stiff on the bottom panels. Essentially the leather has to stretch to allow for any conformity to your bottom side, not a huge deal. No Android auto yet, but I personally do not like Android Auto and turn it off in my GT350. The RDX Advanced is just an all around pleasure to drive, the lane keep assist an adaptive cruise control are better than any other brand we've tried. If I had a wish list, I think they should have included the remote key fob start, and some changes in the stitching for the seat bottoms.  We are getting right at 25mpg average.

acura,rdx,2019,Miwuk kid, 07/01/2019,"Almost hit a home run, but instead flied out",neu,"This is our 6th Acura. We have had the 1st and 2nd generation RDX’s, 2012 and 2015 versions. We also are currently driving a 2016 MDX. The new RDX is by far the best one (of the past RDX’s) from a design and look perspective. We had a 2015 Audi Q5 and the RDX compares nicely to the Audi in fit and finish, but the 2018 Audi Q5 which I’ve been in is a much smoother car. 
My driving experience is pretty good as long as I don’t use Apple Car Play. The ride is smooth and comfortable. I do notice some transmission hiccups as the car warms up and ascends a small hill. I don’t notice any other problems once the car is warmed up. I have owned the car for 8 months and have had many problems with the technology. After purchasing the car, we were driving home from the dealership (120 miles away) and the audio system shut down and there was no sound the rest of the way home. That happened at least 3 more times. One day I came home and the screen would not turn off. After 30 minutes I called the dealership and they wanted me to drive it in. Another 120 miles, get a loaner and return the next day, that is 8 hours of driving and almost 500 miles. I decided to disconnect the battery and that fixed the problem and it never happened again. There were a lot of problems here and there with the entertainment system but almost all got fixed with the last update. 
However, the Acura software engineers really messed up the Apple Car Play interface. I had a Honda CRV with CarPlay for 18 months and have driven a Kia Soul for 2 weeks and had virtually no problems with them. In the RDX it fails every time I am in the car and using it. It will start distorting the sound and then shuts down. It takes around 5 minutes for it come back. I switch over to Bluetooth and use it to listen to navigation and music. But when CarPlay resets it automatically turns off the Bluetooth and starts playing again which is a problem because if I am in the car long enough it will do it again. 
Which brings me to the real issue with the car. In the 8 months that I have driven the car I have only put 2,600 miles on it. My wife and I don’t want the aggravation of dealing with the weird problems with the audio. If we are going to town, we will drive the car, but any trip of more than 5 miles we will not drive it. We have no confidence in the car and Acura to fix it. It is a major issue with the car and there are numerous complaints about it on all the forums but it is beyond their capability to fix. 
I almost bought a BMW X3 and would have because the dealership is 4 miles from my house, but they wouldn’t sell the car for a fair price. I was hesitant about buying the RDX because it was a major departure from the previous versions. I did and now regret it.  Since I bought my car the BMW dealership has had 2 almost brand new RDX’s on their lot because of them getting traded in. It makes we wonder when I will make it a 3rd one. 
After 15 months of ownership there have been no fixes to the problems. At the shop in Tennessee while getting the MDX fixed I was talking to the head of service about Acura fixing the problem and he said they were trying to fix it. I was alone, 2 other customers were trying to find out the same thing.

acura,rdx,2019,NJMcky, 12/22/2018,2019 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech,pos,"Just bought this week my new 2019 Acura RDX Tech SH-AWD, Silver Ext, Expresso int.  Did a trade in of my 2010 Acura RDX SH-AWD Tech. So you can consider a like to like trade in. Have below comments on the new car - 1.) For person switching from auto stick transmission to electronic button transmission is a big change. While doing K turn was used to doing it quicker with stick shift. But with button you will need to come to a complete stop of vehicle before switching the button to drive. Bit of a hassle while doing city driving like NYC. b) While driving on highway and stepping up on gas, i can hear the noise ""vroom vroom"".. makes me feel as though I am driving a german car.  c) Brake sometimes had to push hard for vehicle to stop. Not sure if this is due to low brakes or some issue with brake.. Will drive some more before taking to dealer. d) Car engine stops in traffic light if the ""A"" button is not engaged. Got to get used to this to ensure engine doesn't stop while on a traffic light. Bit annoying if you forget to have this button engaged. e) Car has auto headlight on by default. This is annoying sometimes in city driving as head light gets on when no traffic is in front, but for a sec the opposite driver will see high beam and curse me for having it on city driving. Will need to figure how to switch this off.

More update - Acura has really screwed the GPS in new car. Earlier my home address route it used to pick up from my usual destination but now gps is lost and keep searching. I liked my 2010 Acura RDX gps. It was much faster and accurate. 2) Still feel low brakes and will need hard braking sometimes to stop the car. Feel brakes are not very sensitive and need to be slammed sometimes to stop the car. 3) in city driving getting 15 mpg not 20 as advertised. Will go long drive this weekend and check on hghway mileage.

acura,rdx,2019,Happy Acura Owner, 10/04/2018,LOVE THIS CAR!,pos,"I love, love, love this car!!  My last car was a BMW X5, and when it was time to replace it I thought for sure I was going go with a BMW sedan.  But then I discovered I didn't like sedans anymore.   I test drove several smaller SUVs - including the BMW X3 (blah), AudiQ5 (too plain) and Volvo XC60 (seats were uncomfortable weird touchscreen system).  The Acura RDX was amazing the first time I drove it and it still is!   I have had no problems with the Nav system, and I love how Apple CarPlay works so well.  It's a peppy fast car and makes me happy!"
acura,rdx,2019,Steve, 09/27/2018,Acceleration issues,neg,"The RDX on its surface is a great vehicle. I have problems with getting the vehicle to respond to throttle inputs in traffic which creates a safety issue. Many times the car will not accelerate, taking between 1-3 seconds before responding to throttle inputs. This happens regardless of the driving or transmission mode. The factory has been poor to respond on the issue and I feel this could lead to accidents. Meeting with an Acura factory representative ended with being told the vehicle is responding as designed and they suggested I shift it manually. So if you like your vehicle to respond quickly when you hit the accelerator, this may not be the best car for you. Audi Q5 responds much more naturally.

After a year I feel mostly the same way. I have added a PRL intercooler and flashed the ECU with Hondata software. These two things dramatically improve the responsiveness and somewhat remove the laggy throttle. It’s better but not gone. Power is better overall as well. Vehicle still seems like shift logic is confused regularly.

acura,rdx,2019,Buck Thorn, 12/07/2018,This is the fourth RDX I have leased.,pos,"The 2019 model is an improvement over the previous models in terms of handling and comfort. The entertainment and information system is not user friendly. I have had the car for three months and I am just getting accustomed to the system but it still has drawbacks , especially trying to use it while driving. My frustration with the electronics have almost overshadowed the fact that this is a very good vehicle in all other respects. My wife just leased a new Subaru, and the information system is much friendlier. Additionally the local Subaru dealers offer a trainer who will reach out to help you with the vehicle. The RDX is a better fit for my driving, but the Acura dealers can't match the local Subaru dealers in customer support

acura,rdx,2019,Al, 07/31/2018,Vehicle Wrapped Around a Computer Center - Update2,pos,"We've owned this vehicle for 18 months now and have put about 11k miles on it.  While other reviewers have had significant quality/reliability issues, we have not had any issues whatsoever.  My wife LOVES this car.  It's pretty.  Very responsive.  We live in a hilly, snowy area and the handling is wonderful.  Our gas mileage falls right in line with the advertised - averaging about 23 mpg combined.  Note that when the turbos kick in the acceleration is awesome, but you certainly won't get the expected mpg - more like 17 to 19.  So if you want the thrill, you will pay for it.   The navigation system is virtually unusable.  You can't name the stored addresses.  We don't use Bluetooth or Apple play.  The maintenance minder not only tells you when tire pressure is low, it provides the pressure in individual tires.  The sound system is great.  Compared to the competition, it's about $10k cheaper for the same features.  Put a Garmin on your dash and relax.

acura,rdx,2019,Manny P, 08/28/2018,The 2019 RDX Brought Me Back,pos,"Had owned a 2016 RDX and was pleased, so I was excited with the 2019 redesign -- now am extremely pleased having purchased it. Very comfortable, smooth ride and a lot of great features for the price. Got the tech package as I have never been good with estimating the distance between me and other cars when parking. The sensors are amazing and I'm finding I have more space around me then I had thought. One feature I'm hoping they address, is the navigation is fixed at a certain ""view."" If you zoom back on the map, it does not track as you drive. A minor quibble. The sound system is beyond amazing, and very glad I made it back to Acura.
"
acura,rdx,2019,frank h., 03/15/2019,RDX 2016 had better features that were removed,neu,"Infotainment system hard to use. In 2016 navi system you could save identifier with favorite. In 2019 only address can be saved. 2016 beeped when lane departure activated, not 2019. Just had an infotainment system update in the hopes that a bug I had would be fixed, but it wasn't. When trying to use voice command sometimes it works, then I get Voice System initializing and the voice system freezes until the car is turned off and restarted. No easy way to report this glitch to Acura. Dealer and customer relations certainly not briefed sufficiently in the new info system. Car drives well, gas mileage leaves a little to be desired. Comfort is great.
"
acura,rdx,2019,sadrdxowner, 07/23/2019,Transmission failure,neg,"With only a few thousand miles, the transmission simply died. The car wouldn't start because of the transmission error, I couldn't even get it to turn on Accessory mode. The Acura technicians were not able to get it into neutral to load it onto a flatbed tow truck. Acura still has the car (it's been over 2 weeks) and they installed a new transmission just a few days into having it. Why are they still working on it? I was told that they basically have not been able to get the new transmission to work correctly. If you read enough reviews, you will see that the RDX is having  issues with transmissions among other things. I have been a loyal Honda/Acura customer for 15 years (this was our 8th, but first Acura) and I'm not getting much of a response from Acura. I bought this for Acura's history of reliability, but clearly something has changed. How Acura responds to these problems will be a tell-tale sign of their commitment to customers going forward.
"
acura,rdx,2019,My Last Acura, 08/29/2019,Technology destroys driving experience,neg,"Like many other reviewers, I've had trouble with the infotainment system since taking delivery in August, 2018.  I've installed all upgrades and spoken to Acura customer service and the dealers who were not helpful at all.  My problems include:

- Extreme latency.  Frequent system boot times of 2 minutes or greater, failure to load SiriusXM regularly, unresponsive trackpad.  Maddening to use.

- Bluetooth buzzing.  This is not related to interference while driving.  If I'm talking on the phone, enter the car and the handset hands off to bluetooth, I get intermittent buzzing.

- Transmission fails to upshift when traveling downhill in certain situations, causing the tachometer to ""redline""

- Auto high beams activate even when this feature has been deactivated

- Auto idle shutoff is maddening, even though you can disable it (not permanently, there is a button you can push each time you start the car).

This is my fifth and last Acura.  Had I known I would have these problems I never would have bought this car.  I generally don't write reviews, this car is so bad I wrote this one.

acura,rdx,2019,John, 12/23/2018,Almost got T-Boned because of faulty transmission,neg,"Looks like I am not the only one with this problem. The 2019 RDX I just bought will sporadically downshift while am accelerating causing the car to jerk back and forth. I’ve taken it to the dealer 4 times and they can’t find anything wrong with it. I’ve shown them videos (I managed to capture it while fearing for my life) and they agree there is a problem, but can’t find it. The best they can do is wash the car for me. The general manger suggested I file a lemon law claim. Zero help with a car that almost got me into a car accident.
"
acura,rdx,2019,Greg Ormerod, 10/07/2018,A Good Car for the Money,pos,"I had a 2012 Infiniti EX35 and had planned to buy the 2019 Infiniti QX50 but became concerned about its quirky CVT transmission, throttle issues, and outdated infotainment system. Therefore, I bought the 2019 RDX with the Advance package three months ago and so far it has been great. I like the way the doors close with a solid thunk. The build quality is solid and the design is sporty. I like that this design is all its own instead of an upscale CRV. The seating is comfortable - especially with the 16-way adjustable seating. I have read some complaints about the complexity of the infotainment system touch pad and the push-button transmission controls . Consumer Reports is especially harsh on both categories. However, I have found that both are quite easy to use. The infotainment touch pad functionality is based on cell phones and tablets. If you need a menu option that is out of view to the right, then you swipe to the left to bring it into view and then select it. If you need a menu option that is out of view to the bottom, then you swipe up to bring it into view. Once you get used to this principle, it is easy to use. It's display screen is mounted high so it's within your field of vision when watching the road. The push button transmission controls also require some adjustment time, but are logical and easy to use. There is a definite difference between Comfort and Sport modes. Acceleration is better in Sport, but the ride becomes more stiff and the steering wheel tightens up - as would be expected. Therefore, I use Sport mode when driving highways during my weekly commute and then dial it back to Comfort mode for local driving during the weekends. The gas mileage average has been as high as 26 MPG during highway driving but can drop down to the 22 MPG range after extensive local driving. It won't ride quite as nice as its German counterparts, but it feels solid and stable on the road, and its price is much better. In fact, for the amount of features and technology this car includes, and for the way it performs and handles, its a great car for the money.
Update (10/2020): I have now had the car for over two years and have had no issues with it.

acura,rdx,2019,RichardG, 11/24/2018,Fun to Drive,pos,"I have put about 8,400 miles on my SH-AWD Advance. I love the performance. It's really fun to drive ( I like the quick shifts from the 10 speed when I accelerate hard). The 3D stereo is great. I actually learned to use the True Touchpad Interface in a couple of days. The USB port for playing my iPod has been troublesome. It will just lock up and stop playing. I use the Bluetooth method for my iPod but it doesn't have the features available with the USB. I also really like the storage options in the rear. I use the underfloor storage quite a bit. The car has performed very well since I purchased it. I enjoy it's performance on the highway. I can enter the freeway confidently without concern I might get run over by someone doing 80 mph. The only dislike I have is the Idle Stop. I don't care for this feature but it can be disabled. It must be disabled every time you start the car.

acura,rdx,2019,James, 01/25/2019,Squeaky shocks over bumps,neu,"About a week after i got this car, i went over a speed bump and heard a squeak on the driver's side. Sounded like an old SUV that needed new shocks. I thought it was not a big deal and needed the car to break in. but its been two months and i was able to catch it on video. The dealer now uses my video as an example since more of the same car have com in with the exact same problem. I love the car and was very excited for it. Its in the shop as we speak, but a 2 month old car should 0 issues with it. Hopefully this gets fixed because this will be the third time going back and it's becoming annoying.

acura,rdx,2019,Andres, 01/30/2019,5 different problems in 2 months!!,neg,"Shocks made noise a week after I pulled it off the lot. Left control arm was faulty. Then the passenger one went.  Only got one changed. The breaks squeak, they “fixed” it, still squeaking. Then my center console wouldn’t work AT ALL. To top it off, now my car won’t even start. Love the car but I’m done with it.

acura,rdx,2019,Alan Bernard, 08/22/2018,Nav is a deal breaker,pos,"I was about to pull the trigger and order the RDX SH-AWD Advanced. It has everything I'm looking for at a very competitive price. Unfortunately, I use my $150 Garmin- on -a-suction-cup Navigation a great deal and there are two important things it will do that the RDX's nav won't. First, there is no way to give a stored addresses a name. so if you have thirty addresses stored you have to remember which is the doctor, which is the dentist, and which is the Acura Dealer. That is unsatisfactory. I'm told prior years RDX's could store by name. Secondly there is no way to store your current location and give it a name. So if I'm driving through the mountains and stumble across a fish pond, I can't store my current location and name it ""Hidden lake"" I guess I'm off to the Volvo dealer to see if the XC-60 can do any better. Rats!"
acura,rdx,2019,Stacy, 10/23/2018,2019 RDX-Love It!!,pos,"I just bought this two days ago.  I love it so far.  I traded in 2015 RDX with Tech package and got the Advance Package.  It has almost as many features as my husbands Mercedes Benz E class but cost about 25k less.  It is a huge upgrade over my 2015.  The interior really feels like a luxury car.  There are a couple of things I don’t love.  The idle/stop feature has to be turned off every time you start the vehicle.  Idle/stop does not activate in the Sport plus mode, which is nice.  I also don’t like the feel of the brakes. I feel like I have to push the pedal all the way to the floor before it engages. I love the redesigned cargo area.  It seems so much bigger.

acura,rdx,2019,john middelkamp, 11/30/2018,What more can you want?,pos,"We actually need an SUV to haul things back and forth to our lake house.  We previously owned 2 MDXs but decided, since we never used the 3rd row of seats that a smaller SUV would suffice.  It has.  We have owned the 2019 since the end of June.  I had shopped a number of other makes actually thinking that I wanted a German car.  The Audi was the highest contender but my two criteria were seats that cooled and blind spot alerts.  To get that on the Audi I had to go to their deluxe model which was fine except it only came with a black interior which my wife really didn't want.  There were other things but in the end, unless I wanted to go to an 80,000 Porsche,  this car had everything I wanted, and more, at 10,000 less.  I have never had a problem with my two previous Acuras.  My complaints are really minor:  garage door opener is small, side view mirrors don't fold in when car is turned off, navigation image screen could be sharper.  I have friends who just got a new Mercedes and a new BMW.  Both of them think I made the best purchase.

acura,rdx,2019,joe boy, 08/03/2018,great acceleration,pos,"luxurious SUV. comfortable. 5 modes of transmission allow everything from snow to sport+.  the latter has firm handling, terrific pickup.  overall fuel economy is not as good as prior model. navigating touch system for infotainment is not completely intuitive.  seats are superb and finish is first rate.  style is up to date and quite elegant.

acura,rdx,2019,BENOIT, 09/26/2018,Macura,pos,"Powertrain is extremely powerful, i drove all the Acura line up, the only vehicles that feel faster than the RDX is the NSX which is a sport car. The 10 speeds transmission is flawless compare to the Lexus RX 350 8speeds is horrible and the  zf  9 speeds on the MDX & TLX is scary. Great MPG., comfortable ,fast and the fake exhaust sound is  great. I drove subsequently , RX350, NX, RDX and the BMW x3 my choice was easy , I bought the A spec SH-AWD.

acura,rdx,2019,Trevor Clark, 12/05/2018,No Regrets,pos,"Cross shopped with X3, Q5, GLC300. Acura has the best value proposition. The overall package is excellent but I HATE the touch pad thing. It is impossible for me to use while driving as my hand bounces all over the place and wrist pad is in the wrong place for stabilization. I love the power, the easy parking/maneuverability, the ELS Audio, and the heads up display. I’ve owned it about a year and a half so I’m out of the honeymoon period, and I would make the same choice again. "
acura,rdx,2019,Bill in Pittsburgh, 05/22/2019,"""X"" This from your vehicle choices",neg,"I purchased the RDX over other vehicle lines (BMW, Mercedes, Lexus, Infinity) after extensive research.  The final determinant for me was the perceived quality which Honda builds into its vehicles.  I have a CRV, and I traded in a BMW. I have owned a number of cars over the years both foreign and domestic, and the CRV by far was the best in terms of reliability and cost of maintenance.  Much to my chagrin, the Acura RDX does not live up to the same standard.  With a bit over 1000 miles on the vehicle, I have had two instances where I have lost my radio and/or GPS function.  This after one stint in the service department already.  Definitely not what I expected from Honda, or from a vehicle which is not inexpensive by any means.  "

Nothing but infotainment connectivity headaches, screen blackouts, CarPlay unavailability, and transmission issue at 2,000 miles. The ride and new styling are great, but hassles with infotainment issues, upgrades, and six trips (one was flat-bed tow in) within first 10 months is ridiculous. Presently am considering other car options. To those who have not experienced/or poo-pooed the infotainment issues, consider yourselves lucky!

acura,rdx,2019,Aggravated Beyond Belief, 09/13/2019,Love Hate - Glad I leased,neu,"When I first got this car I was in love. I loved how plush the seats were and how the suspension just soaked up the bumps. I envisioned myself on long road trips but instead I can barely stand to be in the car for anything other than a quick commute. 
I’ll start by saying that I love the idea of all the technology that is in the car and for me the touch pad is not that big of a deal. However, I frequently have to take my eyes off the road to make sure I am selecting the correct options on the screen and from my experience this can lead to dangerous situations. Forget about using voice command. It is often too slow to respond, doesn’t respond or gets the options wrong.
Love... love... love the ELS studio 3D audio system. This system truly does sound amazing.  What I discovered though is that it only sounds great from a digital source such as satellite radio. Listening to the regular radio sounds just like any other crappy radio.
Was never really able to get the navigation system to work correctly. Apple car play is inconsistent and now as a rule if I need to navigate anywhere I will just use the maps app direct from my phone. Also, at start up it will take the radio a long time to boot up. Sometimes I will arrive at my destination before the system loads. Dealership has tried updates but they never work.
Now the really frustrating part of this car and why I’m so glad I leased. The transmission... from a stop it feels like the car is in 2nd or 3rd gear. It’s so sluggish going getting off the line. I absolutely hate it. The breaks squeal and it has been to the dealership multiple times for this. Dealership finally said that it’s now a known issue and currently no fix. They even told me that changing the break rotors won’t help.  Finally, the reason why I’m so glad I leased. I would have overlooked every other short coming of this car but this next issue is just driving me over the edge. From day one there has been a rattle coming from the the passenger side head liner near the speaker that is directly over the passengers head. This rattle drives me and the passenger nuts. The car has been in the shop several times. Each time there has been no clear fix. Now, an additional rattle has started coming from the headliner where the controls for the sunroof are. May seem minor but it’s a huge distraction. Back to the dealership we go. :(

Changing stations with a voice command takes 3-4 minutes. The command is immediately acknowledged,  but it will continue playing the same station 
Can't change volume or station for 2-3 minutes after startup 
Navigation directions on Heads up display don't match main screen or voice directions. Heads up shows last turn, not next turn

acura,rdx,2019,Adrian Pineda, 06/20/2018,Very Good!,pos,"I test drove the new RDX today. It had the AWD/Tech package (only because they didn't have the ASpec or Advance in AWD available. Pros: SEATS! The seats are super confortable (seating position and visibility are great). Most materials are top quality. It drives nice and smooth and the 2.0 Turbo really moves the car. The touchpad is easy to use; I don't understand experts who ding it for its complexity. Cons: wheel choices not great, some materials feel not as upscale  (e.g. the steering wheel and other panels not covered with leather) The a/c display seems outdated. Over all, a very good contender that has its price as one of its strong points against the competition. Acura reliability in my experience will draw customers that don't trust BMW's after initial warranty. I'm still test driving the BMW X3 and the Audi Q5.
