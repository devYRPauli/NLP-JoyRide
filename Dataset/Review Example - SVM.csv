acura,ilx,2013,mahowald, 08/12/2012,Getting 43 Mpg on daily commute,pos,"I love this car.
Gas mileage, suspension, and stereo are great.
Bluetooth integration and Pandora integration work perfectly. Suspension and noise cancellation work amazingly well.
Although it looks small, it has plenty of room and has always been big enough. 
Gas mileage has been from 42 to 45 without really trying."
acura,ilx,2013,VIP, 07/26/2016,New to me ILX,pos,"I purchased my 2013 ILX from the dealer used with 30k miles in 2016. So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.

acura,ilx,2013,bybchucky, 09/14/2013,Excellet Commuter Car,pos,"I recently purchased a 2013 ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."
acura,ilx,2013,bayareamom, 01/26/2015,Peppy Hybrid that Turns Heads,pos,"We bought our ILX used and have been incredibly pleased with it thus far.  As a former Prius owner, I feel much cooler driving this sporty Acura, although I do miss the 50+ mpg of the Prius.  It's fun to drive, handles well, stops on a dime, and has all of the modern features you'd expect from an Acura.  I primarily drive around town (about 90% of the time) with lots of stopping and am averaging about 37-38 mpg.  I love the simplicity of the interior, which is easy to use and not as bright or busy as some of the other models we looked at.  I hope this awesome car continues to fly under the radar so I'll continue to be one of the only ones on the road driving it!  "
acura,ilx,2013,Kerry Olson, 03/26/2016,2013 Acura ILX Hybrid w/ Tech Package,pos,"In April of 2015 we were in need of another car. Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.

acura,ilx,2013,boudouris_3, 06/19/2012,"Surely NOT just a ""glorified Civic""",pos,"Just upgraded from my 5-spd Saab 9-3 sedan to a brand new Acura ilx w/premium package and the 2.4L 6-spd engine.
The premium package comes with nearly everything that you could ask for minus navigation.

Very nice engine note that gives the car some personality without sounding like a cheap tuner.
The only knock I could say about the ilx is the interior space which is expected to be small due to the price point and market that Acura intends to target.

If you're in your 20s or early 30s and are looking for something fun to drive without sacrificing the luxury amenities, look no further than the ilx.

Oh and by the way, I'm getting 35-40 highway mpg."
acura,ilx,2013,geiim, 01/29/2013,An Excellent Car!,pos,"I have had my ILX now for over a month and 1,500 miles. It is an excellent car. The complaints about the 2.0L engine being slow are not accurate. I find it to be very peppy and responsive. Plus I drive 64 miles back and forth from work 5 days a week and I have never gotten less than 30 MPG, with an average of 29 MPG city/hwy driving overall. The interior is of excellent quality and the ride is smooth and quiet. The electronics are excellent and the sound system is very good, I use the XM radio all the time and it never drops out. I'm 6 ft tall, 250 lbs and I fit very comfortably in the car. I've even ridden in the back seat and that was comfortable. It looks great and rides great! "
acura,ilx,2013,Brittany, 05/19/2019,Owned for 6 yeasr,pos,"Have not had trouble with maintenance in over 6 years.  I've only had the oil and tires changed. It has never broke down on me. I highly recommend it!. I'm currently at 94,000 miles and get around 32-36mpg total. Full gas tank holds around 11 gallons. I'm still happy with my purchase with no regrets. I got the 2013 model and purchased it pre-owned that same year in May 2013 with 3000 miles on it.
"
acura,ilx,2013,Banjo, 10/25/2016,Pleasantly Surprised!,pos,"My previous car was a leased 2015 Civic EX-L, but due to a job change I needed to get out of my lease mileage restrictions. I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price.

acura,ilx,2013,hleong, 07/27/2012,Driving this car to work everyday....,pos,"This is the second month I am driving this car to work, everyday for 70 miles. 

Certainly don't feel like driving a Civic. Indeed, I owned a 2 doors Accord for 9 years and ILX is way more luxury than Accord, hence I don't know why people said it is just an upscale Civic?! Drive before you judge.... 

Compare to Lexus CT200h and CT200h is not even close to ILX, in luxury and design. ILX designers/engineers are really serious in doing the job and they do it very well. "
acura,ilx,2013,central25thst, 07/23/2012,Go fast with looks,pos,Grown up with a 6 speed. Smooth shifting tranny. Soft touches allover. Smart phone integration is incredible. 
acura,ilx,2013,sethwas, 04/22/2013,best deal in town if you do your homework,pos,"How to sum this car up - there are no other vehicles in this size that have this many features at this price.
That could be good or bad. 
There are larger vehicles that have this many features at this price (with no gas mileage penalty) and there are plenty of vehicles that are this size that are less expensive and have less features.
So if you could lease a Civic EX-L or a premium package ILX (same monthly payment after you factor in gas and insurance) which would you choose?
If you could buy a loaded Accord or Mazda6 for the same price which would you choose?
Does the badge or dealer experience matter?
All are amazing vehicles - you just need to decide where you want to be."
acura,ilx,2013,hondafan30, 09/08/2012,Acura ILX Impressions after first month,pos,"The Ilx is a great car. I am a Honda/Acura fan which is a big part of why I purchased this car.
You can get more car for the money with Toyota, Honda or Nissan any day, but if you want the Acura badge and build quality you pay the premium. The car handles extremely well, road noise is pretty low and the interior is one of the most comfortable and aesthetically appealing of any car I have owned. The interior isn't large but its done very well. I really enjoy driving this car and it gets its fair share of looks. Don't judge this car by pictures, I went to the dealer to buy a tsx and left with this because when I saw it the body styling really hooked me in. It is definitely not a rebadged civic"
acura,ilx,2013,jeepcolorado, 09/16/2012,Happy with my Acura ILX after 4000 miles,pos,"I purchased the Acura ILX after owning a Jeep Grand Cherokee for seven years.
I really wanted a new JGC Overland, but decided it made more economic sense to look for a comfortable 60 miles/day commuter that would still give the feeling I was driving a solid entry level luxury car with most of todays tech features.

The ILX has a very well engineered interior that seems well above the luxury level of a Civic or other lower end cars and in line with most other cars up to about 40K.
It is a very pleasant place to relax while commuting a couple of hours a day.

With a low 30's budget I compared against the Audi A3, VW GTI, Lexus 250H, and Suburu Outback and decided this was the best choice."
acura,ilx,2013,stevenrose, 11/11/2012,So excited to buy my new Acura ILX,pos,"I have owned many cars from Jeeps to Volvos and I keep coming back to Honda products.
I owned a 1996 Acura Integra and I always refer to that as my favorite car.
I owned a 2007 Volvo S40 that was pretty to look at, but drove very choppy.
The 2013 Acura ILX is really smooth and fun to drive.
I have read reviews that the ILX car is a Honda Civic in a tuxedo.
What is wrong with a Honda Civic?
My 2006 Honda Civic EX Coupe drove 10 times better than my Volvo S40 and the new ILX I just purchased drives even smoother and is 10x more luxurious than my Honda was.

I think I have found that perfect blend of performance, luxury and style.
I think I might have found my new favorite car."
acura,ilx,2013,ilx2013je, 01/21/2013,Polished metal metallic/Parchment Premium Pkg.,pos,"3 months of ownership and I'm extremely satisfied with my new ILX.
Very peppy for a small 4cyl. engine. Ride and handling are very impressive.
Excellent use of space on the interior.
I'm coming from a mid-size and don't miss the little extra room I previously had.
I don't want to see many of them on the road, but everyone should give this car a try."
acura,ilx,2013,ajwhitesox, 05/31/2012,Very satisfied,pos,"Just purchased this car brand new... black on black tech package.
 Love all the tech features!
Nav, weather, bluetooth audio, backup camera....

Average gas mileage combined is 30 thus far.
VERY quiet on the road.
 I really like the way the car looks and the keyless entry on the door handle makes life easy.
 LOVE IT!

acura,ilx,2013,ILX driver, 08/23/2017,Feels like a Civic with luxury price tag.,neg,"I helped m Grandma buy a CPO 2013 ILX w/ Tech. package.  She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 ""luxury"" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic.

acura,ilx,2013,ohmygoshitsme, 06/22/2012,IN LOVE WITH THIS CAR!! ITS A HEAD TURNER!,pos,"My dad and I spent months trying to find the perfect car to me.
When I finally sat in this one at the dealership, things just clicked and I knew that this was the one. I love the sleek, exterior design, and the interior has really nice, soft leather. Now I'll never get lost thanks to my navigation, and lovely backup camera!!! I just wish this car had blind spot monitors and had memory seating feature, so I wouldn't have to adjust it everytime someone sits in my car! Also, I don't like how the front and wheel interior is black and the rest of my car is beige! But otherwise, amazing performance and a real money saver when it comes
to gas. Couldn't be happier with it! Love my birthday present"
acura,ilx,2013,Austin C, 12/16/2018,"Fun Drive, Slow Ride",pos,"If you live in a city where traffic and drivers all appear to have an emergency, be prepared to drive like your part of a funeral procession. This car has one gear that has umph...3rd. Every other gear is designed to keep you from the gas pump and they do. The ILX handles incredible well, takes corners with ease and brakes suddenly when needed. Keep your stereo loud, as you want to drown out the road noise. The interior is sharply designed , but does so with less than stellar Lego material. Looks great, just don't touch anything...kills the illusion. I have never experienced any mechanical failure...not one. I still have great braking left after 67,000 miles. I keep taking my car in, thinking the mechanics who inspect my car, forget to check the brakes. The cars design is fantastic. When another car passes me, as they usually do, they stare at the car or is it me, for moving too slow? Overall, I would buy this again without hesitation. No car has made me laugh so hard with the look of speed and the resiliency to keep me pleased. I do really like this car...just please put the rest of the gears in next time.

acura,ilx,2013,Saleen8928, 09/06/2019,Best car you’ll find in this class!,pos,"This car is comfortable, and feels roomier than its small size would lead you to believe.  The navigation system is easy to use and the screen is clear and large.  The upgraded sound system is better than I would expect in this class of car.  There are a few minor drawbacks to the car, but based on the price point, you have to expect some trade offs.  First, the 150hp engine is sufficient for 80% of situations, but it’s definitely underpowered.  Get the optional 200hp engine if you can (I think in newer models they made it standard).  I have driven a 2018 with the 200hp, and it makes a huge difference.  Second, there are no memory seat buttons.  I didn’t think this would be a big deal when I was car shopping, but I realized quickly that I used memory seats way more often than I thought.  Then again, I’m someone who is overly sensitive to a seat position that’s slightly off from what I’m used to!   It would be nice if they made this model in AWD, but snow traction is about as decent as you can find without all wheel drive.
"
acura,ilx,2013,Alison, 11/13/2020,Awesome little car!,pos,"I love my ILX Hybrid.  Extremely reliable, Great ride and Great gas mileage (more than advertised even when driving in sport mode).  No mechanical failure and I’m up to 97k miles.  Love the Dolby surround sound!  Just overall a great car and joy to own!
"
acura,ilx,2014,stevenrose, 10/29/2013,Great performance and great value,pos,"Hi-I still love my Acura ILX, the highlight of the car is the responsive engine and transmission.  I also think the care is very attractive and I love the way the steering wheel leather feels.  I also think the steering is also very responsive, even thought it is light.  The only downfall to the car is road noise , however I changed the tires and it made a huge difference.  I did research on Tire rack and purchased tires with the highest rating and I am very impressed.  I am not sure why Acura puts the Michelin Pilot mmx4 on the car when they are not rated well for noise.



I have to say my new ILX is a great car.
The engine is really responsive and the shifting is really smooth.
The interior is finished very well and the leather wrapped steering wheel feels great on the hands.

Handling is excellent, the car goes exactly where you point it.
After the car is broken in, the car is really sporty to drive.
I think the car is underrated.
Consumer Reports does a great job recommending the ILX, other reviewers complain that the ILX is underpowered, but I would give it a test drive.
I drove the new Accord and the Subaru Legacy and I liked the ILX a lot better.
I like how compact and zippy it feels.

I am an Acura Fan and in love with the ILX

acura,ilx,2014,aeroj101, 06/23/2014,I absolutely love this car!!! Best car purchase I have made.,pos,"I bought the manual 2.4 version about a month ago, and I am completely in love with this car. First, I think I am probably the target consumer (young professional at a corporate job). I wouldn't want a Civic Si, but I definitely wanted a manual transmission (and the MT option is the ONE main reason I chose the ILX over a Lexus IS; I don't care if the IS is faster, I wanted an MT). The sound isolation is good, road comfort is great (I'm not trying to experience all the bumps on the road), and I personally love hearing the tune of engine revving up (it's beautiful, and it's a manual, and that's part of the fun). I am committed to only owning MT cars, and am glad Acura makes a few."
acura,ilx,2014,david_d82, 07/16/2014,Great Alternative to Boring Commuter Cars!,pos,"I bought my 2014 ILX 2.4 a little over a month ago, and it's been a great purchase.
I did a LOT of research before purchasing this car, and I am very happy that I was not scared off by some of the reviews from the automotive journalism industry.


First, this car is not a rebadged Civic Si. different dimensions, different suspension setup and hardware. Also no garish wing or ugly red interior inserts like the Si. Yay!
Great manual transmission, too. clutch pickup is spot-on, and shifts are super smooth. nice enough features for the price, but infotainment screen is kinda chintzy, and rear seat passengers really need HVAC vents! Reminds me a lot of my 2006 TSX with a manual only better"
acura,ilx,2014,ryhi, 12/08/2016,Second hand ILX 2.4L 6MT,pos,"I was looking for a good commuter with a manual transmission I could hold on to of the next 15 years. I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda
 F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.

acura,ilx,2014,scorpio69er, 03/18/2014,Ignore the automotive writers and just drive one yourself,pos,"I own the 2014 ILX base 2.0L 5-sp auto. First off, the 150 hp engine is just fine, thanks. I can cruise at 80 mph on the interstate all day long. I've had no issues running at very high altitude climbing fairly steep grades, and getting up to speed is quick at about 8 sec 0-60 -- once the engine is broken in. It's also economical. I'm averaging 30 mpg with ~8K miles of mixed driving. The differences between the 2014 and 2013 are not minor. The 2014 now comes standard with heated leather seats (driver's is powered), rear-backup camera, 17"" alloys, and additional sound deadening, including active noise reduction. I'm 6'1"" and I fit in the car just fine. Go test drive one yourself."
acura,ilx,2014,zoomjag, 03/28/2015,What you expect from the driver's seat isn't what this $31k Civic delivers.,pos,"Disappointing with time.  This vehicle doesn't feel like a comprehensive 'package' - It's an economy car, that's it.  Acura has taken a Civic (which is perfectly good as is) added a great dash, and some engine and suspension tuning and called it a day, and these mechanical touches don't really seem to add anything to the Civic package nor compete with the Civic Si(as if engineers just threw ""good parts"" at the car without testing). In many ways, the result here is an underpowered, loud, econobox with disturbing views from the drivers seat (funhouse drivers mirror, subpar plastic on the lower doors, blindspots for days) with a stereo that doesn't deliver premium sound leave you expecting more"
acura,ilx,2014,pwdrday, 09/11/2014,Fun little car,pos,"When I started looking at this car, I found it to be mediocre on paper.    Acceleration, handling, mpg, etc all seemed acceptable, but it didn't stand out.  However, I ended up taking a test drive because manual transmission cars have become hard to find, and they were giving big discounts.  After a test drive though, I realized that this car was something special, and the more I drive it the more I like it.  I'm happy to say that this car has a much higher fun factor than I originally expected.  The clutch and transmission are just a pure joy to use.  It's definitely the nicest manual transmission I've ever had, including multiple VWs, a Saab, and multiple Subarus.  The engine also loves to rev and has a wonderful sound for a 4 cyl.  It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.  However, if you are OK with the normal noise levels found in Hondas/Acuras, this is a great choice for a little sporty car!

acura,ilx,2014,wdc6446, 05/11/2015,Love it,pos,"The more I drive this car, the more I love it.  Like many others, I was a little worried I would miss having a turbo but loved the combination of economy, luxury,reliability and good looks that this car offered, at a price I could feel good about. Feels sporty, smooth, and responsive. I can honestly say I haven't missed the horsepower. I can't believe it doesn't get better reviews.  I have the Tech package, and love the bluetooth, the navigation, and the sound.  I rarely get less than 30 mpg and that with considerable city driving.  When you give it gas, it has a healthy rev, and cruises very comfortably at 70-80mph.  Passing is never a problem. "
acura,ilx,2014,1speedbike, 03/15/2014,There's more to life than horsepower!,pos,"Was apprehensive at first considering the HP ratings, BUT for the price this car can't be beat! Lots of high-tech and comfort features for <$30K. Heated power comfy seats, rear camera, voice integration, bluetooth, active noise cancellation, NAV, leather, sleek styling. This is NOT just an ""upgraded Civic.""

Obviously, engine leaves you wanting, but its buttery smooth and loves to rev, and is plenty for highway passing. Suspension is not too taut like a sports car, but not overly soft. Steering is typical Honda light, but also responsive. Great handling for FWD. Also, super LIGHT car with consistent 30 mpg.

Other than power, it has everything I could ask for in an entry luxury sedan. "
acura,ilx,2014,bybchucky, 03/02/2014,Excellent Commuter Car,pos,"I recently purchased an ILX with the Tech pkg, and I am very pleased with it. I had a 2008 Acura TL prior to purchasing this car, and I thought I would miss the V6 acceleration, but I honestly don't. A lot of the reviews say the 150 hp is underpowered, but I find the car to be adequate. In fact, it picks up quite nicely on the highway and I don't have trouble passing cars. The interior is nice, well built, and feels a lot wider than what the outside appearance would make you believe. The rear leg room is also excellent considering this is a compact car. As stated above, this is an excellent commuter car."
acura,ilx,2014,pda2, 02/26/2014,Excellent Value!,pos,"Well, I have the smaller engine in the automatic and it aint a beast..but with the shifter paddles
you can manipulate the gears slightly for a little bit more oooumph. From a quality to price standpoint, this is VERY hard to beat. I looked at Chevy's, Toyota's, even the Mazda 3 and 6, all similar price points. The quality inside and lines out, make this look like and feel like a much more respectable and high quality ride. What car would you rather show up in at a clients house? What car would you rather trust with a child inside? LCD screen is VERY small BUT the trunk holds 2 sets+ of golf clubs. It rides very smooth, seats adjust easily, the interface is user friendly with simple buttons "
acura,ilx,2014,Tommy, 01/28/2016,Reliable and luxurious,pos,"My family has had a few acuras. We have always loved them. From an Mdx with 200k+ miles to brand new RL's. Great ride, sleek look, great gas, inexpensive to maintain compared to other cars in this class.

acura,ilx,2015,stevenrose, 10/06/2014,My ILX is a great car,pos,"Update: My ILX has only continued to perform better with each mile.  The engine and transmission are as smooth as silk and it feels spritley.  It also looks great.  Great car!!!  I really enjoy owning my ILX.  The ILX offers a great value.  For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17"" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.  On the highway you don't even realize you have hit 80 because it is pretty smooth.  Road noise is the only downfall, but when you are listening to the great stereo you don't hear a thing.   If you read some reviews I think they are unfair, the car is excellent.  I test drove the Audi A3 1.8T and the turbo and love the ILX by far.

acura,ilx,2015,NicBran, 10/04/2015,Great entry level luxury car,pos,"Before purchasing this car, I had a Mazda RX-8 which I had owned for 9 years.  I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest ""want"" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of ""gliding"" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to ""gliding"" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying ""It is a beautiful car, it sells itself"".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8.

It handles great on curvy roads, the seats feel like they were made for me. The price was even reasonable for the performance and comfort. This is the best manual I have ever driven, it's smooth, it's fast and it's so much fun! I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty, yet functional car."

acura,ilx,2016,Shane Gochenouer, 09/02/2015,I LOVE this car!,pos,"This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and ""Build and Price"" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call ""practical luxury"". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. 

The only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11"" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).

UPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Holly Swanson, 04/30/2016,I love it,pos,"I absolutely adore this car. I have no idea what some people are talking about regarding the seats being uncomfortable. These are the most comfortable seats I've ever driven in. This car is just what I was looking for...a beautiful, reliable and luxurious commuter. The white model really turns heads and by the first week I'd already gotten so many compliments. Interior road noise is perfect, road feel is excellent, steering is excellent, ever little detail in his car screams luxury. Really nothing bad I can say about this car, and no I've not been paid to say these things...this car is just that good.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Eric, 04/30/2016,Hard to Categorize,pos,"This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.  You have to read between the lines.

acura,ilx,2016,ILX2016, 01/02/2016,Best Value - Entry level luxury sedan,pos,"If you're in the market for an entry level luxury sedan, you're most likely considering the Audi A3, MB CLA or the BMW 320, along with the ILX. Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart; but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.

Considering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category.
"
acura,ilx,2016,barry, 08/28/2015,Solid Commuting Car,pos,"I use this car almost exclusively for commuting, about 20 miles each way. It's a good solid car with great value. Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.

Pros:
Great value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.

Cons:
Transmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it.

I never had any problems with my 2013 and really like the updates on the new one. Performance is up due to the new engine but the old one was efficient and peppy. Good ride quality and very good value in the entry level luxury class. Compare to A3, CLA feature for feature and you'll see what I mean."
acura,ilx,2016,carfever, 02/06/2016,Bells and Whistle Galore!,pos,"I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!
PRO:
($30,000 out the door)
This is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  
CON:
If you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like ""oh my! you got a new Mercedes or Audi!). But you know what? I got good price and great value for my car so F the neighbor...haha!
"
acura,ilx,2016,Gagan, 07/14/2016,Excellent for its price & quality,pos,"Have own the fully loaded Tech plus A-SPEC ILX with the bigger 18"" wheels, GPS and all.
First what it lacks: 1. A HUD, which I feel is a must for all luxury cars
2. Lack of lumbar support
3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.
4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.
5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!

The Good parts:
1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!
2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.
3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.
4. Cost & maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!
The german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.
5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.

The problems I've faced with mine:
1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.
2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.
3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash & tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!
I would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!

acura,ilx,2016,jrasero, 06/21/2016,Maybe not a German killer but one heck of a value,pos,"Just traded my 2016 RDX Base for the 2016 ILX Premium.  Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it's loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn't as luxurious and doesn't perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can't ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can't have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.  The Premium with Blind Spot, cross traffic alert, real Milano leather, and the two tier screen system are worth every penny.

acura,ilx,2016,Dorenes car, 08/11/2016,More for the money!!,pos,"We were searching for a good lease rate and reliable vehicle that was stylish and had good ratings.  This car has a sports car feel, fun to drive, and handles beautifully (except for a small turning radius)!  The stripped down version gets you a sunroof, backup camera, and very nice front seat, all safety features, great Bluetooth,  all for less than many non-luxury compacts, including the Civic, which has higher lease costs and less features for the price.  Well worth our investment!!

acura,ilx,2016,Eddie Estares, 09/28/2016,Just the right car.,pos,"My 2nd Acura to date and just like the previous one, it's been great. Excellent highway mileage of 39 mi/gallon and is not a slouch if you want speed. The car handle really well around corners and have a very good braking system. We currently have 6 Honda made products; 2 Civic (2005 and 2007), 2 CRV (2009 and 2013), the Ilx, and a lawn mower and all have been super reliable. I place reliability above anything else and my experience with Honda cars have been excellent. Both Civicc and the 2009 CRV have way over 100k miles and not one ever had a single problem. I don't expect less from a Honda built automobile and I don't expect less from the Acura either."
acura,ilx,2016,KS, 02/26/2018,An Expensive Civic No More!,pos,"I am quite familiar with the 2013 ILX and it was a great disappointment.  The refreshed 2016 ILX is what we expected in 2013, but instead got an expensive Honda Civic.  The 2016 feels much more premium and is quieter on the road.  The suspension feels tighter and more solid.  The exterior refresh is quite nice; it gives it a sportier look, but still looks like a luxury vehicle.  The greatest attribute of this car is the 8 speed duel clutch transmission, that is paired with the 2.4L engine.  The K24 is already a seasoned and beloved motor and this new 8 speed DCT is incredible.  The shifts are smooth, quick, and the rev-match down shifting is addicting.  This truly is the best compromise between an automatic and manual transmission.  This is my sister's car, which already has 47,000 miles on it and no problems have occurred.  That is no surprise, as my dad has an 09 TSX with 95k(never using the required premium gas) and never a repair once.  My father is now eyeing to replace his TSX with the ILX A-Spec and I too, will now be in the market for one, as well.

acura,ilx,2016,Ronnie, 12/07/2015,Not as thrill asi thought to be,pos,"I came from a manual stick shift 2003 Acura RSX Type S. I love that car and the only reason why I stick with Acura. I need a small compact 4 doors vehicle since I'm a family man with two kids. I looked at the Civics, the Accords. But they just blah and not exciting in terms of styling. Plus. I didn't want to be like 80% of the car out there on the road, so many of them. From teeny boppers, grandma's, Grandpa, to your soccer moms. No thanks. 

So there it is, I got the 2016 Acura ILX with premium/Aspec package. Honestly, its not really an upgrade from my RSX. Everything about this car feel cheap and could be better. Feels like they are rushing it. The gears always shifting. It can never stay in one gear long, it always shift to make sure the gears are highest fuel economy at the current speed. It's good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration. Coming from a cable, maybe it have to do with the new electric drive by wire, who knows but its really annoying when you need that quick acceleration. Now on the other hand, the Dual Clutch mode is awesome, stellar and works perfectly. I think that pretty much the only part of the car that stands out. Very responsive, smooth gear transition from downshift and up shift. The steering is numb and you don't feel that much road feed back. The handling is good. Not much body roll. The car puts me to sleep. I need some excitement, the thrill of a screaming VTEC kicking in. Instead I got a very boring tone. The seat doesnt have much bolster to snug you in. I feel Acura lost touch with its racing heritage. My other pet peeve is the head room, I'm 5'11"" but it really cramp in there. Only about in of space left from the ceiling to my head.  I will probably pass this car to my wife in a few more years and get myself a stick shift car. 

If you like driving like grandma, just chill, relax, cruising and looking good in it. Then this car is for you.

acura,ilx,2016,PJ, 02/15/2016,Deserves one more star but please read it.,pos,"I got my car back in April of 2015. Reason I took off one star is squeaky front brakes issue.  It's factory defect and acura is aware of it (Please google on tgat issue if you are interested). Acura did not want to change my brakes at time I came in and I don't have any more time to waste with them so I live with it.  It's a huge disappointed  especially for a brand such as acura. 

Another star I taken off because I believe few other things could have been better.  Such as,  very rough ride over uneven pavement and especially potholes. No 40/60 rear fold,  whole rear seat just folds.  Steering is a little numb as well. Not too much headroom for tall drivers. 

Never the less its an enormous value. For $27k you get compact (a plus for some)  0-60 in less than 7 seconds,  great fuel economy,  decent handling,  sunroof,  keyless entery,  duel clutch transmission,  full Led head lights,  Adaptive cruise,  crush prevention system, auto dual climate, heated seats and mirrors,  back up cam,   Acura badge (Might matter to some.

acura,ilx,2016,Melissa, 04/17/2016,Bought 2 in one year,pos,"Ok....so after driving my Mini Cooper hardtop and commuting 70 miles a day 6 days a week I decided it was time to trade in the stick shift and grow up. After looking at all the entry level luxury vehicles, I decided on the Acura ILX. My situation is, I wanted economical luxury. I wanted a car I could drive until the wheels fell off. I wanted a car that I didn't have to make difficult appointments for to get serviced or maintained. I didn't want to worry about what service needed to be done when the service due light came on....a burden I had driving the mini. For me, this car works great! I bought the premium package in black right around when they launched the 2016's... Drove it for a year and realized I had made a huge mistake. Black is a horrible color to keep clean when you commute and don't park in a garage! So when I took my car in today for its second ever service, I was somehow made an offer I couldn't refuse on a brand new white premium with ASPEC. There is a major difference between the two. I love the ASPEC seats and odometer and foot pedals. The front looks less like a beak! I'm so glad I upgraded! Maintence is painless and affordable! No stress car for younger commuter! I'm happy!

***update 1 year later.  This car is a great commuter and is so easy for me to get serviced. No hassle ! I'm so glad I got a white car because I think I only washed it 4 times in a year! I'm driving the heck out of it and it's great!  Only complaint is the scraping if you exit a driveway or take a dip too fast.. you must be very very slow since the front end sits kind of low. Other than that, no complaints so far!

acura,ilx,2016,Ken Mason, 02/07/2016,"Great Car, Fun to drive",pos,"No one is paying me to write this review.  Just thought you'd like to know.  I sincerely don't understand Edmund's grade of ""C"" for the ILX.  I drove the Lexus IS 200t.  Yes, it was very smooth and very powerful.  But it costs almost $10,000 more than the ILX.  And has anyone noticed that the front grill of the Lexus looks like the mask for Darth Vader?  I'm sorry, but once that picture became fixated in my mind, I just couldn't stand looking at it any longer.  I also drove the BMW 228i.  A little more money than the ILX but with half the standard features and honestly, I didn't feel much difference between the BMW and the ILX.  I love the look of the ILX with the Prem and Aspec package.  The spoiler and upgraded wheels make the vehicle.  The upgraded interior is also really nice and the seats have a nice sporty feel to them.  The acceleration for this 200 hp engine is tremendous.  Okay, so I also drive my 013 Toyota Tacoma so getting into the ILX is like getting into my own sports car.  I like the sound of the engine and I like the feel of the road.  We also own a 014 Acura RDX and it drives like a charm.  My only tiny complaint is I wish Acura would make a coupe the size of the new TLX or the ILX.

Updated review....Still fun to drive, just not as fun as I first thought
The 8 speed transmission lags when extra speed is needed. Also, the transmission kinda jerks when it is down-shifting and then I need to punch it to accelerate. Also there is a rattle that just drives me crazy. It is a fun car to drive. I'm not sure I will buy another ILX. Who knows.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Don Sutton, 08/09/2016,Can I have my TSX Back Please?,pos,"This is my 3rd Honda and my 2nd Acura. After 300K+ miles and 11 years, I gave my old 2004 TSX to my son who is still driving it. 
I decided to lease a new 2016 ILX after Acura did the redesign of the exterior and put back the peppy and quick VR4 that was in my TSX. 
On the plus side, the car is just like the TSX: great handling, terrific on corners and curves, super reliable, solid feel, awesome braking, beautiful long drive on the road touring vehicle, takes 5 passengers around town comfortably with room for luggage, and gets lots of compliments on the styling and interior design. Gas mileage is okay - but not the 29 mpg average promised. Only getting 27 consistently when 1-2 passengers, much less with a full car. 
On the minus side, I wish the car was like the TSX: the dual screen technology seems redundant and is very distracting compared to the single touch screen the TSX had, the acceleration is hesitant - the car seems to 'think' about moving faster before it actually goes into gears. Gas mileage sucks in city driving. Freeway is 31mpg only, not the 35mpg promised. UPDATE after 1 Year: Exterior pain gets stained easily. Design flaw. Looks like the clear coat is easily damaged by on road flying liquids. 
OVERALL: Great car, just wish Honda/Acura had not removed the 'fun' and 'simple' aspect of the TSX. Sadly, sometimes I want to take back my old TSX from my son and give him the ILX....

acura,ilx,2016,I'm sold on Acura, 12/09/2017,Better than my A4,neg,"Was talked into buying a 2016 ILX certified pre-owned with 2,000 miles and it was the best life decision I have made.  Premium  (leather pwr pass /drvr seats, etc.) Acura Watch Plus fully loaded (not A Spec) with 100,000 bumper to bumper, free roadside assistance, those expensive rubber trunk/floor mats,and 7 complimentary oil changes /tire rotations for $27,000 and 0% financing.  It handles like my old 1997 A4 Quattro 6 speed and not like the over priced, poorly designed, bastard-driving Audi's-BMWs-Mercs of this generation.  I used the paddle shifters to easily drive through icy conditions and felt incredibly safe.  It corners as well as my old A4, looks great, and with the Acura Watch Plus, I feel safer than I did in my large SUV.  Use your turn signal and the car tells you everything around you.  Forget about the turn signal light on the side mirrors, you don't need it.   Rear camera, lane departure, adaptive cruise, brake warning, BLIS, all standard with the Acura Watch Plus.  The best part is the driver can not only manually enable and disable, but also modify the settings for almost each feature.  Couldn't do that with the Volvo, Audi, BMW or Merc I test drove.  Got a job in LA and drove this car I-40 from NC to CA and at one point on cruise control, I looked down and the meter registered 500 miles before empty.  Normal city driving is usually closer to 350 miles per tank. Cruising at 90+ felt like 55...so watch the speedometer.  The nav system takes about 20 seconds to register once you start the car, but it got me through 2500 miles and not one wrong turn.  It even automatically reset the time zones for me.  I knew exactly where I was all the time.  The complaints about its awkwardness is probably from some professional reviewer who was paid by Volvo. The bluetooth is clean and clear and Siri sync works 99.5% of the time if only Apple would update software more often.  If I had to complain, the pass through is right at the wheel house, so it narrows and you lose about 12 inches of space where the seat drops.  But I was still able to load the trunk with two 40"" LED TVs with oops I forget to pack this in the moving van room to spare.  People are really impressed with its comfort and style.  I drove 2500 miles in 3 days and the seat was incredibly comfortable.   Best part is I laugh when I pull up to get gas and all the PREMIUM UNLEADED people watch their $$$ pour right into their tank.  My 1997 Audi was great, but when it needed repairs $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  and $$.   I've owned American muscle cars and European sport sedans and a crappy Nissan Maxima swearing I would NEVER buy a Japanese car again.  This Acura is the best car I've EVER owned and I know I will easily and safely get over 100,000 or miles out of it.  Shhhh... don't let the secret get out.

My last acura, i had storage in the middle compartment, doors, and behind seats. It doesn't have an overhead storage for glasses either. Besides those minor challenges, the car handles great, i haven't really openned it up, i just reached 1500 miles on it. I am happy with the car, acura makes very good products, look forward to enjoy car for a long time

acura,ilx,2016,Bec703, 09/05/2016,Electronic safety systems reduce driving effort,pos,"**NOTE**  ILX not TLX -- I liked everything about this car except for a few items -. Hate the speech recognition system: doesn't recognize my commands, very inflexible command structure,. Cabin noise is to high with the premium tires, the navigation system is not compressive with current systems., even, no speed limit indication, messy to input destinations and 2nd waypoints. The good thing is Siri works well and does understand voice commands. Likes: snappy, 8 speed transmission is outstanding, Best reason to own are the electronic safety controls.  These take about 50% of the effort out of long distance driving.  Also getting 39 mpg on highway trips. Low roof for tall people

acura,ilx,2016,Raul, 01/11/2019,Just an Ok Car,pos,"I purchased the car in 2016. I purchased it for the technology and safety features. It’s been OK. The navigation is very slow.

acura,ilx,2016,ejko, 02/17/2019,Almost Right,pos,"This car is almost a great car.  The transmission is a bit jerky, particularly when driven at a leisurely pace.  You sit very low in this car.  As Time went on, getting in and out of this car became increasingly irritating.  My wife and I are in our 60s; this may not be of consequence to young people.  I never had a problem with the car; for me it was very reliable.

acura,ilx,2016,Donald Bassett, 07/29/2015,Issues with infotainment,pos,"This is my first Acura and generally I am very happy.  I haven't had it in for the first service yet but wanted to know if anyone is having issues with the infotainment system.  About once a week when I start the car the radio stations will come up with all the programmed numbers wrong.  The stations are correct if you select them but the numbers displayed are wrong.  Sometimes it will correct itself after a while and sometimes it won't.  Twice the backup camera has not gone off when I shift out of reverse and the upper display stays on the back up camera the entire time I am driving.  Next time I start it will go back to normal.
"
acura,ilx,2016,Tim S, 03/09/2016,Swing and a miss,neg,"I bought this car because after test driving it reminded me of my '07 Civic Si, which I sold to go back to school, only a bit more refined. However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. 

I'll start with the positives: The engine is good; it's a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it's working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it's an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.

Now to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver's seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don't like to crank lumbar up to 11, you're not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you’re going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there’s the fact that in the best position I’ve found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.

The rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here’s the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling; leather wrap on the steering wheel; stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)’ phone call quality; ease of using phone controls…pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it’s made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. 

So you might think that if you don’t care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren’t for the issue with the driver’s seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si.

acura,ilx,2016,Jim, 07/23/2016,55 months- 98000 miles,pos,"Like other Hondas I have owned in the past, this 2016 ILX has been flawless. It doesn't drive like a BMW or Audi, but it handles very well and the ride is good, except on rough pavement. I love all of the tech gadgets and the sound system is good. I live in the city, but most of my work commute is on the highway.  I am a stickler for gas mileage and this car does not disappoint. It routinely gets over 40 mpg on the highway, averages 36 in mixed driving, and has never clocked less than 31 mpg (winter) on a tank of gas. I run it with regular gas and have seen no difference in performance compared to premium.

acura,ilx,2016,Cheryl Steeper, 03/22/2017,So Very Disappointed!,pos,"Wanted to stay with Honda products, having been an owner of Honda or Acura since 1980.  Like the exterior styling of this car very much.  However, I have a spine condition and find the buckets are too deep and make my back hurt after 30 minutes.  Hate the hesitation with acceleration & feel like I'm driving a tank, but need to make allowances here since I am coming for a car that has 260 hp.  Wish I had gone for the Navi on upper level package because there is a stupid black screen behind the clock that is distracting.  The cabin feels claustrophobic and small.  The seating adjustments are not enough.  I'm trying to find a seat cushion to fix the bucket issue, but everything pushes my head into the headliner.  I've had this car for 3.5 weeks and am counting the days until I can sell it & get something else.  I've sat in every Honda and Acura product and only found 3 seats that were comfortable for my back...Honda Fit & HR-V, and Acura TLX.  Latter is too big and hated the push buttons (had those on my teenage car and not going back!), car also too big.  Fit is OK, but feels like I'm downgrading from old Acura.  HR-V was OK, but don't want an SUV.  Finishes on interiors of Honda & Acura products really cheaped out now.  Still looking for something to replace this Acura ILX.  SOOOOO very disappointed in Honda/Acura now.  Feeling really let down by this manufacturer.

acura,ilx,2016,Monica, 06/25/2017,Expensive Name with Basic Entertainment,neg,"Very disappointed in the hands-free system when in actuality it's Hands-On. You can only dial numbers that are stored in your speed dial other than that you are having to use your phone to dial numbers. While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn't have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn't make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be. I feel as though for this car to be as expensive as it is that this Siri radio should have come along with it. But no it's a basic radio station with speakers that are not loud at all and there's no touchscreen to do anything. This is by far the worst car I've bought and wish I would have kept my Hyundai Elantra which features on the inside were so much better than this Acura and I paid 10 - 15 G less. I've contacted Acura numerous of times with only to be told that this will go in a file for my complaints. I sure wish  they would give me another car with the features that are  basic in other cars or buy this one back. This is a $30,000 car and I am so disappointed in it . I advised them that I would sell them this car back in a heartbeat and now I'm stuck with an expensive car with basic features and a High car payment. So definitely think twice about buying the ILX because you will really be disappointed in the features that they offer you in such an expensive body.
Review: nothing has changed for the better. No room in car and I've almost received ticket due to having my phone in hand for trying to make a phone call because the Calling system in the car is poorly done.  I've call the company and they still have not tried to rectify my problem or even offer me a better car from my money. Their attitude is oh well. They may would have helped me If I was of political or entertainment status.

acura,ilx,2016,Jeff, 03/29/2016,"The good , the bad, and the ugly",neg,"I was looking forward to driving this car because I liked the styling and have owned two Acura TL's. After owning 10 Honda's also , I thought I'd check it out
The car has a nice cockpit but no lumbar support or adjustment so it was out for me with back issues. It is laid out nicely but storage is the least I've seen in any other car. console compartment is small and cheap feeling and the door storage can fit a tennis ball??
My main compmaint is a general one with the CVT transmission on ANY car. It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse 
Over al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars. I just want to actually enjoy the driving experience. Acura is only better than Honda of you can spend over $30K. The Civic is a superior car to the ILX and less expensive. Back to Honda or maybe Subaru

acura,ilx,2016,Steven Rosengren, 07/25/2015,I love my new 2016 Acura ILX,pos,"I ended up trading in my 2016 Acura ILX after owning it for only 3 months.  There was a brake defect where the brakes kept squeaking and after the rotors were replaced once and pads twice, the issue came back.  I think a recall will come at some point, but I was not going to wait because I was very disappointed.  The other Acura's I have owned have been great, I was very surprised that this car was released with this issue.  I traded it for a Mazda CX-3 and it is more fun to drive and and feels more powerful then the Acura.   The other issue with the Acura I noticed was the engine hum, it actually bothered my ears when I had the windows open.  The 2014 Acura ILX I had I liked better overall after owning this one for 3 months.  Before purchasing ask the dealership to give you one of their loaner cars that has a few miles on it and make sure you like driving it in everyday driving.  I would recommend buying a used 2013-2015 ILX instead.  Or a Mazda 3, I think the Mazda 3 GT would be more fun to drive everyday than the Acura.

acura,ilx,2017,Victoria Smyth, 09/09/2017,Great car at a fantastic price,pos,"I bought this car to replace a 2001 Integra.  This car is different (let's face it.  There are few cars available today which are going to handle like the Integra.). Most modern vehicles have electric steering (ugh) and McPherson struts or something similar.  The double wishbone is gone for the most part.  HOWEVER, although this car is different, it is still a lot of fun to drive.  It handles extremely well with a lot of horsepower for its size.  The steering is good for electric and there is good feedback.  This is he first automatic I have owned in many decades of driving.  My advice: put it in sport mode, step on the gas and look for some winding roads.  You won't regret it!

March 2018.  It is 7 months on and there has not been a single problem with this vehicle.  It handles pretty well in the snow.  It handles well on wet pavement. It is nimble and very quick on dry pavement. I drive in comfort mode to commute and it responds very well when I need to merge into traffic.  CR rated the ride poor, but I don't find it so.  I think it is perfect for a ""sport sedan"".  I've hit a few very bad potholes with no serious side effects. Two minor complaints: the armrests are too low and there is no dome light.  Otherwise, it is excellent.

Three years on, the car is great.  Only oil changes and inspections so far.  Gets 32 mpg in mixed highway and city driving.  Love it.

acura,ilx,2017,SDA, 12/15/2016,Regressing but still worthy,pos,"Feels like Honda literally sent Acura a civic LX and they ""pimped your ride"" with some leather and such. Back in 2007 with my first new Acura, the TSX was with navi or not, and came fully loaded with all the other features and was tons of fun to drive, especially in the twisties (mine was a 6 speed manual). Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you're nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. ""Pleather"" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you'll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days. If you want a touch screen entertainment system you'll pony up $2,000 for the premium package and also get some nick-nack features like perforated leather and blind spot detection. If not you're stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17"" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it's trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it's higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000. Truthfully it really is just a very comfortable, better looking Civic that you can lease for under $300 a month with $0 down, however, it may be the best thing you can get for that price in the luxury market.

acura,ilx,2017,Tricia, 07/20/2017,Snazzy Little Car,pos,"When we decided to buy a new car we looked at the Honda Accord, Subaru Legacy and the ILX.  The Subaru had a lot of safety features but wasn't very attractive. Honda surprisingly didn't ride that smoothly and if I wanted all the bells and whistle was very pricey. We have a 2006 TL and it has been a great car so we decided to look at Acura and the last car we saw was the ILX and it was IT!  The ride was smooth and had much more power than I thought it would, it has all the bells and whistles I wanted and the safety features that Subaru has.  We were able to get the Tech Plus for a price lower than both the Honda and Subaru with the features we got.  I've had the car a couple of weeks and the gas mileage is great and I'm truly enjoying it.  I've had several people comment on how good looking the car is.  I see other reviews slamming this car but this  60 year old Nana with a snazzy red little car couldn't be happier.

acura,ilx,2017,Redwings15, 12/12/2016,Fantastic Entry Level Luxury Vehicle,pos,"Overall extremely pleased with my new ILX. The vehicle is attractive to the eye with quality panel fit and finish and a stunning paint job. The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle.

Than I fell in love with my ILX, It was the best car I have driven out of all the four cars I listed. I drive 45 minutes from my house to Manhattan and it was saving me money and was a quiet and comfortable ride. I had a 2012 Passat SEL but I had so many problems and waste so much money that If I add all the maintenance prices plus the passat I could have boughten I Lexus or BMW, So I got the ILX.

The vehicle is a luxury Honda. Honda is the co-parent of Acura and therefore it is to be a ""pimped"" out Honda. That is the sole purpose for starting Acura.

acura,ilx,2017,Laurel Blue, 10/16/2016,A new Dud,neg,"I just leased a new 2017 Acura ILX two months ago. This was the seventh Acura I've owned or leased, beginning with the 5 cylinder Vigor many years ago. I loved each and every one of these cars...except this one. I HATE it. There should be a warning sign on these- ""Watch out! Buy this if you're a dummy."" The ""new"" 8 gear transmission, with two clutches, is way too complex and does not offer performance as Acura bills it. The car hunts for gears as you accelerate, and has very little power from 10mph to 40 mph when you are accelerating. The car lugs in the lower gears. My previous car, a 2014 Acura ILX was perfection itself. I should have kept it. The most annoying aspect of this new car? The muffler. Acura is apparently ignoring its traditional (loyal) adult audience and seeking to attract new users that are young men in their 20's. So they have ""boosted"" the HP, but this is not accurate. The car is much less powerful than before, despite the claims for higher HP. And it is supposed to be thriftier on gas, but so far (I now have a little under 2000 miles) it is not as much of a gas-saver as was my 2014 Acura ILX.  The worst thing? The muffler. It is noisy as all get-out. I suppose this was to attract those young males. I would do anything to get a different muffler that is quiet. I do not wish to hear the constant ""throaty growl"" Acura has decided is necessary.  I keep thinking 33 tortured months to go...Arrgh.

acura,ilx,2018,Fred, 09/20/2018,Very good car for the money,pos,"I always admired this car when I saw it driving or parked. So I went to the dealer to test drive it. I was impressed with acceleration, steering feel, handling and overall ride. The interior is not luxurious but it has a sporty upscale aura to it.  The exterior lines and design also look quite sporty . I ended up leasing it for much less than the competition (Audi A3, BMW 3 series, Mercedes Benz CLA, Lexus IS, Infiniti Q50 among others) .Overall it's a fun car to drive and I feel like it offers a great value in the crowded and very competitive  entry level compact sedan category.  The base offers everything I wanted- A  peppy 2.4 /201 HP engine (more than some of the more expensive competitors), moon roof, heated leatherette seats , power drivers seats, heated mirrors , rain sensing wipers, steering wheel controls for Bluetooth, audio , cruise and more......  If you want more options like navigation, safety features and various other upgrades the payment rises accordingly , but still less than every other competitor. I also test drove mainstream compact sedans such as the Honda Civic , Nissan Sentra and Mazda 3 all drove terrific as well but the prices were too close to the more powerful Acura ILX.
"
acura,ilx,2018,Graham, 05/03/2019,Love/Hate,pos,"Last June 2019 I sold my ILX lease to Carvana and pretty much broke even financially. The reason for that is I got my hands on a 2014 Acura TSX Tech package with 29k miles, black/black. The car had one owner, clean CarFax, certified, and Acura dealer maintained.

I would say finding a 5-year-old car with all that is a rare find. I love having another TSX and the reliability, handling, and quality puts the ILX to shame. Having said all that the ILX was a fantastic car, and I do miss certain things, such as the push start, and peppy engine. I would still highly recommend it to anyone in the market.

acura,ilx,2018,john, 08/31/2018,smaller is better,pos,"I had been driving an Acura TL and then TLX's for the past 13 years and I enjoyed most of the features across the board. Despite the average ratings for the ILX I took it for a test drive and I liked everything about it, so I bought it. I am very pleased with the overall performance, handling, style, etc. The UBS port is very awkward to access, the bluetooth voice is poor, and the screen graphics are not so good. Also, if you are over six feet tall you will have to lower your seat otherwise your head will be hitting the roof.

acura,ilx,2018,Nicole, 12/04/2018,Acura ILX 2018 MAJOR ISSUES,pos,"This is my third ILX because I LOVE this car, everything about it including the price was on point. However, I recently leased a 2018 and since day one I have had problems. Second day I had it, the car stalled in the middle of end of day traffic. Come to find out that there are problems with the fuel gauge and electrical panel on the 2018 ILX that I was unaware of. Currently, I have to fill my tank every 200 miles until the part comes in. It's been over a month and a half, and I am still waiting for the part to come in to fix this issue.  My car has stalled 3-4 times, hasn't started on several occasions, and frankly I am not happy. Maybe its the way I am being pushed to the side, and Acura dealership hasn't even offered a loaner or to replace the car, but this is BS.

The seat are not even manual on the passenger! It’s doesn’t have push start remote like civil or has navigation even the back up cam don’t have a beep sounds! It’s very very low grade then a Honda civil! Really not worth the price and quality!!

acura,ilx,2019,tom lordi, 01/16/2019,What's Not to Like?!,pos,"Great looking, and handles beautifully, and Made in America.  I am a bit disappointed in the electronics interface; all features are not as intuitive as I'd like and will take me on a steep learning curve.  It is feature packed - one of the reasons I purchased it - but again, the controls could be more intuitive.  Particularly impressive are the eight speed DC transmission, handling and the relatively quiet ride.  It's all I could have wanted and more at that price point.
"
acura,ilx,2019,Fritolay, 01/26/2019,Acura ILX or Honda Civic Si?,pos,"In my opinion, for about the same price, you get an Acura ILX which is based on the 9th Generation Civic vs. the current 10th Generation Civic, which is slightly larger and has about the same performance.  So why not buy the Civic?  Because the 9th Generation Civic was a tried and true model which was extremely reliable (read the reviews on the current 10th Generation Civic).  Additionally, you get a VTEC engine instead of the much reported problematic Earth Dreams engine (read about fuel & oil issues), a dual-clutch transmission instead of the expensive to repair CVT transmission, and new refined styling unlike the love it/hate it polarizing Civic styling.   In a nutshell, you get a very reliable Honda Civic Si without the reported problematic components, which is dressed in a fancy new tuxedo with nicer paint and a better warranty.  A wolf in sheep's clothing.

acura,ilx,2019,Capt Larry Reimer, 03/15/2019,3rd Honda - this one in Acura Suit,pos,"I've owned 3 Honda Products - a 2012 Civic Si Sedan, 2018 Civic Hatchback Sport Manual and now this 2019 ILX A-Spec Sedan. I've read the Reviews which mostly pan this car as a ""warmed-over 9th Gen Civic"" - take it from a past owner - this is NO Civic - it has Honda reliability with the tried and proven 2.4L NON-Turbo engine and a really great Dual-clutch 8 Speed Auto. As a Manual Fan I can say this DC Auto is really nice and I'm not missing the Manuals anymore. To give some factual and real-world comparisons based on experience and facts - I bought a new 87 BMW M5 sedan in 1987 - owned it for 10 years and 65,000 miles. If you'll check for yourselves you'll see that the exterior dimensions are almost exactly the same as this ILX - M5 was 256HP (inline 6) with 5-speed Manual where ILX is 201HP (inline 4) - M5 weighed 3450 lbs - ILX weighs 3144. M5 did 0-60 in 6.7 sec - ILX does 0-60 in 6.6 sec. The above are facts, not opinions. Have owned alot of HP machinery since trading my M5 in 1997 - and can honestly say I feel I've given up almost nothing between the 2 cars, and the M5 cost me $48,000 in 1987 and the ILX cost me $31,000 in 2019......32 years later. Don't believe the reports - this ILX A-Spec may be the Sleeper of the Quarter-Century. It's admittedly not ""today's fast"" but it sure is fast enough for me..................

acura,ilx,2019,Fred, 07/17/2019,By far the best sports sedan for the $$$!,pos,"I test drove many competitors before I settled with the 2019 Acura ILX- A-Spec - Tech.  For around 32K this loaded great looking sports sedan is a blast to drive. It's fast enough, handles great, the steering is a perfect balance not to loose (like most new cars these days) and not too firm.  I test drove the Lexus IS, Infiniti Q-50, Audi A-3, Benz   CLA and A-class, BMW 2 and 3 series, Jaguar XE, Genesis G70 and the Volvo S60.  These are all WAY more expensive to buy or lease with less features.  While they all drove fine (except for the CLA), the ILX proved to be by far the best sports sedan for the $$$.

acura,ilx,2019,Ken in Oregon, 02/13/2020,Some features make it a pain to own,pos,"We have owned three other Acuras, all of the TL family --and '03, '07 and a 2016 TLX. This go-round we decided to downsize to the ILX. I wish we didn't. We chose to go Acura after comparing to the Honda Civic, which wasn't as nice and had a much inferior engine-transmission package. But the 2019 ILX, while nice, isn't as nice as the TLX. Seats aren't as comfortable. The memory seats don't remember me very well. Seat heaters are either on or off, no degrees of heat. The ILX drives pretty well and if you keep the revs up can even feel a little sporty. Our biggest complaint is the size of the gas tank. It's barely over 10 gallons; the TLX had 17+. Where my wife had to the fill the TLX once every 6 weeks, the ILX barely makes three.

"
acura,ilx,2020,Rob, 05/14/2020,2020 ILX an Incredible Vehicle,pos,"Before purchasing this car, I did a TON of reading both professional and consumer reviews as well as watching YouTube review videos. Some professional reviewers get behind the wheel, floor the gas pedal, and then say it's noisy and not fast enough. But the truth is most drivers don't floor the gas in everyday driving. For a driver like myself going to work every day in a normal commute I found the car to be very quick and it also gives a quiet ride! The transmission and engine work very well together for an incredibly smooth driving experience, and both have proven long term reliability. The styling is great, and the fit and finish is quality. It's a very solid feeling car and mine has absolutely no squeaks or rattles. The ELS stereo system with surround sound blows me away and it's the best sound system I've ever heard in a car. The lower touch screen is solely dedicated to the sound system with integrated pandora capability as well as XM radio. The upper screen is dedicated to navigation as well as apple car play and android auto. Reviewers like to complain about the dual screen set up, but I think it's great! My one and only complaint about this car is that the navigation is very dated looking, but hey it works well anyway. The best part about this car is no doubt the value for the money. Compare it to other premium brands and you will pay thousands more, and you really cannot compared it to a non premium model such as a civic because it's truly a cut above in fit and finish. In a way it's in a class all by itself. Also great is that the cost of repair and normal maintenance is nowhere near what you will pay for other premium brands. So all in all I know I made a great decision in buying the ILX and look forward to driving this fun car for many years to come.
"
acura,ilx,2020,Scott, 07/04/2020,The Best Car I've Ever Owned,pos,"I first saw the ILX at the auto show near me in February and was immediately drawn in by its styling, logical controls, and price. My daily driver was a 2011 Civic at the time, which had been consistently reliable and had a nice character to it. (It's now my second/backup car; why get rid of a perfectly good vehicle?)
Honda's reputation for quality and reliability was the first factor in my decision to look further into this car. When I started researching it, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews. Then I realized what they were comparing the car to. This isn't one of those cars that young people drag down the freeway. It's also not an Audi or Mercedes in terms of price (I even cross-shopped the Mercedes-Benz A220 along with the Honda Accord). 
What this car truly represents is a step between mainstream vehicles (Accord, Camry, etc) and full-blown luxury (BMW 3 Series, Audi A4). It's a spot which, at one time, belonged to the Oldsmobile Cutlass. You bought a Cutlass to step up from Chevy and after you had your performance car phase with Pontiac. It wasn't a Cadillac, but you didn't need a Cadillac--just something that was a little nicer than your Malibu. Oldsmobile (and Mercury, for that matter) are long gone, so many people have trouble placing a ""step up"" model these days.
What the ILX gives you is a car that is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and is easy to use. Controls are often difficult to figure out on new cars; even something as simple as shifting into drive can be a challenge for someone who hasn't bought a new car in a while. The ILX uses traditional controls and was very easy to learn, even coming from a low-tech model like a 2011 Civic. It's also nice to see a car with a non-turbo engine and a regular automatic transmission rather than a CVT. You even get a CD player. Some of us appreciate the old-school touches like that, especially knowing what long term reliability and proven performance look like!
I have no problems with the interior materials, and I even sat in the A220 and rented an Evoque last year! The leather is high grade and the plastic, in no way, feels cheap. The steering wheel has a very nice feel to it as well.
The dual screen setup, to me, is a huge perk. I worked with a similar system on an older Accord a few years back and I'm shocked Honda seems to want to phase it out. It was easy to learn and works very well. Again, it's a proven winner.
Regarding comparisons to Civics--I have a Civic and have driven the current model. These are two entirely different vehicles in character and refinement. The Civic may have more performance options in the Si trim, but if you're buying the ILX, you're probably looking more for refinement, not to win a drag race. That's what this car gives you--a lot of luxury in a small package. Just because it's derived from the Civic doesn't make it a Civic. Remember, the CR-V was also derived from the Civic platform and is an entirely different vehicle. As a longtime Civic owner, I can also tell you that being related to the Civic is a good thing. Aside from age-related maintenance like a muffler and brakes, my Civic has never let me down, 145K miles later.
I drove an Accord as well and it's a similar car in terms of feel, but smaller. In fact, the ILX feels more like a small Accord with a few refinements. A comparably-equipped Accord is bigger, but $5000 more. If you don't consistently haul around passengers but want the luxury, go for the ILX. The Accord is a little bit quieter in terms of road noise if that matters to you, but also has a steeper learning curve with some controls.
To sum this up: test-drive the ILX and see for yourself what a wonderful car it really is. I've enjoyed every minute behind the wheel of mine since purchasing it and am looking forward to having it as my daily driver for a long time.

I Initially looked at the Lexus IS but it was $10,000 more and didn’t have all the standard features that my ILX did. Test drove it and it went above my expectations and I ended up taking it home. 😂😂 The only negative I can think of so far  is the infotainment system which can be confusing at first.
"
acura,ilx,2020,LawyerDave, 04/11/2020,Neither here nor there,pos,"I was leasing a Mazda3 premium plus. I loved that car and was inclined to get the new redesigned one, but had some negative feelings about the Mazda dealership experience. Against my better judgement I looked at the Acura ILX. Let me just saw that this car is inferior to the 3 in virtually every respect, and in some ways vastly inferior. But first, the positives: the headlights! This car has the best headlights ever. They illuminate the road extremely well under any circumstances such that I hardly ever use my high beams. Next, the value: it's easily the cheapest ""luxury""vehicle one can lease and you do get a great amount of tech for the money as long as you step up to the quite affordable premium package. Apple Carplay? Emergency braking? Lane departure warning? Sunroof? You've got it! And finally, the seats. Extremely comfortable. Everyone who sits in them makes the same observation. Now, the negatives: IT'S NOT A LUXURY CAR!!!!! Rear windows aren't automatic. Seriously? My Mazda had a vastly superior interior. It also had a vastly superior driving experience. Acura's DCT is a horrible transmission, never seeming to know which gear to be in at lower speeds. It hesitates before downshifting and flutters about annoyingly, irritating the driver and probably wasting gas. The 3 also ran circles around this car in terms of handling. The ILX does not do well in the twisties and the noises it makes and general way it behaves just does not inspire one to test its limits and push it harder. It's not completely awful but feels a lot more like a Toyota product, or maybe even an old Buick. Steering/handling are vague. 
Last but not least, the heating system: the weakest I have experienced in any vehicle, period. Unacceptably bad. I will leave it at that. 
One may wonder why I got this car given the above. It came down to price. Truthfully, I am paying less to lease it than I paid for the Mazda. And it is very cute looking. People tell me that all the time.

acura,ilx,2020,Tiss Uuu, 07/03/2020,"Luxury, AFRAID NOT, but it'll work for awhile",neg,"After owning it for 2 weeks my opinion is it looks great, engine has plenty of pep, steering is effortless but the road feel is distant. LED Lights are bright plus it has many of the safety collision warning features.. As for the build quality my impression is it's poor. Hood uses a metal rod for support, no shock/stay hood lift. Floor mats are very poor quality, Walmart's cheapies at least have rubber backing. There's NO SPARE TIRE! Instead they give you a small air compressor. NO jack or lug wrench but it has wheel locks. So when your sidewall blows or your flat has a hole bigger than a finish nail ensure you have someone who can bring you a new tire! Or be smart remove the foam parts holder where the spare goes and buy a temporary spare and scissor w/lug wrench and put it in it's place. I'm original owner of a 2003 CL-S 6cyl v-tech 6spd manual which is a much sounder and more exhilarating to drive which I'm keeping for fun.

acura,mdx,2001,Tango Papa, 07/19/2016,210K miles - going strong - paid for itself,pos,"Bought this brand new when it first came out in 2001 when my daughter was born so we had space to change baby diapers in the back and was safe for the whole family. It was a fantastic new car on the scene. Well, 15 years later, my daughter is 15 now and learning to drive and she will inherit the MDX as her first car to drive around. It has 210K miles on it. Its mostly been trouble free. Transmission went at 129K so was out of any warranty. (Apparently the early models, including mine, used a GM transmission as Acura had not quiet gotten their transmission ready for the car, later models used Acura transmission). The transmission rebuild cost $4500 but included a special attachment to the radiator to resolve the heating problem that these transmission had. On this second transmission, the car is now at 210K miles and it looks like it would probably do another 20K-40K without much problems. Changed battery 4 times (we live mostly in hot climate). Changed Tires 4-5 times. Changed brakes twice. Three timing belt jobs. One 100K tune up. Countless air filter and oil changes. Leak in power steering fixed (twice). A/C hose replaced. Engine mounts replaced under warranty. Catalytic converter went at 160K miles...feel I have spend $6-7K on all the repairs and normal maintenance over the years including wear and tear items like Battery, Tire, Brakes , Wipers etc....that works out to less than $500 per year which is not bad at all. I feel part of the issue with car trouble is crooked dealers who try to get you to replace items which don't need immediate replacement. Unless its an obvious problem impacting safety and drivability don't replace the item unless you are convinced it needs replacing. Car still looks new after 15 years. Amazing paint job. And guess what, didn't like the look of the new 2014 MDX so bought a nice new Range Rover - very fancy - but after 2 years and  numerous problems, I traded it in for an UGLY but hopefully much more reliable 2016 MDX. New 2001 MDX touring bought for $37K in California in 2001. New 2016 MDX Base model bought for $39K in Texas in 2016...which was $5K off the MSRP due to up coming model change over.

I'm not the type of person who is a ""complainer"", but believe me when I tell you that Acura is having all kinds of issues with the torque converters on their transmission.
Most of the time, the issues show up right after the warranty.
The dealership (McGrath Acura) will give you the run around and have you contact the Acura Customer Care 1-800 #.
Once you do that, if you complain loud enough they will assign you to a District Manager who will do absolutely nothing to satisfy you.
If you're smart, do a simple Google Search on Acura transmission issues and see what comes up.

I was fortunate enough to find a one owner trade in with very low miles, with regular service.  I thought despite a couple of annoying short comings of the first model year, that I'd have it for years to come, but no longer. AC hose replacement at 60K miles/ $1K. Power steering 83K mi/ $600. Transmission 84K mi/ $6000. Nav system & CD multi disc changer both broken.  People still think it looks like a new car. I got several good years out of it, but for a Honda, this last year's reliability has been horrible. It should have lasted longer before the cost to repair was higher than the value. I may never go back."

Acura and dealer for something more,

dealer.  They said, ""No thanks.""

I questioned trying a first year model, 
in 2001. 

Know that replacement tranny was not 
immeidiately available when my 
repair was done Dec.'02.  Seems that 
Acura is having more wide spread

Acura extended warrany from 50,000 mi.

I got the dreaded P0740 code twice in 3 days.  The car had to go and I'm pretty sad about it.  The car has been fantastic.  Of course, I had to do regular maintenance, replace a computer module, and A/C compressor.  I would say that's pretty good for owning a car for 15 years and 204k miles.

In 2004 while still under warranty the car began making a vibrating noise. This was very intermittent and the local dealer was unable to replicate the problem. The problem has gradually gotten worse. With 77,000 miles on the car I finally discovered the transmission needed replacing. Acura ¨customer service¨ informed me I would only have to pay $1180 of the $3800 repairs. They explained that I didn't always get the car serviced at Acura. In the next sentence they said they weren't responsible for the local dealer not being able to diagnose the problem."

Best upgrade ever.  More room, comfort, visibility than the jeep.  I found the seats especially comfortable since I had a bad back.  Good handling in wet weather or snow, but would not want to take it offroad.  Has carried my family for 155K and convinced me that my next car will be the same one (not the newer smaller version).  No reliability issues, predictable maintenance.  "
acura,mdx,2001,domer1976, 02/09/2009,"Based on 90,000 miles, and 6 years of",pos,"ownership, I can honestly say I'd buy the car all over again, in a heartbeat.  Pluses are comfort, still class-leading navigation system, interior room, and build quality.  Mine has always been dealer-serviced, which hasn't been particularly cheap.  Transmission went kaput at 90,000 miles, and I neither tow, carry loads nor abuse the transmission in any way.  Would have been more disappointing, but Honda Motors - which apparently knows they have problems with this transmission, paid for half the cost of replacement.  Abundant wind and road noise and unimpressive gas mileage (about 18 mpg combined)are about the only drawbacks.  And you'd better have a wide garage door to fit it in."
acura,mdx,2001,Disgusted with Honda, 03/09/2010,Second Trans Bites the Dust,pos,"I just sold my MDX to a dealer for $4,000.00 after buying it for $24,000.00 just 5 years ago.  After two transmissions, one computer, and a couple of sensors, I must admit I am through with Honda! I bought it for reliability thinking I would get the regular 200,000+ miles experience and barely got 100,000. This would have been my second transmission in 2 years if not for selling it off. This is disgraceful for an auto manufacturer that boasts quality and charges exorbitantly for it but doesn't deliver. I basically enjoyed the car. It was reliable. I'll miss it.  But not the sorry crappy transmission problems. I hope Acura/Honda corrected this problem."
acura,mdx,2001,Great Vehicle, 04/13/2010,Great Vehicle,pos,"I now have 168,000 miles on this MDX with virtually no problems, except 1.  Two years ago, the Torque Converter went out.  The dealer indicated that it would cost about $5,000 to repair unless Acura stepped.  The dealer, Butler Acura in Ashland, Oregon contacted Acura and asked about it.  Acura agreed to replace the entire transmission and torque converter (new, not rebuilt) if I would cover the labor cost.  The car had 132,000 miles on it at the time. That is standing behind a car.  The warranty was only for 100,000 miles, but they felt it should not have gone out, so they replaced it.  The car does have a bit more road noise than I would like, but otherwise is a great performer!"
acura,mdx,2001,MDX Lover, 08/27/2003,Best Mid-Size Luxury SUV on the Market,pos,"I have owned my MDX for just over two
years now logging 39,000 miles.  Before
I purchased it, I looked at all the
mid-size luxury SUVs available,
including BMW, Mercedes Benz, and
Lexus--I have not been disappointed in
my selection.  It's been a teriffic
vehicle--comfortable, powerful,
efficient, reliable, versatile and
stylish (conservatively so).  I have
owned Acura/Honda vehicles for more than
twenty years now and will continue to
own them as long as they continue to
offer the same performance and reliability."
acura,mdx,2001,ACURALOVER, 06/08/2004,MDX Owner,pos,"I have owned this vehicle for 3 years; 
never had a problem even once. It has 
always been a reliable trusty vehicle. 
The interior is very comfortable, and 
the third row seats are pretty roomy 
(for third-row seats). Cargo carrying 
capacity is amazing with both the 
second and third row seats folded 
flush into the floor."
acura,mdx,2001,leslie ingle, 11/01/2010,Acura MDX 2001,pos,"Purchased used from a dealer with app 40k miles on it.  Was great for a couple of years and then at 95k, I had to have the transmission replaced.  Acura did replace because of recall and I only paid a $400 labor charge.  Very disappointed that now at 145k miles I am hearing the same noise and know it is again the transmission.  I will never by another Honda or Acura.  I have owned Toyotas previously and never had any major problems.  Going back to Toyota but in the meantime I feel stuck with this car.  Can't sell it with a faulty transmission and do not want to pay for new one.  "
acura,mdx,2001,alabamafamily, 03/23/2009,195K and still going strong,pos,"This is the best car I've ever owned. I'll roll 200,000 miles sometime this summer, yet this car has NEVER let me down.  The only time it's ever been in the shop was for air conditioning problems.  Even then it was a minor fix.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone considering it!"
acura,mdx,2001,amc, 09/16/2008,"I was a big fan until 80,000 miles",pos,"I bought this car from another dealership and was instantly thrilled with this car.  However, I am appalled that after hitting 78000 miles, the car started mild rpm surging and am also being told I need a torque converter.  I was impressed with another write up that I had the same experience, lots of $ to diagnose the problem.  Interior plastic buttons for lights and vents, broke apart. Same experience as others.  I have never replaced a transmission on a car in my entire life.  This is so discouraging."
acura,mdx,2001,Acura enthusiast, 08/03/2002,Best SUV Available,pos,"I shopped the RX300 and X5 along with 
the MDX (excluded the ML320 because of 
reported reliability horrors).  For the 
price, the other two couldn't compare.  
Although I heard stories about price-
gouging and rude dealer behavior, my 
experience at Jeffrey Acura in 
Roseville, Michigan was perfect.  Since 
obtaining it, I have gone on several 
road trips, endured two winters, and 
moved to a new state.  The MDX 
performed perfectly in all conditions 
and can really haul a load of stuff!  
This is my 7th Acura, but not my last."
acura,mdx,2001,dec, 08/05/2002,MDXcellant,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 30,0000 miles 
and 23 months. I am completely 
satisfied with my decision to purchase 
it. I disagree with Pete, above. I 
think the interior is simple and 
elegant. There is nothing ""cheap"" about 
it. The workmanship is equal the Lexus 
and better than the German competition."
acura,mdx,2001,Cav Man, 12/11/2002,Don't believe me go for a Test Drive,pos,"Go drive them all Envoy, Pathfinder, 
Explorer,etc and then drive a MDX.  
After you drive the MDX you will 
say ""why did I waste all that time"". A 
great vehicle that speaks for itself--
power,looks, room & fuel economy."
acura,mdx,2001,al's mdx , 01/04/2003,Great Vehicle Lousy Service,pos,"Vehicle excellent is spite of dealers 
lousy service and rip offs."
acura,mdx,2001,ifetayo, 07/17/2003,MDX is TIGHT,pos,"Overall performance and value for the 
price, is awesome compared to its 
competitors."
acura,mdx,2001,aylien, 08/28/2003,Don't get Black,pos,"Our car is great it has been on many 
road trips. It seems to be holding up 
well. The only complaint I have it the 
exterior dents very easily and the 
black paint scratches easily. Some 
scratches are unavoidable with black, 
but Honda black never seems to keep 
it's luster for very long. I was hoping 
they would use a better paint on the 
Acura but it is the same as our Honda. 
I have a black BMW and it does not look 
as bad as the MDX. It seems to be 
holding up in every other way. Great 
vehicle!  "
acura,mdx,2001,Acurate Rating, 10/01/2003,SUV for Smart buyers not for name seeker,pos,"This is a vehicle for someone who 
cares about the quality (and by 
quality I mean the Consumer Reports, 
the reliability, the high resale, the 
inexspensive replacement parts, the 
excellent highway safety reviews) of a 
vehicle and not the logo on the hood.  
If you want to impress the Joneses, 
buy a BMW or a Mercedes, but if you 
want a car that's leaps-and-bounds 
above those names, get this one."
acura,mdx,2001,Pilot 11, 10/25/2003,Great Car,pos,Best car that I have ever owned.
acura,mdx,2001,flpaindoc, 12/12/2003,Very good value,pos,"almost 20,000 miles an no problems at 
all. I have enjoy this car. "
acura,mdx,2001,Michael F. Miller, 01/08/2004,Retirement present to myself,pos,"I did a lot of research before buying 
this vehicle. I have not been 
disappointed! It is fun to drive, nice 
to look at, and the resale value ain't 
bad either. I am starting to look at 
another vehicle, a 04 MDX. I just have 
to have that back up camera! Do not 
doubt this one, buy it!"
acura,mdx,2001,Bronx Bomber, 03/04/2003,I'm Happy,pos,"The MDX rides pretty smoothly. Also has 
decent pickup. I think the handling is 
decent. Purposely drove it at a high 
rate of speed to test braking and 
maneuverability. Although lane 
change is not as smooth as in a 
car. It is a lot smoother than most 
other trucks I have driven.(Rx300,Chevy 
Blazer, Pathfinder and a Passport) Of 
course I don't recommend anyone trying 
this. One complaint. I was told 
that on hills the MDX had some sort of 
mechanism to help stop roll back. I was 
on a (not so) steep hill earlier and I 
happen to take my foot of the brake. 
Immediately the truck began to roll 
backwards down the hill. SO much for 
that anti roll back feature."
acura,mdx,2001,BCroamer, 02/04/2004,A great SUV,pos,"We've owned several different makes of 
high-end SUV's and the MDX is the 
best.  When all aspects of ownership 
are considered; price, size, 
performance, comfort, resale, etc, the 
only thing that comes close is the 
Lexus LX470 and it's cost is 
considerable higher.  

The NAV system is the best, we travel 
extensively and wouldn't be without it.

We've had it off-road and while not a 
true ""rock-hopper"" it does very well.  
In the snow & ice it really shines.

We're very pleased with our purchase."
acura,mdx,2001,Lino, 02/16/2004,Excellent,pos,"I purchased this vehicle from Carmax 
and it has been a workhorse.  I also 
purchased the extended warranty and 
have had to use it once (engine mount & 
AC system).  I may never purchase 
another brand again!"
acura,mdx,2001,Debbie, 06/01/2006,MDX- dependable and fun,pos,"I was one of the earliest MDX buyers in our area.  I love my MDX!  It has been dependable, comfortable and low maintenance.  I put a lot of mileage on yearly and have been thrilled with the vehicle!  I am now first in line for the new RDX and am anxiously awaiting its arrival!  I hope it is as good as my MDX (but with the kids grown up and out, I no longer need a 7 passenger car).  I highly recommend the MDX!"
acura,mdx,2001,Gillian, 03/09/2003,Love the MDX,pos,"I waited 4 months for my dream MDX and 
I'm pleased with it.  Minor issues--
the steering wheel radio controls have 
been repaired/replaced twice and still 
don't work right.  Not keen on the 
sheer amount of bass coming out of the 
sound system either. 

Car handles well in all weather and 
road conditions.  It's a heavy vehicle 
so it's not as nimble as some similar 
size SUVs but it's solid, stable, and 
dependable. 

Vehicle holds 7 people easily although 
the third row is not comfy for anyone 
over 5 foot.  

Overall, one of the best vehicles I've 
ever owned."
acura,mdx,2001,Ric, 07/30/2005,"wow, what a great SUV!",pos,"I've owned an SUV since way before they weere called SUVs and this Acura MDX is a thing of beauty, style and performance. The Jeep Cherokee leaked oiil after 3 years and quit running whenever it felt like it, the S-10 Blazer was ok, but was under powered and nearly roled me over when I got T- boned from someone doing about 15 MPH.  The Rodeo was about to trash it's transmission after only 55,000 miles of pampered use, blah, blah.  This MDX is peppy, stylish and rides like a dream."
acura,mdx,2001,voytekwp, 11/30/2005,Used car lemon .....,neg,"I traded my Toyota 4Runner & Land Cruiser for two MDX  (for me and my wife). What a mistake. After 50-60k I need to repair or replace: two transmissions (recall), front struts, 3 times SRS systems components, front damper springs (recall), EGR valve (recall). This 2001  MDX is a lemon and Acura Client Department is no help ."
acura,mdx,2001,Nate, 09/10/2006,Sell by 90k,pos,"We bought the MDX over the BMW X5 only because of the third row seating.  We loved the car untill 90k miles.  We have replaced two front struts $700, two motor mounts $600, SRS electronic part $520, spark plugs - Acura wanted hundreds to do them so I did the work. Timing belt and 110k service was over $1000. I am tired of the warning lights comming on every time I turn around.  Only dealer can turn them off. My miles are 90% highway on the Acura.  "
acura,mdx,2001,Richard, 03/03/2007,Awesome SUV,pos,"I purchased this vehicle with about 56000 miles a couple years ago.  I have had no issues other than a small coolant leak which was covered under warranty.  The car is smooth riding and fun to drive.  I pulled a 20 ft boat with ease, I could not even tell it was behind me. I even took it on some light 4 wheel drive excursions and it performed great. Plenty of room for 7 passengers.  Gas economy is about average on mine, clocking in at around 18 mpg. I do have a few gripes. Mirror weeps after washing vehicle causing serious water spots down the side of the car when you drive it after washing. Also, some annoying rattles which went away after purchasing new tires. Great SUV."
acura,mdx,2001,anne, 08/27/2007,Wow,pos,"I have been driving this car for a month and I can't believe the comfort, driving control. It feels like a sedan to drive and it is 2001. The touring package is fabulous and everything works perfectly after 7 years. It feels like a new car and road-holds better than the 2008 pathfinder which I also drove.  "
acura,mdx,2001,SDS828, 04/30/2003,My First SUV,pos,"Test drove and personally rated about 
a half dozen mid-sized SUVs in fall 
2000.  Selected MDX over others for 
basically 3 reasons - best/most 
useable room for hauling (make 16-20 
trips/year of 600-800 miles carrying 
lots; hauling stuff in-town), ULEV 
rating, and best value compared to 
others driven.  Perspective - previous 
car Toyota MR2!"
acura,mdx,2001,bigir, 03/13/2002,pdxmdx,pos,"Great all around performance for an SUV. Great road handling and Road Manners. 
Appointed nicely."
acura,mdx,2001,craigo, 08/13/2008,First 100k OK,pos, Have had this MDX for 7 years. Great car. The tranny has been slipping under load (hill) for a while and the dealer can not find the problem. Going in for a timing belt this week and I hope they find the tranny issue this time. Love to buy another but the $$$ is crazy.
acura,mdx,2001,Beachkid, 07/07/2009,Love it!,pos,"I bought the car the first month it was available in 2001. I now have over 167K miles on it and it's going strong. I too received a new transmission during the recall so I should have several good years left.  I love the versatility of the vehicle. From sheets of plywood to trees!  I won't buy a new one again but will consider a used one or possibly a CR-V. My husband loves his CR-V and I don't mind driving it but my MDX has just a bit more luxury about it -- if you're willing to pay the extra $$.  Might even consider a Toyota. But I've been driving either Honda's or Acura's since 1984..so it might be hard to change now.  The MDX handles very much like a car, and I've really enjoyed owning it."
acura,mdx,2001,Barb, 12/15/2009,Love it!,pos,"I've had this MDX for almost nine years (brand new with 14 miles on the engine) and have thoroughly enjoyed owning and driving this SUV. Dealer replaced the transmission about 75K miles ago.  Love the strong, stable feel when driving in snow & rain. So roomy and comfortable for trips. Even though I no longer need such a large vehicle (the kids are grown & gone now) I most likely will get another MDX only I will buy used this time. I have over 175K miles and am seeing just how long/far this car will go. Have had most of the preventive maintenance performed which can be pricey but still haven't found another SUV I like better."
acura,mdx,2001,Robin S, 06/05/2005,Saving My life,pos,"Two days ago I totaled my MDX, hitting a telephone pole head on. Fortunately thanks to a power greater than I and the structure of My MDX, I left without a scratch. I won't drive anything else. I had purchased my 2001 MDX used and loved it. Functions like a minivan, drives like a sports car and has the top of the line luxury that I love. No problems with the car @ 60 plus thousand miles. I look forward to purchasing my next one. "
acura,mdx,2001,dave, 12/02/2006,Amazing car,pos,"I bought this car used with 92,000 miles; it now has 120000 and I have had no problems with it. One of the best, most reliable, fun to drive cars on the road."

shifted from 70 MPH to second gear 
causing the car to decellerate to 55 
mph rapidly and almost cost me my 
life. I quit!!!! I have read there is 
Chrysler like Tranny probs with this 
and other Acura models. I have 100,000 
miles on mine. Theres danger in your 
future. Dealer in VA tells me it's 
common! Acura, does someone have to 
die before you recall this????????? "
acura,mdx,2001,SS, 05/03/2009,"Excellent Car, will only buy an MDX",pos,"A friend had a new 2001 MDX and loved it so I bought a pre-owned 2001 in 2005 with 44K miles.  I loved this car!  I had almost 72K miles and someone t-boned us going about 40 mph.  The car was amazing how it protected us.  The airbags went off but other than that, no damage in the interior.  Unfortunately our MDX was totaled.  We are replacing it with another MDX.  We are not even considering anything else.  In the 4 years I had the car, we have had absolutely no service calls or problems.  Love the smooth ride and security it brings while driving."
acura,mdx,2001,willyiam, 05/04/2002,Best Luxury SUV!,pos,"We have owned our MDX for about 14 
months now and driven it in all kinds 
of weather & conditions. It is a 
superior piece of engineering and 
drives beautifully. It was rated as the 
top luxury SUV by Motor Trend, Road & 
Track and Car & Driver and well 
deserved.  With the large cargo area 
and the fold up rear seats, it is the 
perfect family vehicle. Seating 
configuration changes in a matter of 
seconds. All other options are well 
thought out. We had a DVD system with 
an 8"" wide screen added which is great 
for trips.... Couldn't be happier with 
a vehicle!"
acura,mdx,2001,Alicia , 12/26/2007,Acura 2001 MDX,pos,"Bought my 2001 MDX back in 2003. Have never had any major problems with it.  I love the MDX, very sporty for the money.  Engine light came on and took it to the dealer.  It needs a new transmission.  It only has 79,000 miles on it.  I have followed all the maintenances on it, changed the oil every 3,000 miles.  Just so discouraged at this point.  Not sure how this happened. "
acura,mdx,2001,HowardB, 05/21/2002,Great partner,pos,"Collected my (wife's) MDX from Houston -
 Nav. system was perfect for my return 
to Manhattan.  Average speed something 
north of legal, fuel better than 
23MPG.  Next, we (wife, mother-in-law, 
baby, 2 cats, 12 fish and loads of 
luggage) drove to our new home in 
Houston.  Again - high speed, great 
mileage.  Since then - to Raleigh NC.  
No problems, no dramas, great ride..."
acura,mdx,2001,Car Lover, 01/16/2008,Hurrah for the MDX,pos,"Now this car is one story. The build quality is extraordinary. We got the thing used, four years strong and we still haven't needed to get it repaired. The tires get replaced soon though. The comfort is okay, the leather interior is nice, but the third row seat in the back is not made for adults! The reliability is good, too. It is there for us every time. Fuel economy is not too bad. 20 mpg average. Better than we all expected. Just be careful of that trip computer. Very fragile. Plus, for some odd reason, the radio's LCD starts blanking out in the summer. It always returns after a firm hold on it. Nice car."
acura,mdx,2001,pgweiss, 06/15/2002,My MDX,pos,"I love my MDX.
The interior is great and the ride is 
great.
One of the best features ins the 
navigation system, and of course the 
way the car looks."

acura,mdx,2001,claire1, 08/28/2002,Best Vehicle I've Owned,pos,"After 25,000 miles, I still like the 
MDX more each day. It's comfortable, 
powerful, versatile (because of the 3d 
row seats).  The handling is wonderful, 
and the controls are convenient to 
use.  It's excellent in the snow.  The 
leather is holding up well.  It's a 
perfect car for my family--we have 2 
preteen kids.  There are plenty of 
cupholders and lots of room for their 
friends.  A great car."
acura,mdx,2001,2MINPINS, 11/05/2002,Still Getting Asked How I Like It,pos,"I have owned many Honda cars and am so 
glad I returned to the Honda family.  
The solid build quality of the MDX 
makes it a comfortable pleasure to 
drive whether to and from work or on 
long trips.
The vehicle's performance many times 
lets me forget I am driving an SUV and 
not a sportscar."
acura,mdx,2001,srs, 11/08/2002,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"Couldn't be happier. This vehicle has 
been a joy to own and drive. Its 
flexibilty is wonderful. I have not had 
single problem with this SUV. I had a 
Land Rover previously and had 
numerous issues with that vehicle."
acura,mdx,2001,David O'Brien, 07/31/2002,The Perfect Vehicle,pos,"This vehicle has it all.  While it is 
technically a SUV, it handles and is as 
comfortable as a car.  I call it the 
perfect vehicle because it suits all.  
It seats 7 very comfortably without 
being too big, it has plenty of power 
with excellent gas mileage.  Plus, it 
is an Acura which will have excellent 
reliability and resale."
acura,mdx,2001,bp, 06/19/2002,buy it you will like it,pos,"Best SUV I have ever been in!  More I

like mine. HOMER"
acura,mdx,2001,Joy K, 10/13/2002,Just My Opinion,pos,"Real happy with the look and 
reliability of the MDX.  Wish it didn't 
need premium fuel.  Get lots of 
compliments on it wherever we go.  I 
think it has too much interior noise, 
but I think that got improved in 2002."
acura,mdx,2001,Michele, 02/13/2008,Will buy one all over again,pos,"My 2001 MDX is nearly 7 years old and has 180,000 miles.  Looks like new.  I don't consider the 100,000 mile tune up at $1500 a big tag item to keep this baby on the road.  Did get a new tranny during the recall a few years back and that is okay.  If I am ever in a place to need a new car, I will go for a used 2006 MDX.  But at the rate mine is going, I should be able to get another 100K out of her easy."
acura,mdx,2001,HappyinNOLA, 11/30/2002,HappyOwner,pos,"I went from an Audi convertible to the 
MDX and I am so happy that I didn't

Honda/Acura quality and I am 
constantly complimented on the style 
and luxury of the car."

Misc. accessories (cap cover for wheel, various interior lights,always needing to be replaced. Material used in interior does not wear well.  Spring is trying to protrude through seat back.   Poor transmission (been replaced once and may need another).  As much as this car costs, interior should hold up better.  This is my second Acura--may be my last."

almost 18 mpg city."
acura,mdx,2001,herzjb, 06/30/2005,Love returning to my MDX after a flight.,pos,"Love this car. I have 60,000 miles on it now. Dealer has fixed second gear under warranty via recall. Ride and performs like a car. Sturdy interior. Plenty of cargo space, cup holders and power outlets. Good entry level sound system."
acura,mdx,2001,Randall69, 02/04/2004,Dissapointed in Acura,pos,"I must have a lemon. The transmission 
had to be completely replaced after 
six months.  The brakes are extremely 
noisy and make a consistant clunking 
sound every time you shift. Acura 
claims this isn't a safety issue and I 
agree.  It is,however, annoying and 
loud and makes the vehicle sound 
cheap, which at $40,000 dollars,itis 
not. These experiences have provided a 
very disappointing experience, 
especially since this is an Acura. I 
got more reliability from an Explorer."
acura,mdx,2001,olaiz1977, 03/12/2004,Overall great SUV,pos,"There are three small details I've had 
with my MDX.
1.- Wind whistles into the cabin at 
high speeds
2.- Driver's seat is not very good for 
long roadtrips.
3.- A/C fan switch is not easy to use.
The only other comment is about its 
towing capacity. I purchased the towing 
package (which by the way, all accs. 
are very expensive) and can only tow 
about 3,000#.  If you plan to tow a 
small boat, or anything else, look for 
something else. 
Off-road is so-so.  It VTM-Lock allows 
for front wheel slip while not really 
locking the back tires.
If you dont toe and dont off-road, this 
is the best SUV you can buy"
acura,mdx,2001,Jen Tow, 06/07/2006,Perhaps the first year had more lemons,pos,"Excellent vehicle for city drivers who need a large car.  Runs smoothly and has huge carrying capacity. It is not a good 4x4.  My previous car, a jeep grand cherokee, was far superior off- road.  The Acura transmission overheated on one trip (luckily it has a light on the dash that warns you). On another the power steering failed (luckily the new steering rack was under warranty).  The huge coil spring on one of the wheels even broke going over a regular pothole.  It is rather delicate, not rugged.  But if you keep it on paved roads you will enjoy the smooth ride, quiet engine, easy to use rear seats and cargo room."
acura,mdx,2001,Yancey, 04/18/2004,Transmission Problems,pos,"I have enjoyed my MDX but I have had a 
transmission failure at 36,000 miles.  Acura 
did not cover the failure because they stated 
that I had a third party transmission cooler 
placed that voided their wonderful warranty. 
The AAMCO dealer that replace the 
transmission for $6000 told me that the 
cooler was not the problem.  I have also had 
a friend that had a transmission failure at 
$40,000 miles.  The local Acura dealer was 
not only unhelpful but downright indignant."
acura,mdx,2001,kcooper, 08/08/2006,my first real car,pos,"I say this is my first - as it really is the first good car I've gotten my hands on.   I have also owned the Jeep Cherokee FWD and the Acura is way beyond in options, handling and quality.  "
acura,mdx,2001,lbclagett, 07/21/2005,Best Luxury SUV,pos,I purchase a 2001 MDX and Love it.  It has all the features and a great price.  It is a perfect daily driver and road trip car.  It was my first of many.
acura,mdx,2001,dsippin, 03/17/2003,Best Vehicle Ever Owned,pos,"We are complaetely satified with our 
MDX. A perfect mix between luxury car 
and useful SUV. Handles great, 
extremely comfortable, and quiet. I 
think the milage is great for a vehicle 
of this size- it gets over 22 mpg 
highway. Also, we do use the Nav system 
all the time- a great system! The only 
thing I miss is that low-end punch you 
get from a V-8. Definitely not the last 
one we will buy."
acura,mdx,2001,MDX, 01/29/2006,love my mdx,pos,"My mdx has proven to be the best suv and best car I have ever owned. It handles like a small car and can turn on a dime. Great for hauling the kids to soccer practice and school. More than just roomy but comfortable too. Great CD player, six disk, with 12 speakers. Kids love to ride in the car. I had the first in our area and people were always asking about the car. Neat middle information screen, TV like. Looking forward to the 2007 model that is when I will be buying my new MDX "
acura,mdx,2001,Paul, 01/28/2007,Pretty much perfect,pos,"I wish I could be more constructive, but it is hard to think of anything wrong with this vehicle.  We were faced with the decision of buying a new, midscale SUV, or a used, upscale one like an MDX.  Boy, are we glad we bought the MDX.  If we didn't know, we'd think it was brand new.  Do the homework, and you'll find that the MDX offers the most interior room (including a 3rd row seat) in a package that is still midsized.  If you want the ability to haul kids all around town in a safe, AWD SUV, but don't want a Yukon or Expedition, then this is the rig for you.  There is no comparison to the RX 300, which is tiny compared this this (on the inside)."
acura,mdx,2001,FC, 01/27/2007,Acura Quality Questionable,pos,"Bought used 55000 and it filled up with water in first rainstorm - bad caulking on firewall seals. Broken front spring replaced. Oil jet kit installed. Tach surges 50-100 rpm every 2-3 seconds - dealer cannot diagnose after hundreds of $'s - now thinks it is torque converter. EGR valve replaced on warranty. Plastic vent controls snapped off. Rear wiper droops. Brakes cost > $600 to fix. Road noise excessive. Stereo system is weak. Fuel mileage is poor, especially in city.      "
acura,mdx,2001,RHornsby, 08/30/2007,A Fairly Solid SUV,pos,"We bought this car to replace a Dodge Caravan (yeah, I know). It is an excellent car as far as looks and overall driving goes. However, for the large price, it has had a surprising amount of problems. We have had to get multiple things fixed. It now has around 92000 miles on it, and it has broken a couple of times.   It has good acceleration with the V6, and is a solid performer (good handling, acceleration). The interior has had a few problems (seats falling apart, window motors breaking) but overall it is a roomy comfortable car. Gas mileage is okay but it has a large tank.  It is a very wide car though, feels a little sluggish after driving sedans, but is safe."
acura,mdx,2001,LUVING IT, 07/21/2007,It Drives Like A Car,pos,"I bought this truck last September with 138,000 miles. So far besides a tune up and a driver's side wheel bearing. I have had no problems with this vehicle. I moved from Connecticut to Atlanta and it drove with no problem even though it had so many miles on it."
acura,mdx,2001,Rorytug, 06/22/2003,Love It,pos,"Honda has long been known for quality 
and 2001 filled my dreams when they 
entered the SUV market in a big way.  I 
was set to purchase a Lexus 300 and am 
soo glas I had waited the estra year.  
MDX is dollar for dollar a much better 
product! The MDX is luxurious, 
comfortable, powerful and drives like a 
car with the benefits of the SUV.  It's 
disign is solid with small things like 
where the Homelink buttons are located 
set it above.  "
acura,mdx,2001,hopper2g, 06/22/2003,Excellent X,pos,"Purchased new in 2000. Nothing but 
praise for Acura and this vehicle ever 
since. Our family has really enjoyed 
the MDX. There is plenty of room for 
all passengers and their gear while 
keeping them comfortable and safe. 
Still amazed by the sheer volume of 
interior room compared to the outside 
size. We get 25 MPG on the highway and 
its ULEV."
acura,mdx,2001,miklo714, 07/01/2003,Perfect crossover SUV,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 2 years now.  
I was originally attracted to it 
because of the amazing price-feature 
ratio and the excellent test drive I 
had.  You can turn this car completely 
around in less space than just about 
all sedans.  The MDX accelerates and 
drives very smoothly - I am always out 
of stoplights way ahead of other cars 
and I'm not trying to race or 
anything, its just natural to go up to 
45 in a few seconds in this car.  "
acura,mdx,2001,Dinah, 07/08/2003,It's a Perfect 10,pos,"Long or short trips, this car is so 
comfortable, whether driving or just 
riding.  We like it so well, we are 
buying another new one."
acura,mdx,2001,Carl Lam, 03/15/2002,01 MDX Touring & Nav,pos,Solid build and performance.  I drive it pretty much like driving a sports sedan. Fuel economy is good for a vehicle this size.  HUGE interior space.  A little bit noisier than expected at this price level.  Navigation system is a delight.
acura,mdx,2001,Matt R., 03/19/2002,Very Happy after a full year!,pos,"My wife and I had narrowed it down to a MDX, a Pathfinder LE, and a 2002 Explorer Eddie Bauer/Limited. The MDX worked out to about $10k more than the others, and we're both very happy we spent the money. The SUV has LOTS of room, the third row seats work very well. We've had flawless operation since new. All in all, this isn't the best in any one area (others are faster, bigger, smaller etc), but the best combination of featers for those looking for an SUV that won't be visiting the Rubicon Trail too often!"
acura,mdx,2001,DonnyDjr, 03/25/2002,The MD-X Rules,pos,"The MD-X is by far the greatest SUV made when comparing performance, value, reliability, resale price, looks and quality. The wait is well worth it."
acura,mdx,2001,blaws, 03/28/2002,Excellent Vehicle!,pos,"This is truly an excellent vehicle.  Fit and finish are flawless.  The engine is very responsive, has plenty of power, and transfers that power to the wheels very well.  I am averaging 16-17 mpg in town, and over 23 on the highway.  The ride is somewhat firm, but without letting you feel excessively jarred or beat up.  Handling is also tight and responsive.  The Navigation package could use a little improvement.  Overall, in my opinion, Acura has a winner here."
acura,mdx,2002,grammyjan1978, 01/06/2014,LOVE LOVE LOVE this 2002 ACURA MDX TOURING,pos,"I drove this, loved the looks of it, and it has 187,000 and counting. I would buy another one just like it...got it at 54000 at dealer certified and have had no issues whatsoever. I love my Acura.
My only question...I just drove to work and for the first time I clicked the four wheel drive VDX button, how can you tell if it goes off...I clicked it and no change...got me to work in 13 inches of snow..."
acura,mdx,2002,bill_tiffany_jr, 03/07/2009,02 MDX,pos,"The MDX has been great although the 02 is well known for transmission failure. Mine gave out at 60K. There are hundreds and hundreds of similar stories, even at much lower mileage levels.  You will here a ""burr""ing sound between 40 - 50 MPH while traveling in 5th gear.  Talk to your dealer and to Acura customer service in order to get a new transmission heavily discounted or best case, for free, even when you are out of warranty."
acura,mdx,2002,davesocal, 04/19/2012,Don't be a Dummy from 3 Transmissions,pos,"Bought this MDX new with all options.
 At 55,000 had the transmission replaced using my extended warranty (1 month shy of expiration and any work done under the warranty or extension it is only good thru the end of the extension date, meaning I only had one month of warranty on the new transmission).
This transmission died at 88,000 mi.
6k replacement from the dealer, which was whittled down to 2 thousand.
 This car has been babied thru the dealer servicing since purchase.
 Service managers admit the design is faulty.
And mentioned I was lucky to get this much use before the transmissons died ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS CAR USED !!!
YOU WILL HAVE A PROBLEM !!!"
acura,mdx,2002,hdavis39, 12/29/2010,Worried after reading......,pos,"I love my MDX. I am worried now that I have read the significant issues people have had with their transmission. I pray that I will not. I have over 163,000 miles on my car now and have never had any major issues. I changed the timing belt just to avoid future problems when I did a major maintenance. I will say with regard to safety that this vehicle has been safe. I have six children and I have had several people hit me and I rear ended someone once. The only damage to my car were mere scratches. It is built like a tank. Maybe I will be one of the lucky ones but so far I cannot complain. This is the best car that I have ever driven."
acura,mdx,2002,Tom, 08/10/2010,Transmissions,pos,"Stay away from this vehicle. Buyer beware. I had my tranny replaced at the dealer after numerous issues, in fact I had to take it to a different dealer who said yes after 109KM it needs a new tranny. Now I need another 139 KM it died. I called Acura? Honda Canada only to be told too bad it is past warranty (which it is). I repeatedly told them that there have been major issues with this model and specific problem to which the reply was. No there hasn't!  Please Google 2002 acura mdx transmission issues before you make a major mistake. "
acura,mdx,2002,jbirken, 05/15/2013,Great Car!,pos,"I bought my 02 MDX new from the dealer.
I have had it now for 10 years and have over 235K miles on it.
No major repairs at all.
I read about transmissions, struts repairs, etc but I have seen none of it.
A great family car.
Very reliable.
Never failed me.
The transmission finally went recently (no complaints after 235K miles) and I want to get another one.
I do get worried from what I am reading here at times but for me the car was well worth the $$$ spent."
acura,mdx,2002,jj0103, 04/15/2010,BEWARE: Bad Transmissions,pos,Nice vehicle but not withstanding of the reputation of Honda's reliability. Transmissions have known issue under NHTSA recall 04V176000 of gear failure that could result in transmission lockup. This happened to me at 113k miles after Acura said they fixed the issue. While driving 35 mph the front end of the vehicle seized and skidded 5-7 feet. Luckily there wasn't a car behind me. They tried to charge $7k to fix the transmission. It appears there are 100's of similar cases reported online and Acura is using plausible deniability to avoid litigation issues. I logged a complaint w/ NHTSA & sold vehicle due to safety concerns. 
acura,mdx,2002,WALTER BRINEY, 05/09/2016,A little old ladies darling,pos,"I wouldn't even consider selling it accept for wanting all the new safety equipment that is now available. No issues with repairs other than scheduled maintenance. We liked it so much that we purchased a second one just like it accept it is a 2005 model.
I don't like that you must use premium fuel in it.
"
acura,mdx,2002,Elizabeth, 03/23/2010,The wonder car,pos,"Our family was in an accident on the freeway, where we lost control of the car due to slick road surface and were hit 2 times by other cars as we spun toward the fast lane.  When we took stock of each one of us in the car, we were all okay.  One of the airbags went off and the car was totaled.  The next day, we found another Acura MDX and are very glad to drive such a safe and reliable car.  We are certain many other cars would not have protected us in that situation."
acura,mdx,2002,twelborn, 11/11/2011,Very Happy With Purchase So Far,pos,"My dad and I found this 2002 Acura MDX with around 101,000 miles on it for around $12,000. Was a little off-put with the miles at first, but after I drove it I absolutely loved it. Luxury cars' engines last better than normal cars, you get a better car for the buck too. It provides smooth acceleration and provides an overall very comfortable ride. Was using unleaded-plus fuel at first, but then the ride got a little shaky. Switched back to straight-up premium and the engine performance and fuel economy became much better. I love the Bose sound system in the car, good and clean audio deliverance. Very happy with this car. As long as you do regular maintenance, you shouldn't have problems."
acura,mdx,2002,Mickey, 06/15/2008,Best mid-size suv on the market period!!,pos,"I love my MDX and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone. The styling, features, performance capabilities on this vehicle was everything I could have hoped for. Driving the MDX you feel like your in control of the road. It hugs the turns like a race car. The MDX is sporty, safe, and very roomy inside. I love my MDX!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Ken, 02/16/2010,Three transmissions!,pos,"My wife really liked the Acura's size and features. When we first got it, it certainly was smooth and quiet; much more refined than the 1996 Grand Cherokee we had before. It was a good size and she loved the touchscreen navigation. It was a little disappointing that the MDX didn't have some luxury features that the six-year old Jeep did, like automatic headlights and day/night outside mirrors. Overall she and I liked the car. The trouble started at 37000 miles when the first transmission went out. It was replaced. It broke again and was replaced at 87000 miles and we discovered this is a well-known and chronic problem with Acura's transmissions. I cannot recommend early decade MDX's."
acura,mdx,2002,JohnA.Feer, 04/16/2006,decent car...Terrible transmission,pos,"This car is a good car short term. After my second year owning this car a bunch of lights came up on the dashboard. After getting it checked, weeks later the transmission starting to fail. acura has honda products including the transmission, and honda is known for the worst transmission. The car starting bucking and did not get into gear, and would have trouble reversing. Very comfy, nice options, but just bad transmission, and sunroof."
acura,mdx,2002,David Kirchhoff, 09/21/2015,Transmission blew at 170K.,neg,"At the purchase price (could have bought a houseboat for the price), it should go 300K miles, IMHO!
Apparently Honda had trouble with the 'hydraulics' on automatic transmissions at the time they did this one. If they had not, this review would not be clouded by a transmission failure.
"
acura,mdx,2002,Tom, 01/03/2010,Buyer Beware,pos,"Tranny went at 66,000, and I am having problems again at 140,000! If not for this major issue I love it. Gas mileage OK "
acura,mdx,2002,Barry, 04/22/2010,I have better cars.,pos,"We currently have 133,000 miles. We have replaced far too many things to say this is a used car best buy. The tranny went at 99k, motor mounts at 110k, wheel bearings at 99k, shocks and struts at 115k, rear heater stopped working at 80k, it's starting to rust in the wheel wells and the list goes on. The motor mounts and tranny are a known issue on these cars. RECALL IT! Dealer said to me ""Hey, you got your use out of them"". I didn't realize parts expired.."
acura,mdx,2002,happysuver, 02/26/2002,Best SUV,pos,"The MDX handles and drives so much better than any other 7 passenger+ suv it's not even funny.

Great convenience not having to remove the seats - we can still put 3 kids in the middle row - and fold down the rear row if need be."
acura,mdx,2002,gensaco, 11/26/2006,2002 Acura MDX Touring,pos,"After owning 9 vehicles this being the 10th, I find it to be the best yet. Considering I was hell-bent on buying a hybrid suv, I'm pleasantly surprised how easily I changed my mind after taking mine for a test drive. I love it more each time I get in. Hate to get out when I get home, could drive it forever. All the interior controls are placed well for easy access. Roomy interior. The ride was a tad stiffer than an Equinox but I do love the way it handles. May be due to too much air in the tires. Great on icy roads. Nice tight turning radius. Unless they make drastic changes, I'm fairly certain I'll buy another in 3 yrs. All the bells & whistles are great. The MDX fits me like a glove."
acura,mdx,2002,no more acuras, 08/28/2010,I feel betrayed,pos,"Let me start off by saying I loved my Acuras. Had an RL that was the best i owned. It failed on me and traded for the MDX. Loved the MDX, best in class, dream car. Then the probs w the tranny started. Thank God I bought it certified. 100 mi before expiration they replaced it free, but right at 12 mos later it's crapping again. I feel like my spouse cheated on me. For something I love to cause me this much pain, I'll never buy another Acura. To fix it will cost more than I owe it. They may  have gotten better, but they lost me for good this time.  The RL was bad enough when I replaced the window motor on 3 windows and at 105k the engine died. Can you tell I'm bitter? Sorry, i don't want to be."
acura,mdx,2002,sadmatt, 08/27/2002,Honda should stick to motorcycles,neg,"What a joke.  Service, and all dealers 
just downright rude.  So you wait four 
months to find out the thing starts 
sometimes and not others.  I can see 
why Toyota is the largest and richest 
automobile producer in Japan.  This 
overpriced mini Van (what was I on when 
I bought this?) is just that.  Buy a 
RX300 and be done with it.  If you need 
to haul anymore than that wait for the 
new bigger Lexus.  The service and car 
is much better."
acura,mdx,2002,vegas, 02/10/2006,Disappointing,pos,This was one of the more disappointing vehicles that I have owned.  Vehicle clunks when shifting from forward to reverse (dealer says it cannot be repaired).  Can't drive with the windows down as it creates pressure inside vehicle. The list goes on.
acura,mdx,2002,bfoley80, 04/30/2012,Lemon from the factory,pos,"Bought the vehicle brand new off the lot and from day 01 the vehicle had issues, i.e. bubbles in the paint, EGR
valve recalls (numerous), etc.
The latest is the transmission.
This is the second one in 160K miles.
The first one was under warranty & the second was while still under warranty as well, however the Sunnyvale Acura dealership did not identify it and has now changed ownership & they're not taking responsibility.
The repair will be between $5K~$7K.
This is the 1st and last Acura which I will ever buy.
They use the term ""Luxury Vehicle"" - don't be fooled.
My prior Lexus was a true Luxury Vehicle, over 250K miles on the trannie w/ no issues."
acura,mdx,2002,RCTANNING, 10/07/2003,MDX Touring with NAV,pos,"We researched, and test drove them all.
The MDX on our first trip was a dream 
to drive.  The car type ride, 
performance ,luxury feel, full size, 
and egonomics sold us.
26 MPG freeway driving. I and friends 
strongly recommend it."
acura,mdx,2002,Mr Singapore, 09/04/2002,Stuck on a Hwy.. Engine Check,neg,"How can a new MDX like my just stuck on 
a Hwy.. The engine just let go while I 
am driving around 130km/hr.. The engine 
check light is on and I just got enough 
time to direct my car to the ramp.. 

This is not fun and a major safty 
issue.. I WON'T buy ANY ACURA anymore !

The roadside assistance and dealership 
services is nothing compare to Infinit 
provide.."
acura,mdx,2002,Norick Baboomian, 05/16/2002,noisy noisy,pos,"Its a ok suv to have, couldn't wait to 
buy it. But for a $45k suv I could buy 
a quieter suv. Lots of wind and road 
noise. The armrest is not comfortble 
while driving. Should have waited 
another year so I can get an improved 
2002 model. Acura doesn't take the 
responsibility to upgrade it, so I am 
not happy with their service. One of 
the victims of a first year production 
car buyr."
acura,mdx,2002,Maneesh N Patel, 06/22/2002,Serious Raders only,neg,"This brand new SUV has been to garage 
twice.Very poor service.They drove the

to fight for it.Rude staff.
DO NOT EVEN THINK OF THIS ACURA>"
acura,mdx,2002,Jerry D. Gibbens, 07/03/2002,Wind noise is ATROCIOUS,pos,"My 2001 MDX has been a DISASTER from
the second week.  I get TERRIFIC
wind noise at speeds in access of
60 miles per hours.  The dealership
smiles and works on the MDX, but they
wind noise continues.  I have had
the RUN AROUND from the Acura
National folks.  I would DEFINETELY
NOT buy another ACURA."
acura,mdx,2002,Puma, 08/18/2002,Good quality built in North America???,pos,"The car is well biult but a few inches 
too high.  Sunroof too small for this 
size of a car (much smaller than 
competiotion). Lumbar support very 
primitive, not effective."
acura,mdx,2002,JYMDX, 11/04/2003,Too many unexplained noises,pos,"I like the MDX, like the way it looks, 
like the gas mileage (but not the 
required premium gas).  The only 
complaint I have so far is the noise 
the brakes make (which we're told is 
normal) and little rattles that appear 
out of no where. It sounds like it's 
metal hitting metal somewhere in the 
second row seats.  The slighest bump in 
the road brings on the rattle.  The 
dealership was unable to find 
anything.  Currently I have an old 
towel rolled up between the seat the 
metal piece that it locks onto.  So far 
this week, I haven't heard the noise 
again.  If I don't get rid of this 
noise, the car will have to go because 
it drives me nuts!"
acura,mdx,2002,mikelevels, 05/23/2006,Hope This Helps,pos,"I did a lot of research before buying this car. I got the list down to MDX and Pilot, the Honda version of the same car, because I carry large speakers and needed a 49"" wide car. There were no used Pilots at the time, so the MDX was it. Like everyone else, I had the transmission problem and eventually had it replaced under warrantee with no questions asked. Make sure you buy a certified car with an extended power train warrantee. Great highway cruiser. 4 hour trips are no problem. If it got stolen, I'd get a Pilot to replace it. "

acura,mdx,2002,megabuck2, 04/10/2002,188 MDX,pos,"Had a chance for a long drive from the 
SF area to L.A and comfort and 
driveability was excellent. Engine was 
strong in passing as well as climbing 
the ""Grapevine"". 
The seats were comfortable during the 
6+ hours of driving. HVAC was set and 
forgotten and kept the cabin nice a 
cool, navigation system helped to find 
my hotel. Bose system, I enjoyed it 
immensely during the trip. However, it 
seems the radio was weak in getting and 
holding onto radio signals. The road 
noise was kept to minimum but the wind 
noise was annoying. It was not ""LOUD"" 
but loud enough force me to turn the 
volume up on the stereo to enjoy Eric

days time. I test drove atleast 4 times 
on highways and local roads.  I also 
tried Lexus RX300 and did'nt like it. 
MDX matched all my requirements!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,BoosHound, 04/11/2002,Excellence,pos,"Acura has outdone themselves!  The 
recent (and moderate) design changes 
clearly state that Acura has made a 
superior SUV with little room for 
improvement!"
acura,mdx,2002,RocinRob, 04/12/2002,Pure excellence,pos,"I have to say, buying my New Acura MDX 
was a smart decision. I paid more than 
sticker and I would do it again. This 
SUV drives like a car, handles rough 
roads in NYC with ease and dosen't toss 
me around like the competition does."
acura,mdx,2002,Mad in Big D, 07/16/2008,2002 Acura MDX,neg,"I just bought an MDX. The transmission died within 30 days! 4500.00 to fix! NO MORE ACURAS for me. And, it is the SECOND time! First replacement was in 2004"

acura,mdx,2002,mattb, 09/03/2008,"Fun to Drive, but Expensive",pos,"My first time with a luxury SUV, which I researched prior to buying.  At 40K miles, the transmission needed to be replaced!!! But they did it thanks to buying it pre-owned, pre-certified - would have cost 7K.  This car handles very well and has gotten me out of more than a few accidents. Power about right and handles extremely well, is extremely comfortable."
acura,mdx,2002,GRuss, 04/27/2002,Wife's Car,pos,"For the last 15 years my wife has 
driven a couple of different SUV's and 
she says she'll stay with the MDX.  
Handles great in snow and ice. Smooth 
on the highway."

it's just so smooth and comfortable."

design, excellent driving habits, very
useful for trips and other"
acura,mdx,2002,Freddie, 11/22/2008,I Would Buy Another,pos,"My husband and I test drove several SUVs before selecting this one.  We selected it in part because it has the drive and comfort of a car unlike the truck feel of many others.  The body style is great (didn't change for a few years).  We like the reliability, overall style, navigation system, and mileage (is still very good).  After 143,000+ miles & over 7 year it still looks and drives great.  A new transmission was installed a few months before the extended warranty expired so we incurred no extra cost. No other major work has been needed. Two times the navigation malfunctioned but shortly corrected itself. We need to update our navigation CD because some locations can't be found."
acura,mdx,2002,smart guy, 05/13/2002,Smooth sailing,pos,"I purchased this vehicle after 
comparing with other SUV's.  I 
particularly liked the ride quality and 
luxure amenities vs. other SUV's I 
drove. Acura has put together a nice 
blend of funtionality and luxury."
acura,mdx,2002,MarkinOlneyMD, 05/14/2002,Sure beats my ML430!,pos,"An amazing vehicle and purchase 
process.  Very professional and well 
treated by dealership (unlike my former 
Mercedes dealer --  traded in a 2001 ML 
430, which was a piece of junk).

My wife learned all of the controls in 
no time -  very logical and well laid 
out.  The most versatile vehicles we're 
ever owned in terms of flexibility.  

The salesperson noticed a rip in the 
leather passenger seat during the 
delivery process (probably from the 
mechanic who prep'd the vehicle). 
Immediately ordered a new seat cover, 
which was no problem."
acura,mdx,2002,maxmax54, 05/14/2002,Much better than ML320,pos,"I had a Mercedes ML 320, this car is so 
far superior to that truck I cannot 
begin to think of the ways. The many 
visits to the snotty Mercedes dealer 
are a thing of the past (thank god!). 
My MDX is three months old, I had 
already been back to the Mercedes 
dealer three times with the ML 320. 
More room, better interior, quieter AC, 
no wind noise, no pieces falling off, 
no comparison!"
acura,mdx,2002,Ray 2000, 05/23/2002,Exceptional Vehicle for the money,pos,"Superb interior, fun to drive, drives 
like a car not a truck."
acura,mdx,2002,Indiana Xmom, 05/28/2002,Best 7-passenger SUV,pos,"The MDX is the perfect combination of 
reliability, versatility, and fuel 
economy, with seven-passenger 
seating.  This vehicle has all the 
advantages of an SUV, all the features 
of a minivan, and a smooth, 
comfortable ride.  It's fun to drive 
with great acceleration, and handles 
very well in all weather situations.  
We love it!"
acura,mdx,2002,JackieCar, 05/28/2002,Lifesaver!,pos,"We bought this vehicle Saturday, May 
25, Monday May 27th, a lady driving a 
2002 PT CRuiser rammed into us.  We had 
very small damage on our bumper, the PT 
Cruiser had to be towed (which gives 
you an idea of what happened to it).  
Nobody was hurt, our two small kids 
were in the 3rd row, and everybody was 
fine.  This may be a pricey vehicle but 
well worth it's price since our most 
prized possessions (our kids) were safe!"
acura,mdx,2002,paul654, 05/31/2002,Amazing SUV,pos,"Excellent vehicle drives like a 
towncar lifted up in the air. 
Excellent power and excellent sound 
system. The Navagation is the most 
accurate and easy to use, 1 disk 
covers all 50 states. Plenty of room. 
Amazing gas mileage. Nothing bad to 
say it's great, if you can get your 
hands on one. High demand and short 
supply."
acura,mdx,2002,Aaron, 06/04/2009,Mixed Bag,pos,"After looking at a ton of Suvs I finally decided to go with a 2002(55k) MDX. Everything was great with the car until strange noises started to occur. Mainly between 35-40mph. It sounded like running over rumble strips. The problems just got worse from there. Rough shifting, clunking, etc. I went and tried to find an answer for this problem and discovered that transmission problems in these vehicles are pretty common. I love this car but the transmission is a HUGE issue for me. I am very disappointed with this vehicle and I will not be buying another Acura product."
acura,mdx,2002,Landshark, 06/04/2002,Mini Van on Steroids,pos,"The wife and I got ours when our son was just a month old.  We love the mini 
van like room combined with Acura style, performance, and quality."
acura,mdx,2002,Bman, 06/05/2002,Value for your money,pos,"Traded in 98 Acura TL for extra space, 
went back to Acura for reliability & 
comfort. This thing is a dream to 
drive - good power (particularly for 
weight of vehicle), smooth 
transmission, great handling, very 
comfortable/convenient. Looks great 
inside and out - catch a lot of people 
taking notice when you drive by. Let's 
face it, SUVs aren't cheap, but you get 
your money's worth with this one."
acura,mdx,2002,oc mom, 06/06/2002,Exactly What we were looking for,pos,"My husband and I looked for over a year 
for a new vehicle that would accomadate 
an expanding family but not burden our 
limited garage space with a removeable 
3rd seat. We have very specific 
requirments; COMFORTABLE 3rd seat that 
folded into the body, enough cargo 
space for possible mid-size furniture 
purchases, great safety rating, good 
gas milage, and it had to feel like we 
weren't driving a school bus. THE MDX 
FIT ALL OF OUR REQUIRMNET AND THEN SOME!
Pick-up is great, getting on the 
freeway in Southern California is not 
longer scary. Visual is great - I can 
see my kids in the back seat as well as 
all the cars around me."
acura,mdx,2002,lokoforever, 06/07/2002,LOKO MDX,pos,"The car has exceeded all of our 
expectations--its very attractive 
inside and out, its very comfortable on 
long trips, and it performs much better 
than any other SUV we've ever driven.  
The Acura Navigation System is well 
worth the money!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Bradley Johnson, 06/11/2002,Why I Love My Acura MDX,pos,"I truly love my Acura MDX. It is the 
most invigorating vehicle to drive, 
with extreme power and comfort. I have 
driven many SUV's, but this one truly 
takes the cake. It is the most 
luxurious SUV out there, and is very 
oppulent on the interior. I cant't say 
enough about it!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Jmac, 06/14/2002,Better than my RX 300,pos,"Had an RX300 before the MDX.MDX much 
better in my opinion. Better turning 
circle, bigger front seats, quieter 
moonroof."
acura,mdx,2002,Wade Kappen, 06/14/2002,2002 Acura Mdx,pos,"I bought my Mdx from acura of orange 
park. the service was wonder ful, and i 
got a good deal. i can say that this 
car is absolutely loaded with features, 
for a good price. it is a good 
performer, highway cruiser, and city 
trasportation. It is very luxurious and 
comfy, and it completely outweighs its 
competition. This car is the best that 
i have ever owned, and i would very 
strongly reccommend it. It is an 
awesome car."
acura,mdx,2002,drhibert, 12/23/2009,3 years and still going strong,pos,"I bought my '02 MDX in '06 with 64,000 miles on it. I have not had any problems with it in the last 3 years. I keep up with regular maintenance - that's it. I can regularly get 20-22mpg around town, and up to 26 highway. Pretty good for an SUV. I'm up to 120,000 miles and it still drives and looks great. There's a weird 'pop' noise when going back into drive after being in reverse, but it's been there since I bought it and has never caused any problems. To my understanding, it is common to most '02 MDXs.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Comet, 06/18/2002,Happy with decision,pos,"I picked up the MDX on Monday and left 
for a trip on that Friday.  Extremely 
pleased with feel, ride (smooth), the 
handling and I love the navigation 
system.  My two children think it is 
great.  Quite a few admiring looks on I-
10.  So far I am very pleased."
acura,mdx,2002,jfxm, 06/27/2002,mdx,pos,"caris btter thanmeedes benz, bmw and 
toyota but needs additional 
improvemnets to make it even better as 
ided in comments below."
acura,mdx,2002,Mile High Dude, 06/30/2002,Nice Ride,pos,"I can easily hold a conversation with 
passengers while going 80 MPH, so it is 
plenty quiet.  I fly with ease through 
intersections with drainage dips, high 
crowns, and ruts, that slam others, car 
or truck.  Where others loose traction 
on rough pavement, bouncing left, and 
then right, the MDX rides through just 
fine.  Maybe that is why the others 
need the off-road low range gears :-).  
They have two hands on the wheel, 
hitting the headliner with their heads, 
while I'm honking to pass.  Nice ride 
Acura, you've tamed the SUV."
acura,mdx,2002,Mark Morrison, 07/02/2002,MDX,pos,"Absolutely excellent in every manner 
possible."
acura,mdx,2002,SDSUALUMNI, 07/03/2002,Searched Forever,pos,"Great car, look far and long for the 
right SUV...Almost settled w/ the BMW X-
5, but glad I went w/ Acura.  Saved 
$15000 and maintenence is much less 
expensive.  30000 mile service on BMW 
is $1200, EVERY 30000 miles (after your 
first 60k).  No buyers remorse 
here...Great SUV."
acura,mdx,2002,MDX Owner, 07/04/2002,Couldn't of Asked for Anything More,pos,"Great SUV!  Acura hit a home run with 
the MDX.  It has all the ammenities 
that you would want (less a DVD 
entertainment center).  Rides and 
handles like a sports sedan, quick 
acceleration, NAVI System is the best 
avail, and passenger/cargo area beats 
others hands down.  I considered BMW 
X5 (3.0) but when you add up all the 
ammenities that are found in MDX 
you're talking $50+K...with less 
room.  A trade off you will have to 
make!  Ask your dealer to chrome your 
wheels....it will make people snap 
thier heads."
acura,mdx,2002,wwong1600, 07/16/2002,Simply less money more value,pos,"Waht a great car. All the thins you 
want from an Suv and the things you 
don't want from a traditional Suv."
acura,mdx,2002,John Q, 07/20/2002,Acura for Life,pos,"This is my second Acura. My first was a 
1990 Integra that I still own with 
135,000 miles which has no rust and 
still runs like a dream. I thought of 
buying the BMW X5, but I couldn't 
resist the MDX. Maybe next time, but 
I'll always have at least one ACURA in 
my garage. ACURA FOR LIFE!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2002,RCN, 07/20/2002,Simply the best,pos,"We've owned our share of SUV's and have 
test driven about 20 and the MDX bar 
none with the exception of the BMW X5 
compares.  Value, reliability, 
roominess."
acura,mdx,2002,Simon Wu, 07/22/2002,Good car but a bit bumpy than other SUV,pos,A great value for money SUV
acura,mdx,2002,pota, 07/22/2002,mdx,pos,"good, no no, great car"
acura,mdx,2002,Not Acura, 07/31/2002,Not Buying an Acura,neg,"For sure, this vehicle is fantastic in 
terms of price, but the quality and the 
detail of this vehicle is second to the 
bottom when compare to anothers SUVs 
like (Highlander, RX300, ML3s and X5).  
Fake wood trims, unacceptable wind and 
road noise, unprofessional Acura 
salesmanship (went to 3 of them, they 
are all like that, basically Leave it 
or Take it attitude), lack of feature 
and feel of a luxury vehicle.  Though 
it is my parent's car, but I will 
definite will not consider an Acura."
acura,mdx,2002,I LOVE THIS CAR!!, 08/01/2002,Get One!!,pos,"I love my MDX!! Considered Pilot, but 
interior/exterior quality were not the 
same. No sunroof or heated seats in the 
Pilot either!  MDX does not have some 
features you'd expect for the money - 
auto/HID headlights especially, and it 
needs the touring pkg for power 
passenger seat, 6 disc CD, and without 
it roofrack is a $300 option.  Tall 
folks will have trouble finding a place 
for their left foot, and the 
transmission hunts for its gear on only 
slight upgrades.  Overall, I LOVE IT!! 
(Build more, please!)"
acura,mdx,2002,rawman, 08/05/2002,mdx to others,pos,"When I purchased my MDX, I tried all 
the other competitors cars before 
making my final decision.  The RX300, 
though quiet, was too soft and felt 
very small inside, even though outside 
it was very little different from the 
MDX. The BMW was quick, but again, 
very small inside and very stiff in 
normal driving.  The Mercedes was a 
joke.  We bought it at Hopkins Acura 
in Redwood City.  They were great.  No 
markup and no pre-accessorizing.  I 
only had to wait 4 months to get my 
car.  Can't recommend them highly 
enough."
acura,mdx,2002,Ramon, 08/10/2002,I Love My MDX,pos,"We purchased our MDX in July and are 
very pleased with the appearance and 
the comfort of the vehicle.  It handles 
the rode very well and the acceleration 
is excellent for this type of vehicle.  
We just drove our MDX from Annapolis, 
MD to Minneapolis, MN and the ride was 
a complete pleasure.  I also enjoyed 
the number of people asking us what 
kind of SUV we were driving since there 
are not many on the rode compared to 
the Lexus, BMW, and the Mercedes."
acura,mdx,2002,chad frank, 08/12/2002,The MDX is the best SUV I have ever owne,pos,"This is the best SUV I have ever 
owned.  I traded in my 2000 Jeep Grand 
Cherokee for this vehicle.  This is a 
great automobile."
acura,mdx,2002,jag69, 08/13/2002,Fun/ Comfy SUV,pos,"We've taken several long (1600 mile) 
trips in the MDX, and it is comfortable 
and flexible for us (2 Adults, 3 
Children).

Quiet, nice CD player, and easy to 
maneuver, makes it a nice machine to 
operate.  

The key fob actuated seat and mirror 
positioning memory is also very nice as 
my wife and I change off driving.

We were left with a defective battery 
on one of our extended trips.  The much 
touted ""Acura Customer Care"" was fairly 
useless in getting us into a mechanic 
for a replacement.  And it was a 
warranty item, as the cell had a 
defect.  That was frustrating.  

Otherwise, after 27000 miles, no other 
issues."
acura,mdx,2002,Padma , 08/15/2002,My first SUV,pos,"This is my first SUV. I was always 
little hesitant to drive SUVs, I am 
more of a car person. But I was totally 
impressed once I got in to the vehicle. 
And the best thing about is I am not 
missing the family minivan.. right 
after I drove off the dealership, we 
went out of town with my parents and 
two teenage children and some luggage.
No one complained abount being crammed."
acura,mdx,2002,RedMdxMemphis, 08/19/2002,Feeling Great After 9 Months,pos,"I love the MDX after 9 months.  Honda's 
magic 3rd row seat is still the best.   
For daily routine, the ride is just 
smooth as silk. The computerized 4 
wheel drive control is wonderful.  Glad 
to be in this car when it is water all 
over the place.   Honda's quality and 
drive.  we just love it..  for that 
full price, we could not get a BMW with 
7 seats (which they still don't have) 
and navigation, or Mercedez with the 
comfort of driving and convenience of 
3rd row seat.  

MDX accelerates nicely with 24HP.  I 
hardly use the gear shift beyond 4th 
and 5th.  I got used to the size and 
huge inside space.   It is a great ride 
with useful features for home. "
acura,mdx,2002,jcy, 08/19/2002,update 2002,pos,"much improved in noise reduction(I can 
tell the difference since I had owned a 
2001 MDX before I traded it in for 2002 
model) well, still not perfect, wish it 
may enlarge the trunk space 
particularly after 3rd row seat up."

acura,mdx,2002,mdxlemon, 08/22/2002,2002 Acura MDX Lemon,pos,"On delivery MDX it had a rattle which came 
from dashboard area. Took in for service 
and car was at dealer an entire month  (22 
business days). Nav system also blacking 
out intermittently. Took back to Ryan's acura 
for final repair under lemon law and rattle 
was fixed but not nav. 

I requested under lemon law that Acura give
me a new vehicle and was flat out refused. 
They feel I should bring my car back over 
and over for service while getting a loaner 
car with no nav that is worth far less and 
drive around in that.  Lemon lawsuit is being 
filed this week to bring Acura to justice for 
not complying with the lemon law.

Acura just lost this customer."
acura,mdx,2002,GN, 08/26/2002,2001 mdx,pos,"Has drivability problems:

Engine hesitates slightly when first
started, engine cold, going approx. 20 MPH

When engine is at full temp., and parked
for approx. a half an hour, it will not
start. It takes 3 to 4 tries and then
starts and runs w/o a hitch. This has
happened twice within 5 months.
11,000 miles on it.

Acura dealer cannot help.
Also DVD does not have all eastern
cities  in detail such as Naples, FL"
acura,mdx,2002,Dan Carlton, 08/26/2002,BEST SUV EVER,pos,"I Looked for over a year and love this 
car. for the money it is the best bang 
for the buck. Thanks Keyes Acura in Van 
Nuys California.. They deliver."
acura,mdx,2002,pattynjeff, 08/27/2002,Perfect for my wife,pos,"We bought this vehicle for my wife and 
are very happy.  This is a very nice 
daily driver.  Plenty of power, roomy, 
smooth ride, and handles well.  An 
exceptional value, the MDX was less 
expensive than the X5, RX300, and 
ML320."
acura,mdx,2002,drb, 08/27/2002,Good value,pos,"For the money, it is an excellent SUV.  
Others cost more and offer so much 
less.  Wind noise is horrible for 
this ""luxury"" type of vehicle.  
Hopefully honda will fix it with the 
next model year.  A pleasure to drive 
but would be better with more horse 
power."
acura,mdx,2002,Rufus, 08/26/2002,2001 Acura MDX,pos,"As a family of four, plus a dog, we 
have found the MDX to be satisfactory 
in meeting everyone's requirements.  
The towing ability more than handles 
our ski boat.  When we need extra room 
for long trips, we use a roof mounted 
carrier.  The car handles just as well 
with the carrier on top. The only 
performance drawback is the uneven 
accelaration up hills.  It seems to 
downshift frequently when faced with 
any grade of more than a minor degree."
acura,mdx,2002,grotto, 09/03/2002,Efficient but boring!,pos,"Very efficient SUV, falls short of 
being a ""Luxury"" SUV."

acura,mdx,2002,manus, 09/09/2002,Best out there,pos,"I was one of the first to own the MDX 
and never had any regrets. I once got a 
flat in a bad area and Acura Roadside 
Assistance came to the scene and 
changed my tire in less than half an 
hour! Never had any trouble with the 
car, it lives up to Acura's reputation 
of reliability. Performance is amazing 
both on and off road. I truly believe 
some of the other consumer ratings were 
posted by RX/X5/&ML owners. They paid 
thousands more for so much less, I 
don't blame them for their animosity."
acura,mdx,2002,miky, 09/10/2002,Owner,pos,"I loved this vehicle. It is fun to

acura,mdx,2002,slkman99, 09/12/2002,A NEW Acura As Good As The Acura Legend,pos,"This MDX is one of the best 
craftsmanship found on a new car today 
for under $40K. I previously owned a 
Lexus RX300 and let me tell you, the 
RX300 was a horrible car! I'm sorry, 
but its true. If you're looking for 
premium luxury at a great price, go for 
the MDX Premium. You'll love it!! By 
the way, I also own a 94 Acura Legend, 
its the best Acura since the Legend."
acura,mdx,2002,bobarags, 09/13/2002,Excellent auto,pos,"The car is very quiet although road
noise could be lessen.  The interior is
well laid out and very comfortable.  I
like the idea that the 6 CD player is
part of the radio in the dash rather
than the glove compartment or trunk."
acura,mdx,2002,PhotoMan, 09/13/2002,Best Crossover available,pos,"15,000 fantastic mile so far,  drove 
it from Massachusetts to Florida and 
back, 20 MPG average and easily 
cruises at 90+ MPH all day long.  Air 
conditioning is excellent, handling, 
comfort first rate.  It is very quite 
even at 90 MPH.  I'd recommend it to 
anyone"
acura,mdx,2002,abdiver, 09/15/2002,Best SUV in its Class,pos,"Exceeds expectations. Car is easy to drive, 
has good performance, and is versatile. 
Compare to competitors vehicles has very 
few problems for a first year car.  Reliability 
has been excellant thus far.

We looked at BMW (fun to drive but cargo 
area non existent ), Mercedes (3rd row 
seating doesn't cut it), Lexus RX 300 (nice 
but too small), and Chevrolet Tahoe 
(Reliability history). The MDX took all the 
features we wanted and liked, and 
integrated them in a seamless well 
designed, safe, and reliable vehicle."
acura,mdx,2002,Andy M, 09/16/2002,Not a Truck!,pos,"Excellent road performance, especially 
on mountain roads where it is fun!  Was 
considering the Sequoia, but the 
Sequoia drives like a (well designed) 
truck and has the interior design feel 
of a lower level vehicle.  The more I 
drive the Acura, the more pleased I 
am.  The BMW would have been nice, but 
not at the price and with one less row 
of seats.  The dealer we bought from 
was outstanding, but another we tried 
were like sharks."
acura,mdx,2002,newbie2001, 09/19/2002,Experience with my 2001 Silver MDX,pos,"Always gets a lot of glances, on and 
off the road. Several people comes up 
to me to compliment my choice of 
vehicle. Impressive vehicle, never 
regretted my purchase. Am also 
continually upgrading, just recently 
added new body side moulding to my 2001 
silver MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,Rational Buyer, 09/22/2002,A Rational Person's SUV,pos,"I drive SUVs because I need the 
interior storage space for golf 
equipment, antiques and 
garden supplies.  The Acura MDX easily 
offers the largest cargo space of any 
mid-sized SUV on the market. With the 
rear seats down, you can fit a 4 by 8 
plywood sheet flat between the wheel 
wells.  To have this in a luxury 
vehicle engineered by Acura makes this 
a no-brainer.  If you want an SUV for 
the real world, buy an MDX.  IF you 
want a rather useless hood ornament to 
impress your neighbors or prop up a low 
self image, buy an X5 or an RX300."
acura,mdx,2002,chow-chow, 09/28/2002,Accura will also be my next car,pos,"I had owned 4 american cars before, 
they gave me a lot of mechanic 
problems. Inspite of a lot bad commends 
about this MDX, I think this is the 
BEST car I ever own. I got no problems 
with the engine so far."
acura,mdx,2002,ReiverToo, 10/15/2002,I'll buy another,pos,"I love this car...er,truck...er,SUV. 
I've owned it 2 yrs & have found 
nothing that I seriously dislike & a 
whole bunch that's great. I live in the 
So.Cal. mountains & spend a lot of 
driving time on curvy, up & down roads. 
The MDX handles super. It is fun & 
stable to drive. On ice & snow the AWD 
really comes through. It has an amazing 
amount of interior space considering 
the outside appearance. The biggest 
negative with the vehicle is the dealer 
network. Having owned two MB's and two 
Lexi, I've become spoiled by excellent 
service. Acura dealerships(I've been to 
three)are about on a par with Ford. Not 
what you expect of a supposed luxury 
nameplate."
acura,mdx,2002,maxw, 10/15/2002,X5 Beatter,pos,"I have had an extrordinary experience 
with my MDX.  The ride is excellent and 
the most features are convenient. I 
have not been able to get the home link 
to work with my garage door opener, but 
otherwise it has been great.  The only 
bad thing to say is the Acura 
dealiships know they have a good car 
and are sometimes a little arrogant."
acura,mdx,2002,bjg, 10/15/2002,better than the more prestigious names,pos,"I owned and Explorer, Grand Cherokee 
and an X5 before buying this one.  It 
drives extremely well on and off road, 
provides luxury and utility in large 
doses and has a great sound system.  
There is also the added benefit of 
Acura (Honda) quality and I haven't 
even had a small rattle yet."
acura,mdx,2002,jatharp, 10/16/2002,Redrock Pearl,pos,"This is by far the best SUV I have ever 
driven. There is absolutly nothing I 
can find wrong with it."
acura,mdx,2002,first acura, 10/19/2002,Good car for the price,pos,"Did not like the look of Pilot.  Needed 7seats.  Don't want truck based SUV's 
because don't really need off road capability(just rough road cap. is fine).  
Fullsize is too bulky and cumbersome.  Volvo is expensive and has 
questionable reliability.  ===========> Acura MDX was my choice."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXowner, 11/01/2002,A Great SUV,pos,"The MDX is a capable blend of SUV, and 
family car, with a dash of sports car 
thrown in. The exterior styling is 
distinctive and elegant. It looks 
sporty and clean. The touring package 
adds nice wheels and a roof rack which 
compliments the overall styling theme. 
The interior design is on par with most 
cars in this class. It hosts a bevy of 
standard features such as leather 
trimmed seats, 8-way power driver's 
seat, and heated front seats. The 
engine is refined and strong."
acura,mdx,2002,Mct, 11/09/2002,Great SUV,pos,"Great Ride, Suprisingly good gas 
mileage, solid build quality."
acura,mdx,2002,Vance Moore, 06/05/2002,"MDX - Beat out Navigator, X-5, etc.",pos,"Excellent vehicle!  Build quality was 
well above average.  Navigation system 
simple, intuitive, comprehensive.  We 
looked at Lexus, Mercedes, Lincoln, &   
Infinity.  This was the best overall 
for handling, convenience, and fun!"
acura,mdx,2002,Jason b, 05/22/2002,MDX Review,pos,"This car is great!
The ride is
smooth, quiet, and fun
The MDX has great pick up and good 
horsepower (240)
The only bummer is that it takes 
premium gasoline but it gets good fuel 
economy 19/24"
acura,mdx,2002,imbuer, 10/12/2002,MDX is Best All-around SUV,pos,"After shopping all the others for over 
6 months, we decided on the Base MD-X 
(2002).  We almost bought an X5 4.4, 
but it is too costly and no where near 
enough room, (and the 3.0 doesn't have 
enough power). After almost a year of 
ownership, we like it even more than we 
thought we would.  Incredibly smooth 
and effortless power/torque, great gas 
mileage (up to 26 average on highway), 
pretty good handling (but not quite as 
good as X5), and plenty of room for 
hauling, tailgating, etc.  The base 
sound system is more than adequate, and 
by buying the Base MD-X instead of 
Touring, you make up some for paying 
close to MSRP."
acura,mdx,2002,TYP, 08/23/2002,X!,pos,"It's best for the price, realy
functional well designed car! I've been
follow by cops while driving 80 but they
were just checking the car out, so lucky
no ticket yet!"
acura,mdx,2002,Silvia Suttle, 10/04/2002,Acura MDX - Best Value,pos,"I compared all Mid-sized SUV's and the 
Acura MDX was the best value. I waited 
for about a year before finally 
getting the MDX and it was definately 
worth the wait. I love my car!!"
acura,mdx,2002,Scott Flood, 10/02/2002,MDXcellence,pos,"I have been driving my MDX for 2 years 
and have loved it.  This vehicle is so 
big on the inside and still fun to 
drive.  You can handle it with ease in 
a parking lot or a winding road.  
Better gas mileage than many cars.  I 
have even seen 29.5 mpg on a couple of 
highway trips.  Usually 24-25 mpg on 
hgwy.  I have had it on dirt roads and 
fire trails as well as family trips 
with golf clubs and gear for six.  This 
vehicle is great.  Bigger second row 
than Tahoe and easier to get in and out."
acura,mdx,2002,prl, 10/06/2002,Just the Best,pos,"Simply the best and not a lot of hype. 
Everything they said is true and thats 
what really counts anyway."
acura,mdx,2002,krc21756, 05/05/2002,MDX The Cross Over SUV,pos,"The wait was long (3 months) but well 
worth it.Visibility is excellant. No 
blind spots. Handling is supurb. Body 
lean is minimal as is nosedive when 
braking. The power is awesome. 240 HP 
245ft-lbs @3000 rpm. 80mph @ around 
2000rpm.0 to 60 in 8 seconds not bad 
for something that weighs 4300lbs. 16-
17 mpg city driving! This is the SUV to 
copy and manufacturers are. The 
upcoming Volvo XC-90, The Porche 
Cayenne. The Honda Pilot. Improvements 
can be made and I'm sure they're 
working on it. Quaility is what you 
would expect from a luxury vehicle 
especially when the build only 40,000 
units a year. The automotive industry 
is finally getting interesting again 
after years of stagnating."
acura,mdx,2002,MRH, 11/14/2002,Great SUV,pos,"I have used this vehicle to haul large items 
long distances on the roof;  to carry home 
improvement items and landscaping 
materials; and to carry the family 5000 miles 
on vacation.  There isn't a better, more 
reliable vehicle on the market."
acura,mdx,2002,2002 Black MDX, 11/22/2002,MDXcellent,pos,"We're very pleased with the MDX, it it 
spacious, well designed and extremely 
comfortable to drive.  The 240 hp 
engine provides excellent fuel economy 
and enough power to handle any driving 
conditions.  Can't wait to try it in 
the mountains this coming winter."
acura,mdx,2002,valandshark, 11/25/2002,2002 MDX Touring Nav,pos,"It's been a wonderful SUV.  Good 
acceleration and car-like handling.  
Lots of versitility with the third row 
seating.  The only suggestion I'd give 
Acura would be to have a bit more 
storage space behind the third seats 
(almost none when the seats are in 
use).  I test drove all of the 
competition and it blew them all away, 
and has lived up to my expectations."
acura,mdx,2002,JohnT, 12/05/2002,No complaints at all,pos,"After two years with my MDX I'm pleased 
to say that I have not had a single 
problem with this vehicle.  

It's fun to drive and has a lot of 
space.  I put two child car seats in 
the back and still easily fit an adult 
in that row.

Downside:  It's not truck-like enough 
to be ""cool"" and it's not mini-van-like 
enough to be superbly useful.  I was 
looking for a hybrid of these two 
things and while this is the best 
compromise there is, the MDX is 
not quite the best of both worlds.  

More luxurious than an Explorer, more 
spacious than an RX300, less expensive 
than a BMW, cooler (somewhat) than a 
minivan."
acura,mdx,2002,Flip MDX , 02/28/2002,Awesome,pos,"Strong acceleration, smooth ride, handles like a car, can really do above medium off roading, and only few have them"
acura,mdx,2002,tedpacificNW, 12/30/2002,MDX rules over any other SUV.,pos,"After owning a 99 Ch-eep Grand J-erokee 
for 3+ years and spending WAY TOO MUCH 
MONEY on minor and MAJOR repairs (after 
the warranty expired, of course), I 
purchased the 2002 MDX.  Although the 
price on the MDX is much more than the 
Jeep, I'll most likely be saving money 
over time.  The quality and 
craftsmanship of the MDX is by far 
superior than the JGC and I believe 90+ 
percent of all suv's on the market.  
This is the best SUV for golfers, 
because golf clubs fit like a glove in 
this SUV.  If you're looking for a 
smooth, comfortable, no-rattle, luxury 
ride, this is the SUV to buy."
acura,mdx,2002,RLJEB, 01/21/2003,noisy ride,pos,"We purchased this vehicle for the supposed 
reliability and extra seating capability.  After 
approximately 1,000 miles I began to notice 
a high pitch ringing noise when going over 
30mph.  I have taken the MDX back to the 
dealer 3 times for repair to no avail.  Also, 
whenever I change gears (i.e. go into 
reverse after being in park) the is a loud 
thud when braking.  Dealer tells me this a 
normal characterisitc of the MDX's brake 
callipers (sp?) adjusting.  Who knows?  
What I do know is that I am unhappy with the 
entire Acura experience.  I paid close to 
$40,000 for a noisy vehicle which I do not 
enjoy driving."
acura,mdx,2002,MDX Rocks, 01/22/2003,Very pleased,pos,"Just had our 7,500 mile service, and I 
can't praise this vehicle enough. Great 
power, looks, comfort, reliability. 
Having driven 330 miles through a 
serious snow storm on Christmas Eve, I 
feel qualified to say that the 4WD 
works extremely well. You can buy an X5 
with options to match the MDX for 
thousands more, and you still won't be 
able to do anything about the space 
deficit. The extra seats and cargo 
space are VERY nice to have. If you 
want to be able to say ""I drive a BMW"", 
that's understandable - my wife and I 
just bought a 530i. But if you want 
value, the MDX is the clear choice."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXer, 03/02/2002,Great vehicle,pos,"Bought it 8 months ago.  Great family hauler.  Feels and looks solid. Very comfortable inside.  Very good handling and acceleration.  Excellent crash test results by the IIHS.  NHTSA,although they have not crashed it head on, also gave it 5 stars for side impact crashing and 4 stars for rollover(most SUVs are either 3 or 2).  It comes loaded so the dealers cannot play many games with options.  We looked at the RX 300 but the MDX won hands down in terms of pricing and features."
acura,mdx,2002,ElKay, 02/08/2003,MDX,pos,"We have had our MDX for almost a year.  
We have had no problems with our 
vehicle, and have really found it to be 
better than we anticipated.  We have 
made numerous long trips and it has 
surpassed all expectations."
acura,mdx,2002,R Smith, 03/04/2002,MDX - One of the Best,pos,"There are many SUV's to choose from but if you're looking for a luxury SUV with the best list of amenities you can't do any better than the MDX.  The MDX is one of the few SUV's that offer leather heated seats, a power moon roof, rear seat a/c and heating vents/contols and a third row of seats all standard (touring edition).  It is also one of the few that ride like a car.

These cars are well worth the wait!"
acura,mdx,2002,DallasMDX, 02/22/2003,An SUV for all the right reasons!,pos,"My wife wanted a vehicle that is easy 
to manuever (not a tank!), nice 
looking, has a well appointed interior, 
will haul around our 3 kids plus junk 
and friends, and above all - is safe. 
And, she refuses to drive a van. Well, 
the MDX is the only vehicle that meets 
all the above criteria. And is does so 
with great style, and attention to 
detail."
acura,mdx,2002,Klinie Kent, 07/23/2003,Honda quality,pos,"You just can't beat Honda/Acura 
quality. We researched several SUV's 
before we purchased the MDX and it won 
hands down.  The only other SUV we 
considered was the BMW X5.  The MDX 
third row seat, not to mention about 10 
grand less, made the choice very easy. 
One other thing to look at is standard 
features.  Acura has basically no 
options, it is all standard.  That is 
where the big price difference was with 
the MDX vs. X5!!  Good luck, you won't 
go wrong with anything from Honda."
acura,mdx,2002,ArmyofTwo, 07/28/2003,Very satisfied Honda/Acura convert,pos,"I was looking for a replacement for my 
97 Explorer Limited. Tested the BMW X5 
& the Volvo XC90 both were impressive. 
The BMW had limited cargo space & the 
XC90 felt underpowerd for the weight 
and leary of 1st model year. Tried the 
MDX and found it very roomy, 
comfortable & excellent ""bang for the 
buck"". Great car with the power & 
economy balance that more than 
satisfies me. Friends & family that 
have owned Honda products swear by them 
for reliability & endurance; features 
reinforced my buying decision.  I am 
not a tree-hugger but I am pleased that 
the vehicle meets ULEV standards."
acura,mdx,2002,vranieri1, 08/04/2003,ranieri,pos,"My wife totaled her vehicle and is 
still alive due too the excellent 
safety features incorporated into this 
SUV.

If you have this vehicle consider 
yourself safe and if you want this 
vehicle consider purchasing the MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,SusanY, 08/14/2003,Excellent SUV for,pos,"This has been a fantastic vehicle for 
me and my family.  Comfortable for 
long drives as well as long commutes.  
Gas mileage is good for a large 
vehicle and reliability has been 
perfect.  We see the dealer only for 
scheduled maintenance -- and our 
dealership offers service well beyond 
what we expect every time. "
acura,mdx,2002,WifesSUV, 08/16/2003,? paint problem,pos,"I love the MDX however have had one 
disconcerting observation. The paint 
seems to chip quite easily.I have now 
noticed a paint bubble on the hood. I 
have owned nearly every make of auto 
and am somewhat concerned about the 
integrity of the finish on this 
vehicle. Futhermore, I have noticed 
this on other MDXs in parking lots. I 
found a newer MDX with a 3-4 mm rusted 
rock chip on the hood in a parking 
lot. This seems odd. I would be 
interested in getting feedback from 
other owners."
acura,mdx,2002,shortyjw, 09/08/2003,Fix the Clicking,pos,"We bought this car after driving many 
and doing our research.  Love the car, 
but hate the clicking noise the brakes 
make every time you switch gears.  
We've had it in for service and called 
Acura's customer help line.  Everyone 
says this noise is normal.  It doesn't 
sound normal- especially for a car made 
by Acura that sells for almost 
$40,000.  Dissappointed that Acura 
doesn't seem to think this is a 
problem, nor are they trying to fix it."
acura,mdx,2002,MacGyver , 08/13/2003,LOVE MY MDX,pos,"I was in the market for a SUV and had read 
positive reviews on the MDX from leading
car magazines and it was name as a Best
Buy in Consumer Reports Magazine as
well.  It drives like a car build has
the room of an SUV and handles great in
the snow!  It also has comes very nicely
equipped for a a base model so much so I
didn't see the need to spend an extra
$2500.00 on the touring package!

  "
acura,mdx,2002,PCH, 12/03/2004,Still a winner,pos,"Car delivers as promised.  There's a reason why it continued to win editors choice awards after 3 years.  Interior design is good, could be a bit more luxurious.  Gas mileage excellent under 70 MPH (23.5 MPG highway on my last trip - awesome for a mid-sized suv!).  Minor build quality issues; back of drivers seat broke off, cup holder latch needed to be replaced.  Like that they used to be rare on the road"
acura,mdx,2002,ParkerMDX, 09/29/2003,"Good SUV, crunchy brakes",pos,"Overall, this is a great vehicle. I 
noticed when it had about 6,000 miles 
that when I would come to a stop 
(mostly after it sat idle for a bit) 
that the brakes make a ""crunching"" 
noise. I took it in for it's 7500 mile 
check and it passed. I recently took 
it back in for the 15K check and 
verbalized the same concern. They 
could find nothing wrong and said that 
even some of the sedans made the same 
noise and that was typical for Acura's.
There have been no safety issues, but 
that same noise continues."
acura,mdx,2002,Gerald, 01/28/2005,Fun Car,pos,Just bought pre-owned. Very pleased with ride and Engine response. Very comfortable and love the 3rd row seat. Navagation very easy to read. Gas mileage is good for a suv. Overall no complaints.
acura,mdx,2002,jsdtbd, 10/11/2003,Great Vehicle,pos,"I have read the most recent reviews 
(from Aug 2003 to present) and I agree, 
there is a 'clunking' sound with the 
brakes when changing gears. Concerned 
me at first but realized it 
was 'normal'.  However, something 
should be done about it in future 
models.I have had no problems with 
paint-thankfully!  We did purchase this 
vehicle based on Consumer Guide.  It 
has met all of our expectations.  It is 
pricey and you will pay full sticker 
for one.  But very enjoyable to drive."
acura,mdx,2002,Carol F, 10/14/2003,2002 Acura MDX Touring,pos,"Best car I've ever owned-a joy to 
drive.  Everything seems well thought 
out.  Stability was important to me, 
because my last SUV (not an Acura) was 
so unstable I nearly lost control of 
it on the freeway when I had to make a 
quick correction.  The MDX is steady 
as a rock.  After driving it for a 
year, I am as delighted with it now as 
when I bought it. It has been problem 
free.   "
acura,mdx,2002,Derbys, 03/30/2005,Love our MDX,pos,"We live up an unpaved drive on the side of a mountain.  The MDX handles it effortlessly in all kinds of conditions.  Extremely comfortable, fun to drive, wonderful Bose audio system.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Kmac, 10/15/2003,great choice,pos,"Nearly 2 years later and I still love 
it."
acura,mdx,2002,bphill, 05/31/2005,Everything I always wanted,pos,"This vehicle truly has the best of all worlds ex.style, comfort, luxury, performance, and fuel efficient.  Not to mention that the sound system is top notch (even has a sub).  My wife and I both are very pleased all around.  The next vehicle I buy will be a newer version of the MDX.  The only thing I wish I had in this one is the navigation option.  The next one I buy will have the navigation and dvd entertainment."
acura,mdx,2002,mikedhilljr, 12/15/2003,Mike's Acura MDX Review,pos,"We are very pleased to have purchased 
the 2002 Acura MDX.  The outstanding 
exterior styling is matched with 
outstanding performance.  Not the most 
powerful engine in the world, but more 
than sufficient for its purpose.  This 
vehicle is highly recommended."
acura,mdx,2002,dboe, 02/09/2004,Ready anytime!,pos,"This is a great utility vehicle, while 
having nice style, and good comfort. 
Acceleration is brisk, and handling is 
above average for any vehicle in it's 
class. It is very stable on the road, 
at speed and/or under windy conditions.
Space utilization is great. While it 
easy to load it up, the towing 
capacity is on the small side. 
Mileage is not bad for the weight of 
vehicle. 
Brakes are just adequate. They should 
be better, this is not an easy vehicle 
to snub down from speed quickly.
Interior materials are on the cheap 
side. But so far everything seems to 
be holding up just fine. "
acura,mdx,2002,cachupin25, 03/06/2003,Honda/Acura has come a long way!,pos,"In my opinion best SUV for the price if 
compared to many European, American, 
and other Asian SUVs.  Performance is 
great, has great trailering ability, 
all though, if at the limit of the 
trailering weight, the rear suspension 
lacks strength.  Maintenance is good if 
compared to any European vehicle.  
Honda/Acura has re-engineered all their 
vehicles to add a european flavor to 
them and has also strengthened the body 
strucutre if compared Honda/Acuras 
built in the 80s."
acura,mdx,2002,Kenny a., 05/22/2006,Still Happy,pos,"I still love my MDX. the car has 95,000 miles on it and I am torn between replacing it with another or waiting to the new model comes out. I did have a few problems (transmission replaced at 35,000 miles & need a new motor mount at 90,000). But I still love the car. Acura has been wonderful auto company to deal with. "
acura,mdx,2002,rroushdy, 04/19/2004,Excellent all around,pos,"Excellent handling, fun to drive, kids 
love it very comfortable and well 
disgnd interior."
acura,mdx,2002,nbg, 05/02/2004,Not first choice but LOVE it!,pos,"This was not the vehicle that I was 
going to buy but I decided to test the 
2002 Acura MDX Touring and ended up 
with one.I grow to love this car more 
each day.This preowned came with a DVD 
player which is a godsend when taking 
trips with our two kids. I car pool to 
two different schools as well and can 
comfortably carry 5 kids and backpacks 
with no problems (ages 10-13). All 
sports gear fits (we play hockey) as 
well.Mileage: 17 city/21.5 hwy NOTE: 
Complaint to dealer re: rear brake 
noise was met with add on trim kit for 
the rear brakes. Now no noise and 
covered under warranty. "
acura,mdx,2002,RichGilb, 05/03/2004,What an AWESOME SUV!,pos,"This is an AWESOME SUV. I HIGHLY 
recommend this vehicle. It sits high 
and has wonderful traction. The wide 
wheel base makes it feel like a 
panther over bumpy terrain. In fact, 
it is surprisingly spacious inside.

It is sure-footed on any type of road 
surface or weather condition. The all-
wheel drive is one of the most 
sophisticated in the industry. Try it 
and you'll see why.

The VTEC engine is an animal! Very 
smooth, and sufficiently powerful. 
Acura reliability and performance.

The Navigation system is one of the 
best on the market. The voice is 
excellent and pleasant, and it ties 
into the stereo system seemlessly."
acura,mdx,2002,RedMDX, 05/19/2004,Very Dissapointing for $40K!,neg,"For $40K this has been a dissapointment 
to say the least...even if it cost $30K 
we'd be dissapointed....it's spent way 
too much time in the shop and there are 
still many things that the dealership 
says are normal, but they sure are 
annoying. We've had to have the entire 
VTM (4 wheel drive system) 
replaced..now the tranny is being 
recalled! 2 other minor recalls as 
well. Tires are shot at 30K! gas 
mileage at 16/18 vs. window of 
18/23...and we are easy drivers. Used 
to get 16/18 out of full sized V-8 
Chevy Tahoe and on regular gas!!"
acura,mdx,2002,unc028, 07/12/2004,Great SUV!,pos,"If you want a fun to drive, lots of cargo room or 
people room, with the capability of 4WD suv, this is 
the suv. It has so much cargo room with the second 
row seats folded down, plus it has a 3rd row in the 
back to let to more people sit. All I can say it is the 
best suv I've ever had!"
acura,mdx,2002,Pdeaun, 08/02/2004,Gettin another one as soon as I can,pos,"This is a great SUV!  It's stylishness 
turns heads.  It's roomy, I have filled 
this truck with 2 32 inch TV's (in 
their boxes) and still had room for the 
rest of the Christmas shopping bags. 
The MDX is a real workhorse.  It has 
good pick-up and is not bad on gas 
(which is getting harder and harder to 
judge)  As soon as I am ready, I will 
fly back to the dealer for a newer model"
acura,mdx,2002,B. Tierney, 09/04/2004,Acura's Best,pos,"We love our MDX - so much so that we 
will never drive any other car.  We are 
completely sold on this car.  In almost 
three years we have had absolutely no 
problems with it.  The maintenance 
schedule is reasonable and we have been 
able to keep it up with limited cost.  
This car is a winner!!!!   "
acura,mdx,2002,tfit, 10/05/2004,stuck wt. transmission woes ???,pos,"We just purchased our mdx after having 3 
odysseys.The main objective was to move into a 
high quality, performance suv. Honda was always 
great to us when service was required on our vans. 
Now the problem....our mdx is having a 1500 rpm 
transmission shutter. it has 42000 miles. By doing 
proper research I know it will need a transmission. 
it has the same transmission probems as some 
hondas( that honda will cover to 100,000 miles).So 
far acura is doing warranty to 50,000 miles.Acura is 
playing games with customers and treating 
problems case by case , as not to tarnish the acura 
image by hidding its real problems from the public."
acura,mdx,2002,KYShredder, 04/23/2005,Worth the wait,pos,"I waited 5 months for delivery, and wasn't disappointed.  It is the perfect blend of sport, utility & luxury.  Pickup is quick, handling precise yet comfortable.  I've had 7 passengers in it for short treks without complaints.  Also, I've had 4x8 sheets of drywall in it - they lie flat! It's not so luxurious that you are scared to mess it up. The wife and I fight over driving it.  It isn't as luxurious as a Lexus.  Suggested improvements are 'nits'.  With the value and performance, cannot understand why anyone would waste money on any other SUV in this class. II'd buy another!"
acura,mdx,2002,Outlaw 06, 03/18/2003,Good vehicle but not a great vehicle.,pos,"My wife drives the MDX primarily for 
shopping and shuttling around our 3 
children.  I drive it primarily on 
weekends.  Like all Hondas, the MDX 
offers good reliability and value 
(dealer price gouging 
notwithstanding).  The MDX is built 
well and has a very good engine and 
drivetrain.  The MDX's interior quality 
and ergonomics are also very good.  
However, performance is average, 
handling is unimpressive and the 
vehicle is noisy at highway speeds.  
Braking is HORRIBLE, the MDX takes 
forever to stop!  Additionally, the MDX 
is not very stylish when compared to 
other ""luxury"" SUVs such as the BMW X5 
or Mercedes-Benz M-Class (regardless of 
the price difference)."
acura,mdx,2002,bccarguy90, 07/15/2006,2002 Acura MDX Love Affair,pos,"My 2002 Acura MDX has been a flawless partner in all that I have asked of it. Aside from damage caused by accidents, there have been no problems and power has proved more than adequate. It is extremely comfortable particularly on long hauls and can carry anything from garbage to people easily. This is my top pick in the lux SUV category."
acura,mdx,2002,rgaray, 08/29/2006,BEST CAR I HAVE OWNED,pos,"I just purchased a pre-owned 2002 MDX over a month ago and to say that i am satisfied with this vehicle would be a huge understatement. This SUV drives and handles like a sedan, has the cargo space of a minivan and the ruggedness of an suv. I did a lot of research and test drove a couple of vehicles before my purchase(ML 320 being one) and am happy i made my decision to purchase the MDX."
acura,mdx,2002,D. L. May, 09/08/2006,"Surprise, Surprise!!",pos,"Bought the vehicle used with approximately 57000 miles on it.  Bought the warranty and glad I did.  Transmission had a major failure at 73000 miles.  So disappointing as my warranty is covering most of the cost of repair to replace the transmission, but not all. I told the dealership I was surprised that a high end SUV would have a major drivetrain failure with just 73000 miles.  I can't justify ever purchasing a Honda/Acura after this experience.   Advice, don't buy this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2002,Rod, 01/11/2007,Great Used Car,pos,I bought a MDX touring with nav that had 92K miles and it is great.  This SUV drives and handles well. I'm getting about 20-21 miles a gallon from driving around town and 24-25 on road trips. Never got that from my GMC Envoy.  There were some small problems since the car is 4 years old like timing belts and brakes but overall this SUV is in excellent shape. I would recommend this SUV for anyone looking for a used vehicle.
acura,mdx,2002,Linda, 03/06/2002,Love it!,pos,It's easy to see why they are being sold as quickly as they arrive on the sales floor.
acura,mdx,2002,Not too Impressed, 04/10/2003,It has it's quirks,pos,"When I bought my MDX I thought I was 
getting quality that you would expect 
with the Acura name. I have never spent 
this much on a vehicle before and had 
high expectations. There are too many 
quirks for a $40k car. 

Rattling noises from every where, 
doors, rear seats, dashboard and some 
places that I just can't figure out.  
The driver seat back squeaks if pushed 
back on slightly. After a rain or car 
wash if you roll your window down the 
inside window gets wet and must be 
wiped off. Sometimes there is this low 
ringing noise that I can't figure out 
where it's coming from. Not to mention 
the annoying brake clicking and gas 
tank sloshing. "
acura,mdx,2002,Hench, 03/06/2002,Disappointed,pos,"Waited 6 months, had to bring back at 350 & 1500 mls for noisy front end. It appears it's inherent to the X. Wind noise, tail gate slight bend and e-brake doesn't hold without extreme pressure. I'm disappointed with the build quality. It wasn't worth the wait. Make sure to take a good test drive if you can. I do love the look, the interior layout and it does cruise very nice on the highway, but at $44K delivered, knowing what I know now, I don't think I would buy again with these problems."
acura,mdx,2002,oceansix, 03/07/2002,Really nice SUV,pos,"The best vehicle that I have ever owned.  Lots of cargo space.  Good fuel mileage and range considering how powerful the engine is. Great AWD system for driving on wet or icy asphalt roads.  Excellent turning radius.  I like the ride and I find the seats to be comfortable.  Can tow up to 4,500 pounds (boat) or 3,500 pounds if any other type of trailer towed, but requires the addition of transmission and power steering fluid coolers."
acura,mdx,2002,Burbanlover, 03/08/2002,Worth the wait!,pos,"As my ""alias"" implies I drive a Suburban, while I traded my wife's '98 Discovery in for the new MDX.  Although we waited for five months, the vehicle was worth it.  It's road mannerisms are more car-like than an SUV but can accommodate more than four people (15 total when adding the Suburban's capacity).  All joking aside, as a parent, I am increasingly discouraged by sedan manufactures turning rear seats into ""buckets"" reducing their effective capacity by one."
acura,mdx,2002,hdnordhaus, 05/18/2003,A great SUV,pos,"Ride and handling for an SUV is 
excellent, more like a sedan than SUV.
Seats, driver and passenger, are the 
most comfortable of all vehicles I 
have ever been in.  Fuel economy is 
remarkable (I get better than the 
claimed 23 MPG on the highway) 
considering the power is more than 
adequate. "
acura,mdx,2002,Caroline, 05/15/2003,Love my X,pos,"I have fallen in love with a car/ suv. 
So far I have driven through 3 
snowstorms with out any fear, and 
driven to Florida twice. And, if 
someone wants to go somewhere, I 
volunteer to drive them. Handles like a 
dream, has great pickup, there is a 
great feeling of safety and control. "
acura,mdx,2002,WeTwo, 11/27/2007,Very Happy,pos,"After five years we still love this car.  It has been totally reliable, handles well, has sufficient power for freeway driving and has a surprisingly tight turning radius for its size.  Last, but not least, this MDX has extremely comfortable seating in the front and second row  (we have never used the 3rd row). We would recommend it highly. We expect ours to be carrying us around for many years to come. "
acura,mdx,2002,ladylib, 11/13/2002,Liberty loves it!,pos,"The MDX was not without inital minor 
problems (the thud, the weeping mirrors)
but both problems were resolved by 
Acura and the dealership.

Hubby was recently in a 50mph freeway 
crash in our MDX, and while our vehicle 
is pronbably totalled, he wasn't. This 
vehicle has earned it's admirably high 
safety rating - it did what it was 
designed to do and I'm grateful. Those 
foks at Acura build an awewsome egg 
crate. We're not looking elsewhere - 
we're just planning on replacing our 
damaged MDX with a  newer model. 
Thanks Acura!"
acura,mdx,2002,americare, 05/25/2003,Love our MDX,pos,"The MDX is nearly everything we 
expected it to be.  It is very roomy, 
handles well and is comfortable to 
drive.  We did however, expect better 
than 18.8 mpg  considering the MDX 
requires premium gasoline. We would 
also like to have had a rear window 
that goes down. Otherwise it is a 
terrific vehicle and an excellent value!"
acura,mdx,2002,nrstycz, 06/03/2003,AcuraMDX,pos,"I live 100 miles from my nearest Acura 
dealer. As I had hoped, I have never 
had a need for service on my MDX 
except for oil, tire rotations, and 
wiper blades. My only significant 
complaint is the wind noise from 
interstate crosswinds are magnified by 
water channels on both sides of the 
windshield."
acura,mdx,2002,suvman87, 03/12/2002,Couldn't be happier,pos,"Drives like a sedan.  Its roomy and the rear seat folds flat for lots of storage space.  Excellent fuel economy so far, averaging about 20 mpg.  Outstanding navigation system.  Easy to use.  Also very good acceleration with the 240 hp engin."
acura,mdx,2002,caroline, 05/15/2003,Love my X,pos,"I have fallen in love with a car/ suv.

acura,mdx,2002,frodo, 03/14/2002,Gret Vehicle,pos,Fun vehicle...enjoying it greatly
acura,mdx,2002,mdxking, 03/14/2002,i want another,pos,"I can't belive i waited 5 months for the vehicle, but it was worth the wait.
The standered features are unbelivable.
I never thought i would use the navigation system, but it is a lifesaver
i don't have to get out and ask for directions.(male thing) After my brother saw my vehicle he went and ordered one to. he only has to wait 3 months.(no fair) Life goes on."
acura,mdx,2002,sdf97215, 07/08/2003,Love this MDX,pos,"I have been looking for a replacement 
vehicle for my 95 Subaru Legacy for 2 
years.  Nothing turned me on til I 
tried out the Acura MDX.  It was 
comfortable for me right off the bat.  
I ended up purchasing a 8 month old 
MDX instead of a new one.  It has the 
Navigation system which is neat but 
not a requirment.  

This vehicle is a great car but does 
lack some of the luxury refinements 
that you would find in upscale 
vehicles such as the Lexus, BMW, etc.  "
acura,mdx,2002,dade, 03/17/2002,great car,pos,this car is the bbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssstttttttt
acura,mdx,2002,mdxmd, 03/17/2002,Best luxury SUV available!,pos,"Drives like a car, but like most other SUVs, it's a bit underpowered for the amount of weight it has to haul around."
acura,mdx,2002,Tiger Lady, 03/18/2002,Total Package!,pos,"My MDX is everything I had expected!  During the business week, it's perfect for taking colleagues and clients to lunch.  On the weekends, it's perfect for hauling my two large labrador retrievers, golf clubs and bicycle!  The MDX is definitely a total package."
acura,mdx,2002,thollerb, 03/24/2002,The best SUV,pos,"I never thought I would love driving a sport ute.  Fun to drive, 20 mpg gas milage, the best value for the money. If you are considering a sport ute, don't look past this one."
acura,mdx,2002,MDXOwner, 03/24/2002,Excellent SUV,pos,"Great SUV w/ loads of room, great horsepower, and tons of options!  Couldn't ask for a better SUV!"

acura,mdx,2002,J Nystrom, 03/25/2002,My Acura MDX Road Trip,pos,"Just returned from a trip to California in my new '02 MDX. Car handled extremely well, passed most other cars going over 10,000 ft Colorado passes. Extremely comfortable front and middle, a little cramped in third row. At 75 MPH, still has a lot of additional passing power, and is very solid on snow/ice. Very good visibility all around and roomy with third row seats folded down. Gas mileage on trip ranged from around 18 to 22 MPH. Extremely happy with this car."
acura,mdx,2002,WeWantMoreMPG, 03/26/2002,"Happy, but...",pos,"Overall, we're happy with the vehicle.  Our only complaint is we're averaging 16 MPG.  Its rated 17-23....Where's the love?  
Anyone else having this problem?"
acura,mdx,2002,daniel, 03/28/2002,Great,pos,Great vehicle
acura,mdx,2002,mjm, 03/28/2002,great SUV,pos,this drives like a car and has great storage space. I love the 50/50 3rd row sheet my son rides back ther and I still have room to carry stuff.
acura,mdx,2002,Wicky, 04/23/2008,Like My Acura,pos,"We just got our Acura and love it a lot. It's quick, roomy & luxurious.  The sound system is great and we really like the memory seats.   Bottom line is that this vehicle has outstanding standard options. The only additional feature I wish ours had is the ""navi.""    We've only had it about a month but thus far it rates right up there in the top 3 vehicles I've owned.  "
acura,mdx,2002,Carolina, 01/14/2017,My Favorite Vehicle,pos,"The MDX has been my favorite vehicle so far of all the Honda's I've owned. It's been realize and has met my family for over 10 years. I've barely now begun to think about updating because of the age.
"
acura,mdx,2003,andy3631, 03/23/2013,I love my MDX,pos,"I have had my Acura for about 7 years now and I absolutely love it. I bought it with 70,000 miles on it and I currently have 209,000 miles. I have never had any major problems
with it. I actually drove about 2000 miles from Chicago to California and it drove great. I hope to have it for another 200,000 miles. "
acura,mdx,2003,mvegastar, 02/22/2012,Thinking of an '03 Acura MDX? Run Away!!!!!!,neg,"My husband and I have owned a lot of different makes and models in our time, but we have had the WORST experience with our '03 Acura MDX.
We are the 2nd owner of the car, clean carfax report, bought it with 48K miles.
Owing it less than 4 yrs, not including regular maint such as oil changes, brakes and tires, we have spent over $15k on repairs!
Two transmissions, a motor, a paint job and breaking down on vacations twice to name some if it!
This car has been a nightmare and Acura could care less since we bought it used.
When reading other reviews, the transmission is clearly a problem, but has there been a recall? Nope.
I hope sharing our experience will help others avoid the same pain "
acura,mdx,2003,rquigley1, 01/15/2012,Keeps on going,pos,I was the 2nd owner. Bought in 4 years ago with 100k on the odometer. Super reliable. Changed timing belt at 140k and follow the service recommendations. I do all my own work from fluids to plugs etc. Read some posts about a tranny shift problem and noticed a little hesitation around 170k. I did a triple flush of the AT fluid and care is running just fine. I expect to get it to 200k and then buy the current body style acura. Only real problem is a hum in the stereo and loud whine in the rear dvd system after about an hour of operation. For the money- a super car. 
acura,mdx,2003,tom, 09/18/2009,Documented transmission problems,neg,"With problem after problem for my 03 MDX I thought I heard it all when local acura dealer informed me that one out of four 01-03 mdx's will need the transmission replaced!  This from a so called luxury car?  Check the web and you'll see it's true.  Don't buy this year range, cause you'll have a 25% chance of failure."
acura,mdx,2003,extremus669, 10/22/2009,"110,000 miles and still going strong",pos,"I bought my MDX in 2005 with ~62K miles on it.  It was a certified pre-owned vehicle.  I've put almost 50K additional miles on it since and the past four years have been trouble-free. Maintenance includes the occasional fluid changes (oil, VTM, transmission fluids, etc.).  The timing belt was also replaced at ~107K per the maintenance schedule.  Rides and handles great for a vehicle its size (and age)."
acura,mdx,2003,george ganem, 09/14/2006,Better than my 3 grand cherokees,pos,"I have always been pleased with owning this vehicle compared to my previous three grand cherokees. There seems to be less driver compartment room than the jeeps, but the ride is much smoother and quieter. Gas economy is better in the acura. Always felt the acura is a step up from most other suvs. Being 6'4"" tall, many other suv models are more crowded in the drivers area.  "
acura,mdx,2003,Stacy, 04/12/2018,Transmission Trouble Twice,pos,"We had a transmission rebuilt and a month after the warranty, it went out again. Mechanics say-stay away from 2003s. Other than that VERY costly repair, its a fantastic SUV.
"
acura,mdx,2003,klaire funderburgh, 09/10/2018,best car yet,pos,"bought this car with 182xxx and i’ve put 6,000 so far. owned it around 4 months and has 0 problems. drives and rides so much better than any other car we’ve had, chevy, jeep, honda and ford. i LOVE the inside and out, both are very nice looking and stay clean fairly easily. i’m a nanny and have car seats in and out of car all the time...LATCH system makes it easy to install and remove and leaves plenty of space for kiddos. nice sized suv. i live at 9000ft in conifer colorado and it does just fine on all out twisty roads even with power steering issues. seems to have descent traction on ivey roads. overall i’m in awe at acura, they really did a nice job with this one
"
acura,mdx,2003,logun, 05/18/2012,2 yr 3 month ownership (happy),pos,"Bought this SUV for my wife in late 2009 early 2010, with 74,500 miles on it.
We've put 23,000 miles on it (+ or -). We've had it dealer maintained as it was from the previous owner (we r 2nd owner). We've made sure to maintain the transmission (both frnt & rear diffs as well) as AWD or 4 x 4 vehicles require this otherwise it breaks. We have replaced shocks, struts, motor mounts, window regulator & a tensioner set.
The pwr steering does quit when we hit a large puddle till the belt dries (within a few sec.) Otherwise it's been a great vehicle. She even runs low to mid grade octane gas without issue."
acura,mdx,2003,Jon Kvernmo, 11/10/2016,Best car ever,pos,"Acura has it together.  All things considered, we would not hesitate to buy another MDX or any other Acura that fits our current needs and use parameters.
"
acura,mdx,2003,JB, 12/25/2015,TRANSMISSION,pos,"I bought this car with 43,000 miles on it in Nov 2006. Car was fantastic. When I bought the car I went for the 12 month extended warranty for an extra $1200. About 11 months into owning the car I got a check engine light and flashing D5 light. Took it to the Acura dealer. Trans DEAD!!! They replaced it for free since it was under warranty and gave me a loaner while they did it. So then about 2 years ago I notice the trans slamming into gear. Changed fluid....same crap. So October 2014 D4 blinking light and check engine light AGAIN!!! Car would not switch out 4th gear. I took it to a trans place and had the trans totally rebuilt new Valve body, PC, gears and synchros. The builder took pics of the trans it was HORRIBLE all burned up and stuff. So what Honda does is place the trans cooler into the Rad so I have no idea how but the cooling fluid got into the trans fluid probably because trans cooler in the rad and ruined the trans. So the builder added an EXTERNAL trans cooler. So now just a few days ago.....D5 blinking light. But no check engine light and car drives fine. I took the car back to the builder and he said there were no trans codes in the history or anything. I'm so done with this car. I am VERY VERY disappointed in Honda. All the Honda 5sp Autos are pure garbage and they should be ashamed of themselves. Other than the 2 trans I had to replace the car is awesome. But that trans ruins it! I cant believe Honda acting like they have no idea why this is happening. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR!!!! STAY AWAY!!! But an MDX with the new 6spd auto.
"
acura,mdx,2003,justman, 09/15/2011,Great Ride Except for Transmission,pos,"I love my MDX, but now have to to trade it in and don't want to or have $5,000 for a new one.
These SUVs are known to have transmission problems, wish I would have known that before I spent so much on it.
But, I will say, I bought mines brand new and have had it for 8 years with now major issues.
Just normally wear and tear.
Would love to get another one, but Acura still has issues with the tranny.
So, I think I'm going to go green and get a KIA Sorento.
Better gas mileage and it doesn't cost so much."
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 01/15/2010,"Love it for 160,000 miles!!!",pos,"My MDX has been great!  I have 160,000 miles and have only had to keep on maintenance schedule (although these can get a bit pricey).  I would get this car again and am actually thinking of purchasing a new MDX or RDX.  Only negative is that after 150K miles started to get a number of interior rattles - much to be expected after so much use. Speakers are excellent."
acura,mdx,2003,bmwguy, 03/03/2007,Disguised minivan,pos,"Bought a 1 year old used MDX with 14000k, drove about another 45k over 2.5 years. Roomy, mostly reliable, but NOT sporty. Closest to a minivan in ride and handling. Neither tough enough for offroad nor secure enough for sporty driving. Replaced starter under warranty, but scheduled dealer service pricey with frequent transfer case oil changes. Did I mention my dealer maintained creampuff did not hold value for a trade at an Acura dealer? Don't let Acura tell you this a a luxury car, just because it has leather seats. Mediocre stereo."
acura,mdx,2003,Dave, 03/20/2019,Best MDX ever,pos,"Too bad the newer models of the MDX are not equal to this one.  It has a few miles on it but it has held up beautifully.  Keeping it clean makes it always look new.  Performance is still great.  It is just old.  Every year we say it is time to get a new one, but the newer ones just don't compare.
"
acura,mdx,2003,renman, 12/11/2009,Cheap (really!) components,pos,"This is a great looking car IMHO.  And I love driving it, It's got a ton of room and handles nicely.  But... the quality of the internal parts... is just ridiculous.  Cheap, cheap, cheap. Vents, seat heaters, switches, etc, etc.  Parts that should last 5-6 years or longer (cuz they are just not used much) go out after 2-3 years.  A slightly better component would cost pennies, add maybe 1/2% to the total price of the car to upgrade all the little things to be reliable.  Going to think long and hard before I buy another Acura.  It's sad, because other than ALL the little things breaking, it's a great vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2003,acura 2003 mdx, 07/09/2009,Great SUV at first,pos,"Bought in March of 2003 new.  Since I bought the vehicle, I had nagging problems and at 82,000 miles I am starting to get a little worried.  I've had to replace the starter, ac compressor, vent knobs, cd player, drivers seat heater, hood struts, rear blower.  I expected more out of an Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,axelman001, 12/28/2009,2003 mdz Tranny Problems,pos,"We love the vehicle when we can keep it on the road. Bought CPO but we keep having tranny problems. Third Transmission in two years. Had same problem with our Odyssey, told problem was fixed by Honda by 2003. Wrong. Rest of car is great."
acura,mdx,2003,Post Captain, 02/16/2010,Buyer Beware,pos,"Bought this car brand new and have always maintained it properly, including the replacement of the timing belt at 105K.  Since that time it has been a money guzzling machine.  Left rear mirror fell out with motor assembly to the tune of $329.  Driver's side seat moulding broken along with loose driver's seat.  Now I've been told that the power steering is shot, a motor mount is broke, the seal around the left headlight needs to be replaced, among other things.  Total anticipated cost $3-5,000.  For all Acura says about quality, I don't know that I will buy another one."
acura,mdx,2003,stacey, 09/01/2005,disappointed,pos,"We purchased this car based on reviews of reliability and safety. Additionally, the third row seat was enticing. We have had several problems, the most serious being the brakes freezing up while driving due to a faulty sensor in the steering wheel telling the car that it was flipping and needing to stabilize! And we were 600 miles from home. Very scary and put my family at risk.  The back seat is only suitable for children. The car is noisy at high speeds.  And we get much lower gas mileage than Acura claims.  "
acura,mdx,2003,JimDee, 12/18/2005,Very satisfied,pos,"Has been an excellent vehicle. No problems in three years. Excellent highway vehicle. Mileage 22 to 24 mpg. City 16 mpg. Some road noise. Excellent service by two dealers, one in Ga and one in FL."
acura,mdx,2003,dorene1, 12/31/2002,what a great crossover vehicle!,pos,"We are so pleased with this vehicle! The acceleration is great, it's extremely quiet, and the road ride is soooo smooth. The turn radius is huge, and handling is precise. The split 3rd row gives us great flexibility of use, and we can get groceries and 3 kids in comfortably.  The DVD system is excellent, and tech features are all very useful. Solid choice for a family car."
acura,mdx,2003,gardner3, 05/22/2011,Great car!,pos,"This car overall is great! It's roomy, comfortable, smooth to drive, has power and looks good.

The sound system is nice, heated seats work well, seats fold, and I generally had no problems in long drives."
acura,mdx,2003,AGBew, 10/22/2003,MDX 2003,pos,"Best thing is the handling and when I 
first encounter rain the windsheild 
wipes went on automatically...blew me 
away. What a comfortable SUV...much 
better than my previous Durango. My 
daughter loves the DVD."
acura,mdx,2003,Skip, 04/18/2006,MDX review,pos,"Always either a Jeep or Jimmy for years.  Along with them had problems with the brakes on the Jeep's and wheel bareings on the Jimmy.  All I can say about my X is...it is nice to know, if I do not want to purchase a new auto the rest of my life, I won't have to....thank you"
acura,mdx,2003,msghana, 02/08/2007,"Smooth, reliable and luxurious",pos,This car handles beautifully. You can feel the horsepower as you adjust quickly to high speeds and it is so comfortable. This is my most favorite vehicle purchase ever!
acura,mdx,2003,posted1, 11/25/2007,Great SUV,pos,"Great vehicle. It does everything very, very well while doing almost nothing flashy. If this sounds like you, this is your SUV.  Safety is top-notch.  GPS is excellent safety / convenience feature.  Rear entertainment option is beyond value if you have kids.  Rear backup camera is now a requirement on any future vehicle after experiencing it in this MDX. This is a must.  We test-drove all competitors multiple times and this car won, hands down, in almost every measurable regard. The Lexus RX was quite nice but did not offer the convenience and functionality of this vehicle. BMW was OK at best. Infiniti was ""so-what?"". Great vehicle with minor opportunities for improvement."
acura,mdx,2003,PokerFaceJess, 09/10/2019,Powerful get up and go,pos,"There are some sensors that need to be replaced and it could use a good tune up, but this car is amazing from the power under the hood to the Bose speakers. 
"
acura,mdx,2003,bradywillin, 12/09/2019,Great but the MPG,pos,"The projected MPG is a complete lie. Driving mostly city, you'll be lucky to get 13 MPG, and around 20 highway. The luxury features have all held up; automatic windshield wipers, automatic climate control, heated seats, etc... The interior is a very comfortable place to be. You're isolated from almost all outside noise, to the point I often don't notice emergency vehicles until I see them in my mirrors. Very spacious, room for cargo even with seven passengers. Also for weighing 2.4 tons, it defiantly moves, with no struggle cruising at 100mph on the highway.
"
acura,mdx,2003,royalpar1, 09/01/2006,Wonderful SUV,pos,"I have this car now going on 4 years, no issues, the car is just great and probably the best SUV for the money. I have looked at others and believe that this the best value for money."
acura,mdx,2003,texan100, 06/16/2011,Would buy it again if not for transmission issues,pos,"I got CPO MDX after lot of research and consumerReports guide which rated MDX as the BEST suv. 

I did drive for 5 years and was very happy with my car.

I never had major issues and never paid any money from my pocket as it was all under warranty.
They did find problem with engine mounts, battery and some tubes that needed cleaning which was all taken care by Acura warranty.
I did regular maintenance. Dealer did charge me 600 or so for 60k mile service.
 Last year I did find that car was not going smooth. It was driving rough sometimes and smooth other times.
I also read about transmission issues when it hits 100k.
Since mine hit 92k I sold it."
acura,mdx,2003,RL, 04/29/2010,Transmission Problems,neg,Bought the vehicle certified and thank god I did. Three transmissions later and numerous minor fixes. Dont buy any MDX earlier than 2006 or you will be at the dealership often.
acura,mdx,2003,Jamo, 06/24/2003,Quality,pos,"Bought MDX over Highlander (second 
seats like a board) and Pilot (too much 
road noise); worth the additional 
cost.  Inside decor is excellent as is 
sound quality on Touring pkg system.  
Nav-didn't really want but now think 
it's great.  Crash ratings, stability 
system, front & side airbags, plus a 
solid, relatively quiet atmosphere give 
sense of security."
acura,mdx,2003,lilbull, 03/04/2003,Acura MDX Touring w/Entertainment,pos,"Excellent SUV for the money. Many 
things come standard. There are only a 
few options. It drives like a powerful 
car as opposed to a truck. Very 
comfortable."
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 05/06/2009,Transmission problems,pos,"I gave a poor reliability rating due to the fact that my transmission went out with only 73,000 mile on it. I can't believe that a SUV of this caliber would have this issue. Warranty ran out at 60,000 miles. Repair cost is $3,167.00. This is a regular problem with 2001 ,2002 and 2003 transmissions. "
acura,mdx,2003,Nanci, 05/23/2003,Best SUV On The Road,pos,"When I did my test drive I was so 
impressed in the way this SUV handled 
like a luxury car.  Everything a 
vehicle should have is included as 
standard.  The drive is smooth and 
quiet, the interior is comfortable and 
roomy.  Gas mileage is so-so.  Have not 
had it on the open road, all driving is 
freeway traffic and in town stop and 
go.  This vehicle is the best value for 
your money. You couldn't ask for more 
in an SUV no one can believe that cost 
of this luxury SUV"
acura,mdx,2003,Anny B, 03/08/2020,Pretty Lil Thing BUT....,pos,"I absolutely love my 03 MDX. I bought it used and the interior was immaculate and the exterior was also. It still looks brand new. But what I didn't do was research this year model. Seems that the transmissions tend to go out in them. I started having shifting problems so I looked it up and that's when I learned about the bad transmissions.  Took mine to a great tranny guy who is as honest as can be cause he could have easily said it was the transmission but he didn't.  He found a wire that had been chewed into and replaced it. Total out of my pocket, $75.00.
Every now n then it acts like it's in neutral when you give it gas but not often. Now it has motor problems. I was told several causes so I started with the most likely,  catalytic converter.  Bought brand new and replaced. Didn't fix it.  It smokes, uses oil and gas now which is something it never did before.  Nothing happened that I know of to have caused this and a compression check is on the agenda. 
To sum it up, even tho I love this vehicle, it has been a headache almost from day one. It only had about 190xxx miles on it when I bought it and when it's good it's great but that's been few and far between. Research the vehicle you're looking at, trust me, it will save you money and a headache.
"
acura,mdx,2003,Mary, 11/01/2020,Best car ever!,pos,"I loved this car, great drive, comfy and very reliable, an Acura tradition. Bpight ia 5 yrs old and 65K mi, sold it at 145K and 16 yrs old. Still in excellent condition with one exception- the transmission was going. This was unknown when I purchased it. Considered having it rebuilt, however, wanted a smaller SUV.  I have been testing BMW X3 and Acura RDX. The RDX is more reliable, the BMW lots of fun to drive. It all comes down to $$, so the RDX will be my choice. Looking for a 2011,  2012 model with low miles."
acura,mdx,2003,KauaiMDX, 07/28/2003,Blue Beauty,pos,"I really like this vehicle alot. There 
have been a few annoyances - the 
largest with the service department I 
have visited twice. This SUV is very 
comfortable to drive, has great 
heating and AC. It handles very well 
for a SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,alabama, 05/11/2003,Acura Owner in Alabama,pos,Love this vehicle.
acura,mdx,2003,GitaS, 06/17/2008,The problems are starting,pos,"Bought my MDX brand new 4 years ago. Has the most amazing and easy to use navigation system. Reliable drive. Has every feature you could need. Have had some problems though. From the start, I have had problems with starting my car (I live in sunny So. Cal). Battery has been changed twice but still doesn't always fire on the first or even second try. Now as I near 100,000 miles, things are beginning to fall apart. All the features on my steering wheel don't work (including airbag, horn, volume control, cruise cntrl). Passenger seat warmer is kaput. Vent control plastic knob fell off. SVA (or something) sensor failed. The repairs are now getting expensive. Was hoping to drive this for another 100K."
acura,mdx,2003,Maria Santos, 11/07/2002,acura suv fun to drive,pos,"this is one of the best svus I ever 
drove"
acura,mdx,2003,ECT, 11/28/2002,Fun to Drive,pos,"Great handling vehicle. It's amazing 
that the 20hp increase from the 2002 
model to the 2003 model gives so much 
more acceleration power. Workmanship 
quality is superb- not even a minor 
defect found in first 10 days."
acura,mdx,2003,dbehrens, 12/16/2002,Best vehicle ever owned,pos,"Ride and acceleration are excellent.  
The seat and driving position are very 
good.  We waited a long time and a lot 
of searching to find this vehicle.  
Nothing with seating for 7 handled or 
looked as nice as my MDX.  We are also 
thrilled with the Midnight Blue Pearl 
Exterior and Saddle enterior."
acura,mdx,2003,Franziska, 01/21/2003,First 30 days...,pos,"I have drivent the acura mdx for over 
30 days now and find it to provide me 
with a safety feeling... I am 
discouraged
with the gas mileage I have only 
averaged 16 in the city and 20 on 
highway."
acura,mdx,2003,choy, 07/14/2003,My MDX,pos,"A very confortable SUV. Lond driving 
friendly to passenger and driver."
acura,mdx,2003,cwilson336, 07/24/2003,Very Impressive,pos,"I've owned the car now for just a 
little over a week, and I still can't 
wait to drive it.  The ride is 
extremely smooth, the controls are 
right where they should be, and the 
performance is a knockout.  

I test drove the Lexus RX 330 and loved 
it, but I just couldn't pass up the 
value in a simarly equipped MDX.  My 
only request would be a better use of 
dash space.  The trip computer seems to 
be kind of silly and overkill.  "
acura,mdx,2003,mdxlover, 07/29/2003,mdx is the best suv on the planet!!!11,pos,"this is the best allround suv ever 
produced, it has refinement, comfort, 
luxury, power, a great sound system, 
four wheel drive system, and is great 
in almost every category imaginable."
acura,mdx,2003,Coolguy, 02/27/2003,The Underdog,pos,Great Car/SUV
acura,mdx,2003,matthewjoshua, 08/19/2003,A+,pos,"The MDX is excellent and fun to drive --
- very roomy and lots of cargo space.  
It is quiet and surely drives like a 
car.  Has lots of power and real easy 
to drive.  It is also fuel economy.  I 
love it's 2003 overall look.  I am so 
glad that I bought the MDX.  It's worth 
the money.  Thank you."
acura,mdx,2003,Freder Scott Bassett, 09/06/2003,MDX,pos,"Very satisfactory--thke first car in 
years that I have really been satisfied 
with (except for my 2002 Jaguar S Type)."
acura,mdx,2003,ccross4872, 09/14/2003,I Love my MDX!,pos,"This is the ultimate family car! It is 
fun for me and it is a huge hit with 
kids! There are so many standard 
features that are wonderful. It is an 
SUV that has an unbelievable smooth 
ride. It is pure luxury! "
acura,mdx,2003,TGrover, 09/19/2003,Very satisfying,pos,"Truly an all around pleasurable 
vehicle.  It works well as an executive 
commuter, but surprisingly, comfortably 
holds six more people for family 
outings.  Give it a curvey road and you 
can have a very good time, and not be 
punished by a stiff truck-like 
suspension.  But when the roads get 
slippery, the grip is very confidence 
inspiring.  Truly the best all around, 
good at everything vehicle I have ever 
driven."
acura,mdx,2003,Kevin G., 09/26/2003,Great SUV,pos,"Great SUV - would purchase again.  Some 
minor initial items were fixed by the dealer, no 
problem.  Roomy, confortable, decent styling 
- I think the reviewers who pan the styling are 
a bit off since I've checked out all the 
competition in the same league.  

This is my third Honda vehicl (first Acura) and 
I'm a devoted fan.  All  you need to do is put 
gas and regular maintenance and it will go 
forever.  Great resale value as well.  

Love it, love it, love it !!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,A. B. Garcia, 09/29/2005,Low Profile But Reliable,pos,"I've only had my Acura MDX for a month but I have enjoyed driving it.  When I was first looking for a vehicle, my choice was a certified 2004 Lexus RX 330.  My son, however, encouraged me to look at an Acura MDX.  Thus, I first test drove the Lexus, but somehow knew what to expect because I have a 1995 ES 300.  I, then humored my son and test drove an Acura.  Well, you guess what my choice was.  The Acura won hands down.   The exterior of the Acura will not catch your attention right away.  It has that low profile image.  But underneath that is the build quality, excellent appointments of the instruments on the dashboard,and of course, its reliability."
acura,mdx,2003,R. Lyman, 03/06/2003,A Winner,pos,"Works well.  Only problem is the window 
squirter has frozen up twice in one 
month:  once on the driver's side, once 
on the passenger's side.

Getting about 16 MPG around town, so 
the mileage is lower than advertised.  
Great in snow.  Like the bun warmers!"
acura,mdx,2003,Chris D, 05/11/2006,So disapponited in my MDX and Quality,neg,I bought my 2003 Acura MDX Brand new and currently it has 40k miles and in that time I have the Rotors and Brakes replaced under warr at least 4 times and all miles are highway and pampered. I have also had the truck at Acura on 4 ocassions for the Steering Wheel control because everytime I raise the volume the station changes and everytime the dealer says it was a bad ground and still can't fix it. I have opened up a complaint with Acura Corporate and bringing my truck again tonight to be fixed. All I can tell you is that I have 8 months left of my lease and I WILL NOT buy another Acura again it has been a big disappointment to spend $40000 on an SUV and deal with these constant problems
acura,mdx,2003,cheapflyfishingsob, 04/11/2003,Great Car!,pos,"Looked at the Landcruiser, GX470 and 
Sequoia.  I liked the GX because it was 
very luxurious and more of an SUV/off-
road feel, but it really had nothing on 
the MDX.  This drivetrain is awesome - 
Really quiet and effortless.  I love 
all the features and the practicality.  
The only thing the $50K cars have on 
this are wooden steering wheels and air 
shocks."
acura,mdx,2003,psaracco, 06/06/2003,MDX Rules,pos,"Very comfortable and smooth ride with a 
lot of power.  All amenities at your 
figertips."
acura,mdx,2003,ALTOBELLI, 06/18/2003,Nick,pos,"If you think a Honda product was 
soilid the Acura MDX is even better. 
It feels as if you are driving a car 
not an suv. It is just the right size, 
not like the yacht sized suv's nor 
like the micro suv's. The ride hight 
is perfect, my wife has no problem 
getting in and out."
acura,mdx,2003,gwen, 06/04/2008,Piece of junk falling apart,neg,"I bought a 2003 MDX a few months ago, a mistake. It had only a little over 60000 miles and is very poorly built. The transmission has problems. The headliner was cut too short and is falling out in the back. The rear window washer is about to fall off. And the right door has a part loose inside that makes a lot of noise when you close it. I would not buy another Acura. This company used to turn out good cars. What happened?"
acura,mdx,2003,Ron, 06/27/2008,Just an excellent vehicle!!!!,pos,"This has been a great vehicle, never had any issues with normal maintenance in 65000 miles. "
acura,mdx,2003,Keith, 08/16/2008,"80,000 Miles and Still a Great SUV",pos,"Bought it new in July 2003 for a young family of 5. Road trips, in town, on the beach, in the mountains, deep snow, icy roads, high elevations. It has performed great through all of it.  Drove it on NC's beaches on the outer banks and went right past Toyotas stuck in the sand. We now live at 8600' elev. in the Rockies and drive up and down 3000' of elevation change daily, often on unplowed roads.  This car is perfectly balanced and always stays in control.  We have had no mechanical problems.  Only issue has been the seat heater, which quit working a year ago (and very expensive to repair).  If I had to do it over again, I definitely would!"
acura,mdx,2003,Happy Family Man, 08/23/2008,All purpose family vehicle,pos,"I purchased my MDX used with 64000 miles after I got my wife and father-in-law to leave the Lexus RX300. The ride is very sporty and comfortable. The roominess paid off immediately on a family trip. The navigation screen is big and simple to use, with voice activation, and the rear entertainment system kept the kids quiet and entertained on the whole trip from Texas to South Carolina. The vehicle ran perfect with no problems, just regular oil changes and services. I feel very comfortable putting my wife and kids in this vehicle anytime. The bland exterior should not distract you from the safety and comfort and style you get for the same luxury as Lexus without the 15000 price increase. "
acura,mdx,2003,techvet, 10/03/2008,Consistent failures,neg,I purchased this MDX certified pre owned last year with 30K miles on it and have had nothing but problems with it.  I have been to the dealer 6 times in the last 12 months with various engine lights/codes and what I call the Christmas tree - all error lights go off on the dashboard.  Sometimes is fixed with loosening the gas cap but most the time has to go to the shop.  The dealer will not honor the pre owned warranty so now I am paying for repairs every few months.  I bought for brand and this was not a good idea.
acura,mdx,2003,Ivan, 01/23/2009,"Great car, poor fuel efficiency but ...",pos,"All in all, a great car. I am happy with my purchase. There's a 3rd row of seats which neatly folds down invisibly which is why I bought it.  There are a lot of automatic extras like auto headlights and wipers and rear-view mirrors that dip when reversing that make owning this car a real joy.  The MDX is also deceptively spacious and sits tall however handles well. Performance is not an issue either but fuel economy kind of is. At an average 13 MPG in the city, you'd think you were driving a GM.  Aside from fuel efficiency (or lack thereof), this is a great family vehicle that looks great even sans-family. The 3rd row is invisible when not in use and it's a Honda so you know it's reliable."
acura,mdx,2003,muymajo99, 05/02/2009,Love this car!,pos,"Purchased this car used in 2006 and have had an excellent experience.  I had had an Acura Legend earlier and had absolutely no problems.  I need to say that this car has been a dream.  I am looking forward to keeping it at least two more years.  Currently I have 84,000 miles and still love it."
acura,mdx,2003,Jon, 08/02/2009,"Good vehicle, but little problems add up",pos,"Bought used with 30K miles - all was fine for 2.5 years. Now, with only 65K miles we have had a lot of minor issues...All A/C vents have fallen off; seat molding on drivers side fell off, rain sensor doesn't work, DVD player stopped working.  Like I said, relatively minor, but very frustrating.  For a supposedly reliable, well built vehicle I'd expect more.  We only drive this about 10K miles per year and don't abuse it.  Overall, a good vehicle, reliable and roomy enough for 2 kids in car seats.  "
acura,mdx,2003,CalJuls, 09/05/2009,"Nice ride, poor quality components",pos,"Purchased our MDX with 41K on it and performance was good for about a year. The room inside is great except the third row - tight fit - the ride is nice. Serious quality issues with interior components and auto seats. Driver regulator bolt snapped in half -  cost to repl 1,500 - the finger controls for air vents snapped off - 275.00 ea to repl the vent modules - can't just repl the finger control pieces that snap off. I went to Acura based on their reputation and being a past loyal Honda driver - I am disappointed -  hv 97K miles now and getting 18 mpg - all sched main service has been followed. Being told to consider trade in by my dealer 'cause my next regular sched main will be costly - 2K."
acura,mdx,2003,Bruce, 09/12/2009,This is a great vehicle,pos,"I have owned my MDX for almost 2 years and have not had any problems. I drove it from Ohio to California and averaged 23 MPG. The seats are comfortable, the navigation system superb and the storage area large. It goes great in the Ohio winters too."
acura,mdx,2003,Max, 11/21/2009,Good SUV design; Possibly a bad year,pos,"At around 75000, my transmission went out and I've pampered this car since purchase. Luckily still under warranty at the time. Acura says this is highly unusual, though judging from other comments here not exactly so. Have had to replace air vent controls as they keep popping off. I asked Acura as often as this was happening, was this a manufacturer/material's defect or just a poor design (2-piece clip-on). I suspect both. I would expect more from Acura particularly in parts design. All in all a great SUV in general. MPG is about average for SUVs."
acura,mdx,2003,Mom Driver, 05/29/2010,Wish it would last forever!,pos,"Love my MDX and have had no major problems. My brake pads have been replaced several times, common for heavy SUVs. Vent knob spontaneously broke when I touched it a few months ago--sounds like this happens often with MDXs. Plastic trim on driver's seat has come off--also common. So far drive train and transmission work fine, but at 65K, I wonder how long that will last. Don't like style of new MDX as much! Too flashy! Want to keep this one as long as possible."
acura,mdx,2003,Acuraguy, 10/16/2002,Acura MDX The Best SUV,pos,"I like the DVD System. The 260 HP

perfect. I really enjoy driving this 
suv."

will be suprised. Get the Acura MDX. 
You don't have to take my word for it, 
go test drive the MDX."

ultimate luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,Boston Guy, 10/23/2002,2003 MDX,pos,"Excellent engine, I think its the best 
in its class. The torque band is very 
wide for a VTEC small 3.5L engine. The 
ride is quite and the handling is 
sporty. I have test drove about 10 SUV 
before I brought this Acura. I pay 
little more than I would like but I am 
very satify."
acura,mdx,2003,NYDriver, 10/28/2002,A Portable Entertainment Center,pos,"I just picked up my new 2003 MDX and 
took it on a 7 hour drive.  The 
performance and handling was superb.  
It was quite comfortable, particularly 
the seats, which felt a bit narrow at 
first, but provided great support over 
the long trip.  The entertainment 
system is great, but I think that I 
will need to go back to college to 
figure out how to work the endless 
permutations (CD-front/DVD-Rear, DVD 
front/Rear, CD Changer-front/CD Rear, 
etc.)
The vehicle provides great visibility 
and you feel comfortable at any speed."
acura,mdx,2003,JoeMDX, 10/30/2002,Not So Great MDX,neg,"This SUV has been nothing more than a 
major disappointment.  Since purchasing 
the vehicle in Septemebr, the MDX has 
been back to the dealer four times for 
electrical problems, a battery problem 
and finally a brake problem.  The 
dealer has been supportive and 
understanding but this MDX is a waste 
of money.  We may have the one bad 
apple but this should never happen."

allot of 4 wheel driving and I just 
need something to haul stuff and drive 
well in the snow.  This SUV is

acura,mdx,2003,Richard Alexander, 10/23/2002,MDX: SUV You Can Really Count On,pos,"The MDX provides great handling with 
style. The seating is very comfortable 
and adjustable.  Driving the vehicle is 
effortless as it provides excellent 
stability on and off the pavement with 
good acceleration. Because it drives 
like a sedan, I was surprised to 
discover that it is a highly capable 
off-road vehicle. For me, the MDX 
provides a perfect balance of luxury 
features, comfort and the performance 
you'd expect from an SUV. When I let my 
friends drive the MDX, it can be 
difficult to get keys back. Even if you 
don't like the idea of driving an SUV, 
you will find that driving the MDX is 
the coolest. Price-wise, it is an 
amazing value."

accelaration."

can find for my needs.. I was prooven
wrong.. The 2003 MDX have much more of
cool stuff.."
acura,mdx,2003,MSH, 11/15/2002,Love this car..er..truck,pos,"Looked at several other SUV's before 
going to the Acura dealership.  Was 
leaning heavily towards the RX300 and 
Highlander.  Once we sat in the MDX and 
drove it though, we knew that it was 
the vehicle for us.  Great room.  Third 
seat is a nice benefit, even if it's 
never used.  The engine is amazing.  
Plenty of power when you need it.  And 
the ride is more car than truck like."
acura,mdx,2003,jmreiss, 11/28/2002,jmreissmdx,pos,"outstanding suv.  the voice activated 
navigation system with the rear backup 
camera is a must.
this is the best suv for any price"
acura,mdx,2003,mellowbo, 11/30/2002,2003 Acura MDX,pos,"Ordered the 2003 6 months ago and it 
was worth the wait.  Quiet, smooth and 
fun.  Just plain makes allot of sense!"
acura,mdx,2003,frankyy, 12/01/2002,2003 MDX Touring,pos,"I have researched at least 10 SUV 
models including RX300, ML 320, ML 
320, BMW X5 and Volvo XC 90). Acura 
MDX is the best one out there. Great 
value and Acura's high quality. 
Smoother than I expected."
acura,mdx,2003,Chnc, 12/05/2002,Disappointment,pos,"There is nothing really wrong with the 
Acura but there is nothing exciting 
about it either. Kinda cheap on the 
inside and outside and the vehicle 
isn't cheap. Bought one for my wife and 
it doesn't compare to the Volvo XC90 T6 
that I bought. Price was close between 
the two but the Volvo is much nicer 
both on the inside and outside and has 
so many more safety features. A boring 
car that gets the job done but doesn't 
excite in anyway."
acura,mdx,2003,acuraman12, 12/06/2002,Great all round SUV,pos,"Everything was great about this Vehicle.
It rides and drives like an Honda/Acura 
car product.

It has great power with the 260hp 
engine. There's no problem accelerating 
with four people inside.

Note that the last 2 seats are good for 
short trips and are for kids at best.

Just one nag. The interior driver door 
handle came with a defective molding 
setting but an Acura dealer took car of 
it without no hassle.

I only give ""build Quality"" a ""9"" and 
all others 10. I used to have a '96 
Honda Accord EX and it had no problems 
up to 134,600 miles (sold it 
afterwards) so I expect this SUV to 
last."
acura,mdx,2003,frankyy, 12/08/2002,excellent SUV from Acura!,pos,"I have driven my MDX (03) for 10 days. 
It's good timing as we have had lots 
of snow and rain in past 2 weeks. MDX 
handles the snow and rain very well. 
Good performance and smooth handling. 
You don'y have to take my words here.  
But just test drive all suv's in the 
MDX class (X5/ML320/RX300 etc). You 
would like the MDX!"
acura,mdx,2003,stsweetser, 12/09/2002,My Review,pos,"I have owned the Acura MDX for one week 
and I love this vehicle.  The ride is 
smooth, the noise level is minimal and 
the style and luxury compares to my 
luxury sedan."
acura,mdx,2003,shark3716, 12/15/2002,sheer amazement,pos,"this car is amazing...we looked at 
several suvs including the new lexus, 
other lexus suvs, the volvo, the 
mercedes-benz, and the bmw...this one 
beat them all. the navigation system 
is amazing and same for the 
entertainment system. make sure to get 
the touring package."
acura,mdx,2003,Lord of the house, 12/14/2002,My new Best friend,pos,"Buying the 2003 MDX with the Rear 
entertainment system was not a total 
suprise for me. What was a suprise is 
the pleasure I get from it. It has 
more of everything I want. More room, 
more power and a great ride."
acura,mdx,2003,PDTEXAS, 12/17/2002,BEST GETS BETTER,pos,"JUST TRADED A 2OO2 TL S TYPE FOR THIS 
MDX. RIDE IS SMOOTHER AND QUIETER.
SEATS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE. NEW 
SUSPENSION CONTROLS VEHICLE WELL AT 
HIGH SPEEDS.
SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING.
WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE"

acura,mdx,2003,will4271, 12/28/2002,Go buy it now.,pos,"Test drove the MDX, RX300, Highlander, 
ML320, X5, 4Runner, Sequioa and other 
SUV. This is most accomodating for a 
family. Great power and the stops are 
short and straight."
acura,mdx,2003,vfdvddssdvsvdsfds, 01/02/2003,great car,pos,"this is definetly the best value around 
the rx cost 40k and is small and rattly 
the ml320 has poor preformance and can 
fit the most.  i love this car."
acura,mdx,2003,Hiker23, 01/03/2003,After lots of research...a happy driver,pos,"A great deal of time was spent in 
researching and comparing vehicles 
(thank you Edmunds!). During 
our ""quest"" we looked at the Toyota 
Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan 
Pathfinder, Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Lexus 
GX470.
All have great build quality but the 
value equation for the MDX was the 
best.  It represented the perfect blend 
between family hauling, luxury, 
and ""sportiness"" for us.  The 260 hp 
certainly gets it moving in a hurry 
(unsuspecting drivers are quickly 
dispatched to the rear-view mirror)but 
this is no Boxster S. Needless to say I 
expect to get atleast 10 years of 
faithful service from this great 
machine."
acura,mdx,2003,shag, 01/07/2003,I love this vehicle !!!,pos,"We had to wait 5 long months before we 
took home our beautiful MDX, but it 
was well worth the wait. Can't say 
enough great things about this SUV. It 
is so comfortable and easy to drive. 
Not to mention it is pretty classy 
looking to boot. I especially love the 
ease of raising/lowering the seats to 
fit our trunk needs."
acura,mdx,2003,owahn, 01/14/2003,Great value in luxury category,pos,"The Navigation system is simply amazing.
Space is great, we can go with friends,
8 people not a problem. It's the first 
car where I actually need to study the 
manuals though because there are just 
so many gadgets. Fuel economy is said 
to be the best, so I feel ok about it, 
although I hope car makers will still 
be able to improve on this. The only 
snag was that I had to wait 3 months
for the car."
acura,mdx,2003,theprop, 01/20/2003,perfect SUV,pos,"Powerful, strong build.  A car hit my 
MDX back bumper, MDX didn't scratch a 
bit,  the other car broke the radiator 
and damaged most of the front parts.  
14-22 mile per gal.  Nav. system is 
accurate and fun, Calculator and 
calendar feature are great."
acura,mdx,2003,MDXOVERXC90, 01/21/2003,MDXOVERXC90,pos,"The best SUV on the market for it's 
class and lots of values for your $$$$$
The car perform superb both on and off 
road include in rain and snow 
condition.
All in a 10++++++++++ Keep up the good 
work ACURA."
acura,mdx,2003,Alexandra Azevedo, 01/22/2003,I'd buy it again,pos,"It rides very good and smooth. Could 
have more room in the front, I had a 
Town and Country before so I fell a 
little tight sometimes. 3rd row is 
confortable,my 10 year old rides there 
all the time.There are lots of room 
for cargo in the back. If you consider 
an entertainment system, get it 
factory installed, I'm having a hard 
time to get one, it is difficult to 
install because of the sunroof, and 
the headrest would only fit a 4"" 
monitor, too small...Plus, there is 
not much room for a dvd player under 
the seats. My kids are disappointed! I 
enjoy driving my MDX and most of all I 
enjoy my Bose sound system!"
acura,mdx,2003,American Tim, 01/24/2003,Getcha One!,pos,"I originally hail from the Detroit 
area and my family has always bought 
vehicles made by American 
manufacturers.  After serious 
reliability problems with our 1999 Jeep 
Grand Cherokee, we decided to look at 
foreign brands.  We were pleasantly 
surprised to discover the Acura MDX.  
The build quality is far superior to 
any midsize SUV offered by GM, Ford, or 
Chrysler. And, I'm hoping Acura's 
reputation for reliability will help me 
keep the MDX on the road and out of the 
dealership's garage. The list of 
standard features is quite lengthy.  If 
you are looking for a luxury vehicle 
with a not-so-luxury price, then the 
MDX is for you!  Getcha one!"
acura,mdx,2003,HrdTsk, 01/25/2003,Acura MDX,pos,"Very Nice ride good handling with 
creature comfortxs inside and lots of 
pep to go"
acura,mdx,2003,Jed, 01/27/2003,Fun Vehicle,pos,"Decided on the MDX after driving a BMW 
330CI for 1.5 year and needed a family 
car. Father has an X5 and the MDX, I 
feel, had most of the same qualities.  
A little less power, but hey its half 
the price of the 4.4 X5.  Good car for 
the money.  Used to own a 4-Runner and 
the power of the MDX blows it away."
acura,mdx,2003,Robin & Penny, 01/28/2003,Classic Acura,pos,"Classic Acura, consertive styling, good 
(not excellent) interior materials, 
outstanding reliability!!  I checked 
out four luxury SUVs (MDX, GX 470, X5, 
XC90) and the MDX was the most versitle 
(Seating 7 and excellent performance)
and was, what I thought to be the BEST 
value.  The GX 470 was really nice but 
you had to pay an extra $9 K and the 8 
cylinder has 25 less HP. The X5 has an 
aweful relibility rating, and the XC 90 
was nice but just too small - The MDX 
Wins!!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,MyMDX, 01/30/2003,New MDX,pos,"Just picked up my new MDX.  What a 
fantastic car, comfortable seats and 
plenty of space.  Trade in my 2000 TL 
w/nav, this car is even more 
comfortable on the highway!"
acura,mdx,2003,steve_seattle, 01/31/2003,The X rocks,pos,"I have been very pleased with the MDX. I traded in my M3, because of the kids and skiing. I thought I would really miss it, but the MDX is great. A great car in the snow and, for such a large car, it is very fun to drive. I would recomend it to anyone in the SUV market. Plus the 6 hr drive to the mountains is realatively painless with the DVD system!"
acura,mdx,2003,vinnie, 01/31/2003,excellent vehicle,pos,"SLAM DUNK FOR 
ACURA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2003,buttons, 02/01/2003,A excellent SUV,pos,"Spent a year testing SUV's. I finally 
had to decide between the new Lexus 
GX470 and the MDX. I choose the MDX 
because although the Lexus had a 
larger engine I couldn't justify the 
additional $12,000. Had to wait 6 
weeks for delivery, but I'm not 
dissapointed."
acura,mdx,2003,Jerry Randolph, 02/04/2003,Brother to purchaser,pos,"Having driven with my sister in her 
newly purchased 2002 MDX, the 
solidness, the control of the steering 
mechanism, the voluntary movement of 
the inner controls of the car taking 
turns, curves, up and dowwnhill 
movements were excellent."
acura,mdx,2003,Laurena , 02/05/2003,Hands down the best SUV on the market!,pos,"After having tested out the 
BMW,VOLVO,TOYOTA,ACURA,INFINITI,LEXUS,H
ONDA,AND MITSUBISHI.I found myself 
with only one vehicle that not only 
caught the emotional side of me,but 
also the important practical, and 
family oriented side. Basically to 
make a long story short I spent 2 
months learning everythng humanly 
possilbe about everyone of these 
vehicles, and the Acura MDX by far 
took the lead.Once I purchased the 
vehicle I was reminded of the 0 
scheduled maintenence for 105k miles, 
and 7,500 miles for every oil change.  
To anyone reading you MUST,and I mean 
MUST look into the Acura MDX before 
you purchase an SUV."
acura,mdx,2003,Plateau KD, 02/09/2003,"Excellent, driving machine !",pos,"Before I buy MDX, I took test drive 
othe Suv's like, Mercedes ML, BMW MX, 
Toyota LC.
This was the best car I've ever driven.
It's fast, stable, yet I can still feel 
like a sport car. Eye catching design 
on the road too."
acura,mdx,2003,popejohn, 02/10/2003,2003 Base Model in Sagebrush,pos,"Have had the car for almost two months 
now.  Very satisfied with the looks, 
ride, and quality.  Car actually has 
more power and driving comfort than I 
expected.  I have to remind myself I am 
driving an SUV and not go too fast into 
curves - it really feels like driving a 
much smaller vehicle.  Really like the 
Sagebrush color - looks very dark at 
night, but looks almost grey in 
sunlight.  Gets decent gas mileage - 
17.5 mpg in mostly city driving."
acura,mdx,2003,goodsofar, 02/19/2003,great to date,pos,"Have had my MDX for two weeks and so 
far it's great.  Drove 4Runner, M350, 
MDX and was headed to BMW but never got 
there.  Had a Tahoe previously and the 
MDX handles better, has a more carlike 
ride, better standard features, and was 
less to purchase.  Gave a 9 on exterior 
design only because side door moldings 
are an add on.  Alittle concerned with 
possible door dings in parking lots. 
This SUV has delivered style, ride, 
efficiency, safety, and comfort at a 
very affordable price.  The 5 star 
safety rating is a plus.  I drive a car 
for a long time and I'm hopeful this 
vehicle will deliver many years of 
maintenance free miles."
acura,mdx,2003,mista, 02/22/2003,Best SUV - MDX,pos,"Bought for my wife, I drive a RL. Most 
surprised by car like feel and ride. If 
this Acura product is as good as the 
others I have owned, then we will have 
this for a long time.

Handling is the best of all SUV that I 
have been in (MB-320,Expedition,Yukon 
and Jeep)."
acura,mdx,2003,Gena, 06/10/2003,Chose MDX over Lexus GX470,pos,"I chose the MDX over the Lexus GX470 
for the price, gas mileage, drive and 
options.  The MDX has plenty of 
options.  It handles very well, has an 
awesome sound system, a great 
navigation system, and plenty of room--
the middle row fits three car seats (I 
have three little ones) and there's 
still plenty of room in the back for 
strollers, groceries, and other items 
with the third row folded down.  It 
accelerates very well/quickly for an 
SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2003,Dr.Mo, 06/10/2003,worth the wait,pos,"fun to drive. Sharp style which is 
distinctive. Very comfortable. I put my 
deposit down and took 3 months to look 
at the competition. It was a no 
brainer. Much nicer than the Lexus 
which was too feminine(sorry ladies, 
but my wife agrees). Navigation system 
is awsome!!"
acura,mdx,2003,BuddyP, 07/14/2003,Fine SUV,pos,"Overall very happy. Just passed 4000 
miles in 6 weeks. Excellent build 
quality, quiet and generally 
comfortable. Underpowered compared to 
American competition, especially from a 
dead stop. Gas mileage slightly less 
than EPA. "
acura,mdx,2003,vcolangelo, 07/11/2003,My 2003 MDX SS/S Navi Review,pos,"The good news is the MDX is built by 
Honda and its build quality, ride, 
quiet cabin and overall look and feel 
are well above anything experienced 
with any of my previous GM, Jeep and 
Ford SUV's .  The bad news is the MDX 
is serviced by Honda. If Honda could 
learn how to service their their luxury 
Acura line like Toyota did with Lexus, 
it would be perfect.  I love my MDX, 
but I love the service my wife gets 
with her less expensive Lexus GS more.  
Common Acura owner service complaints 
include: no free pick up and delivery 
service; no free loaner; and, no 
feeling that there's a service person 
at Acura who really takes an interest 
in your car. "
acura,mdx,2003,Rickster, 07/13/2003,Awesome Acura,pos,"My Acura MDX has been great from day one. 
The handling of the vehicle has been better 
than my Grand Cherokee. My only complaint is 
that the gas mileage could be a little better in 
the city. Highway is great."
acura,mdx,2003,flip, 07/17/2003,Perfect vehice,pos,"I live In the Seirra Foothills, the MDX 
Is just right In terms Of comfort, 
safty and well It does have the best 
looks vs BMW Toyota etc. I had a 2001 
Navi, (It was totaled)I own a 03 now. 
we were hit head on and walk away 
without any Injuries, so safe. In 
short.... an OUTSTANGING SUV period. 
Saved our life ??? "
acura,mdx,2003,LuvMyAcura, 07/24/2003,Best SUV I've ever owned,pos,"If you're considering an SUV in this

comfortable, quick acceleration, and 
stylish.  This MDX turns heads!"

only owned this car for 3 months and 
already I am having problems with 
rattling.  The engine is sometimes 
noisy as well.  I've contacted the 
dealer and they said that's just how 
this car is.  My car is too new to be 
rattling like this.  Also, the 
entertainment system doesn't seem too 
sturdy.  This SUV is not worth the high 
price!  Buyer beware!"
acura,mdx,2003,mry, 07/31/2003,New MDX,pos,"Had a Jeep for 7 years, loved the 
Cadilliac EXT, but too expensive.  
Volvo was not helpful at all and too 
expensive to wait 3 months for XC90. 
Plus didnt have the power of MDX.  
Acura of Memphis was great and they 
really sold the car on their 
personality and willing to work with me 
on the trade-in.  MDX had all the 
features I wanted and definitely moves 
when you step on the gas.  I have only 
heard good things about the Acura 
service in Memphis, and most everyone 
loves their MDX.  Felt the price was 
great for all the features we were 
getting, good crash test ratings and 
didn't have to do the 'a la carte' menu 
like Volvo or Lexus [GX or Lx series]"
acura,mdx,2003,mdx-er, 08/05/2003,Drives Like a Car,pos,"750 miles into our Touring MDX and

acura,mdx,2003,r.g.harrison, 08/05/2003,Disappointed,pos,"I drove a 3.2Tl for 90k with never a 
glitch, but the MDX is a different 
story.  It's been back to the shop 3 
times for engine warning lights; a 
high-altitude problem my Colorado 
dealer says, and tells me Acura is 
working on it.  The voice activated 
nav system doesn't recognize all the 
commands it's supposed to --  
again,I'm told Acura is working on 
it.  GM uses customers as test 
drivers, but I expected more from 
Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,apersistent1, 08/06/2003,Don't waste your money,pos,"This is the worst QUALITY car I have 
owned in 25 years.  You would not 
expect a luxury car have constant 
noises and problems.  First, noise in 
front wheel well that took 3 weeks to 
find/fix.  Next, the sound of the fuel 
sloshing in the fuel tank - Acura says 
its ""normal"" for this car.  Next, 
stereo speakers in the doors started 
vibrating.  Next, door noises.  Turns 
out the seal ""needs lubricating"".  
Next, the brakes make a clunking 
noise - Acura says a ""slight 
clicking"".  Whenever you shift, and 
apply the brakes, the 
calipers ""adjust"".  Acura says this is 
normal. Caliper adjustment IS, the 
noise ISNT!  "
acura,mdx,2003,car dude, 08/06/2003,All arounder,pos,"A great family car.  My wife drives the 
kids around.  Just went camping - Thule 
box on top, 4 bikes on the hitch and 
cruised the mountains with 3 kids 
watching a DVD in the back.  Up and 
down between sea level and 2700 ft. and 
got 21 miles to the gallon. No problem.
Take features, luxury, size, ride, 
performance, handling, price.  This car 
is an 8 or 9 across everything.  What 
other car can do that?"

acura,mdx,2003,djcurrie32, 08/14/2003,What constructive criticism can I find?,pos,"The Acura MDX is second to none in this 
price range for a luxury SUV, Acura has 
always fitted its vehicles with 
standard options that would be a la 
carte on most luxury lines, example 
heated seats, sunroof, memory seats, 6 
disc CD changer, rain sensing wipers, 
rear view camera etc...After extensive 
research and with the fold down third 
seat this was the vehicle for my 
family, it rides smooth, great 
acceleration and handling, outstanding 
exterior styling.."
acura,mdx,2003,WALF3, 08/13/2003,Gas Mileage Rip off,pos,"I've had my MDX for 5 months and am
truely dismayed at the gas mileage.  The
sticker reads 17 to 22,  but I get 13-14
mpg driving 70/30 city/hwy.   And when I
bring it to the dealer, they have some
excuse like its winter gas or we can't
know your driving habits.  Well I've
been driving for 30 years and never had
such rotten gas mileage.  And it takes
premium gas to make it worse.
Don't believe that sticker.. you're in
for a shock."
acura,mdx,2003,FG, 08/13/2003,Roof Rack Stink,pos,"Even though I love my MDX the only 
thing bad is the Roof Racks.  First of 
all they are too close to each other to 
put any soft storage carriers.  If you 
want to get a hard cargo top its not 
compatible to 99% of non-dealer 
companies.  The Acura's cargo carries 
is priced twice as much and half the 
space of THULE's brand.  So if your 
going to buy the MDX, save some money 
and don't include them in the package."
acura,mdx,2003,Sandranna, 08/16/2003,I Love My MDX,pos,"Researched cars 3 yrs, chose MDX.Waited 
9 mos (switch from '02 to '03,delayed 
it a few months).Well worth the wait! I 
accessorized it so it's the sharpest 
one I've seen yet.Very sporty!I'm 54, 
had a Buick LeSabre for 11 yrs.Needed 
something sharp, sporty. I drive safer 
now: with it's weight, it's a weapon. 
It's L/W are same as my Buick, but it 
took me a long time to get used to driv-
ing it.I did purchase a larger rearview 
mirror for help with backing up. Didn't 
know about the rear camera when I 
bought this; that whole package is EX-
PENSIVE but I&#8217;d now consider it to help 
with backing up. A great car,passengers 
love it, & I plan to keep it 15-20 yrs!"
acura,mdx,2003,Poppa Mike, 08/14/2003,My First Acura MDX,pos,"Probably will never buy anything
other than an MDX.  Love it !
Wish we had ordered the entertainment
system."
acura,mdx,2003,cavender, 08/17/2003,acura mdx,pos,"After having owned Explorer Limiteds, 
and having driven Lexus, Mercedes, GMC, 
Toyota, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, and other 
SUV's, this is definitely and clearly 
the best luxury SUV for the money.  
Extremely low maintenance and excellent 
dealer service.  Very quiet but 
powerful.  Comfortable ride, high 
visibility, well-built, good tracking, 
very versatile, packs a lot of gear.
Have never used the thrid seat, and 
luckily, it folds flat so it offers 
good storage in back.  This is easily 
the best SUV on the market.  I told 
Ford I would never be back."
acura,mdx,2003,OverTime1, 08/20/2003,Excellent vehicle,pos,"After looking closely at the Volvo 
XC90 my wife and I ended up with the 
MDX. We now have over 7500 miles on it 
and it has been TREMENDOUS vehicle. 
Outstanding ride quality, power, 
comfort and utility."
acura,mdx,2003,very happy, 08/20/2003,great value,pos,"I looked at many midsize luxury SUV's 
and this offered the best quality/cost 
of ownership/luxury for the price.  I 
have really enjoyed owning this vehicle"
acura,mdx,2003,PVoyiatzis, 08/22/2003,One awesome SUV!,pos,"One week out of the dealership, I got 
rear-ended in stop-and-go traffic by a 
Nissan.  Hardly realizing what had 
happened, I stepped out of my MDX only 
to see a TOTALLED Nissan.  I knew the 
MDX was well built, but I was still 
surprised to see that my MDX had ZERO 
damage.  I even brought it to 3 
mechanics, including the dealer just to 
rest my soul, and they found nothing 
wrong with my MDX.  I must say from 
experience that I have never driven an 
SUV (luxury or not) with this type of 
strength.

This SUV also drives awesome over 80 
mph!"
acura,mdx,2003,hiker, 08/23/2003,high country,pos,"have driven suvs in the past forget it
this is the ticket i do limited off road
but plenty of bad curvy mountain roads
and this vehicle eats them up i have
found it does great in rainy conditios
and dirt roads i get about 16mpg  in
mountains and 13mpg in city"
acura,mdx,2003,DILITE, 08/22/2003,Not bad SUV,pos,"I own my MDX for over 4 month a few
rattle's in sun roof and left rear. Gas
mileage 15 in city 21 highway. A little
expense on maintenance. The ride is smooth 
and handling is wonderful. "
acura,mdx,2003,eric is cool, 08/23/2003,wonderful,pos,its a great car for the price!!
acura,mdx,2003,GMoneyGrill, 08/26/2003,Bling Bling,pos,"I've had my fully-loaded 2003 MDX since 
March and I absolutely love it! I've 
researched it since 2001 and found it 
to be the best all-around SUV for the 
money. Love the 260 HP and after owning 
it for almost 6 months (11,000 miles 
already), I found things I like and 
dislike. I like the power/torque, 5-
speed tranny! style, features (ala-
backup camera, navi system-
breadcrumbs!, DVD-wireless headphones, 
moonroof, memory/heated FRONT SEATS, 
BOSE stereo, auto wiper/headlights, and 
2nd/3rd row fold-flat seats. Things I 
dislike are the lack of storage in the 
front area, premium gas, towing 
capacity, no dead pedal, 
navi system seems outdated, interior 
plastics."
acura,mdx,2003,Edward Bianchina, 08/26/2003,Mr,pos,"Great Vehicle. Fun to drive and 
comfortable. Interior very functional."
acura,mdx,2003,ks, 02/28/2003,what to expect from Honda,pos,"I have loved this car from day one
I owned 2 other Honda's in the past and 
was extreemely happy with them
I am conviced that this MDX will not be 
any different
Still the best looking SUV out there"
acura,mdx,2003,sad Customer, 08/28/2003,Not so happy owner,pos,"Middle Row seat is very uncomfortable. 
Wire mesh dog barrier and the plastic 
housing keeps popping out. Took 10-15 
minutes of trying to start on two 
occasions. On the first few feet of 
driving  either forward or backward 
makes a klunking noise.The acceleration 
has a lag.Revs up to 4K in first and 
second gear.The simulated wood interior 
is just fake looking.This is my 4th 
Acura. I have a 99 TL as well and with 
the TL and the MDX it seems Acura is 
trying to please everyone but has 
dropped it's quality and standard. 
ACURA should throw in less features and 
worry more about their reptation as a 
seamless car manufacturer. As for me I 
think this is my last Acura."
acura,mdx,2003,theinspector, 08/29/2003,THE MDX IS WELL WORTH THE $$$$$$$ !!!!,pos,"I've spent many months researching and 
test driving other vehicles in the 
MDX's class. Compared to the BMW X5, 
Volvo XC90, Lexus RX330,Infiniti 
FX35/45, the MDX wins hands down! You 
can't buy a better equipped and safer 
vehicle for the $$ than the MDX. Also, 
as with any Honda product, you will 
never have to worry about reliability 
and resale values."
acura,mdx,2003,rixmax, 09/01/2003,Great New SUV,pos,"Some friends of ours have an MDX that 
is a few years old and they loved 
theirs s we thought we'd look into 
them.  Wow!  What a great vehichle that 
looks great, tons of bells and 
whistles, great safety features... we 
could go on and on!"
acura,mdx,2003,CHERYL WARREN, 09/06/2003,CHERYLS OPINION,pos,"THIS VEHICHLE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND 
DOES NOT HAVE THE TRUCK RIDE THAT MANY 
OTHER MODELS HAVE.IT IS FUN TO DRIVE 
AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE. I LOVE IT!"
acura,mdx,2003,EK1988, 09/06/2003,A GOOD CHOICE,pos," A GOOD VEHICLE - WE DEBATED BETWEEN 
THE ACURA AND A 4 RUNNER LIMITED.  SAME 
PRICE BUT BETTER FEATURES IN THE 
ACURA.  TIME AND CONTINUED USE WILL 
DICTATE VALUE."
acura,mdx,2003,jeannie, 09/06/2003,I love my suv,pos,"I love this car. What more can I can?  
Fun to drive-you bet! Handling-WOW!  I 
bought it for realiability and I have 
gotten so much more!"
acura,mdx,2003,MOM MOBILE, 09/06/2003,lOVE THAT CAR,pos,"I absolutely love the car.  Coming from 
a minivan it is a welcome relief.  the 
only thing I do not like about the car 
is the small gas tank size.  I am 
constantly filling up with gas.  I like 
the navigational system and use it 
frequently. I also like the camera that 
shows what is behind me when I am 
backing up. "
acura,mdx,2003,Snyder, 09/06/2003,Great Car,pos,"Navigation system is fantastic for big 
city like Atlanta and is VERY easy to 
use. The MDX has GREAT pep to get 
around on the highways. Interior setup 
very practical. Love it!  "
acura,mdx,2003,LoveMyMDX, 09/06/2003,I love It,pos,"This car has everything it 
promised..high quality, fun to drive, 
navigation, back-up camera and the kids 
love the entertainment system."
acura,mdx,2003,songb42, 09/06/2003,Extremely Satisfied,pos,"I am completely satisfied with this 
vehicle.  My MDX drives like a car, but 
has the power of a truck.  It is very 
comfortable and fun to drive."
acura,mdx,2003,me plus 3, 09/06/2003,Acura for a family,pos,"I chose the MDX after trying out just 
about every mid-size SUV available.  
The MDX has the most interior room 
(almost as much as some of the large 
SUVs) and fared well in crash tests.  
Overall, I am very happy with it.  My 
husband and I are both tall and we have 
2 babies, double stroller, etc, 2 car 
seats, but still roomy.  It rides well, 
is okay with gas for an SUV.  I love 
the option of the 2 back seats 
(although not the most comfortable)
The only area that needs attention is 
the interior (which does not both me) - 
It is plain, very simple features, not 
much on the dashboard as far as 
extras.  "
acura,mdx,2003,mikeandjudy, 09/06/2003,Outstanding SUV,pos,"Nothing to dislike about this vehicle.  
Perfect size SUV for small family.  Has 
not disappointed us at all.  Wonderful 
on trips and around town (easy to 
park).  Comfortable, roomy and a great 
sound system."
acura,mdx,2003,Angelastarr, 09/06/2003,My new MDX,pos,"By no means bland, the Acura MDX is 
surefooted off the road and elegant on 
the road.It handles like a dream.  The 
extra width in the back, about 6"" more 
than most SUVs, allows for an 
airmattress for safer camping and helps 
me in my volunteer work which involves 
transporting cats and kittens for 
healthcare and adoption.  So the fuel 
efficiency doesn't bother me.  I have 
the best of both worlds...a truck and a 
sports car."
acura,mdx,2003,geneo212, 09/06/2003,Geno's MDX,pos,"The MDX is a comfortable and versatile 
vehicle.  The beauty of an Acura is 
that you get so much as standard 
equipment.  I compared the MDX with the 
BMW X5.  There was no way to keep the 
price point anywhere close to the MDX 
with the same trim options. The X5 is a 
great driving vehicle, but the MDX is 
just fit the bill more overall."
acura,mdx,2003,Alexander Kopitko, 09/08/2003,One of the best SUV on the market,pos,"We bought this car last week after 
testing Murano. It's bigger, more 
powerfull, more comfortable."
acura,mdx,2003,jhc, 09/09/2003,"Great car, but dealership needs to imprv",pos,"What a great car.  This is my second 
Acura.  My first Acura was TL and it 
was a good experience overall.  Hoping 
the same experience, but for MDX the 
dealerships were too arrogant.  I 
almost did not buy this car until I 
went to this dealership where I bought 
it from.  Had to buy this car, because
there is nothing else that could match
the features/performance/quality at 
this price."
acura,mdx,2003,Dr. Joel Adler, 09/13/2003,The Best SUV on the market today,pos,"This is my third Acura but my first SUV.
I am very pleased with this and my 
other Acuras, as I have never had to 
take the vehicles into be service.  The 
quality of workmenship is excellent. I 
have over my live time purchased over 
forty new vehicles for personal use and 
all other vehicles needed warranty 
work.I do use this vehicle (SUV) for 
personal use and also as a tow vehicle 
behind my motorhome.  It pulls very 
easy on all four wheels and I do not 
notice the extra weight behind my 
motorhome."
acura,mdx,2003,AnnW., 09/16/2003,Love my MDX,pos,"I love the smooth and comfort ride in 
the MDX. I had to test the Break once, 
and I was pleased with its 
performance. There is much more room 
in the 2nd row than our other SUV. And 
the 3rd is very easy to use and 
getting into. "
acura,mdx,2003,gordon wheaton, 09/16/2003,2003 MDX (Loaded),pos,"I was actually contacted by two dealers 
in Houston who wanted my 2001 MDX to 
meet used car MDX customer demand. I 
decided to trade mine in when a new 
2003 load arrived. My 2001 sold the 
same day I picked up my upgraded 2003 
(fully loaded). I was surprised at the 
improved performance/comfort/sound 
system since I really had great success 
with 2001. I researched and found MDX 
still the best SUV on the market bar 
none!"
acura,mdx,2003,hermantam, 07/21/2003,Value-for-money champ,pos,"- Superior value over Lexus
- Reliability over most European brands 
per JD Power (I traded-in my 
problematic ML for the MDX)
- Sportier than the RX and GX: precise 
steering, great engine
- Better looking than the FX"
acura,mdx,2003,X-um, 07/20/2003,Simply the best,pos,"This is the best SUV EVER.  All others 
still attempt to copy it but perfectly 
can't be duplicated, just immitated."
acura,mdx,2003,carolyn, 07/23/2003,Love my MDX,pos,"I am so thrilled with my new MDX.  It 
handles so well on the road, and I feel 
so comfortable and safe driving it.  I 
previously have driven a Lexus...and a 
Volvo both always top of the line.  But 
I prefer the MDX over both of these 
other cars.  And the value is 
incredible."
acura,mdx,2003,j mig, 08/07/2003,excellant,pos,"This SUV is excellant. I love it-with a 
child it has plenty of room. the car 
drives great & believe it or not-its 
great on gas."
acura,mdx,2003,mr c., 08/08/2003,Quality,pos,Just a great car to drive
acura,mdx,2003,mdx by al, 08/08/2003,2003 mdx,pos,"great suv. tested the lexus, bmw, 
ford, gmc ect. no question for the 
money the mdx is the hands down 
favorite. ride is execellent, the 
quality is first rate."
acura,mdx,2003,Tedd Slugg, 08/12/2003,A Very Typical Acura - Great!,pos,"Quite simply it is the best value in a 
luxury SUV on the market. Big 
enough to haul lots of  ""stuff"", but 
handles much like my ACURA RL. My 
wife loves the way it handles and 
does not have to climb in-and-out 
like many higher SUVs. Easily the 
best SUV we test drove - and we tried 
them all - and its sticker price is 
realitively low. Just can't beat the 
overall package."
acura,mdx,2003,heather , 08/27/2003,mdx is the best,pos,"The MDX rides smooth, it is extremly 
comfortable and drives like a luxury 
car.  I can fit seven people plus a 
stroller and a picnic.   It is truly like 
having a luxury car and SUV in one.  I 
had a suburban and this is so much 
better that I cannot believe I ever 
owned a suburban.  I love it and will 
only get rid of it to give it to my 
daughter when she drives and then 
buy another one for myself!"
acura,mdx,2003,dk, 08/28/2003,Superb entry lux SUV,pos,"If you're interested in a 7-seater lux 
SUV, the MDX is for you. The exterior 
design is conservative but appealing. 
The leather seats are very good, but 
other interior materials could be 
improved. The V6 has lively 
performance, but at the expense of 
poor gas mileage in low gear (I'd love 
a hybrid of this vehicle!). The 3rd 
row seats sold us, together with very 
well balanced safety features inside 
and out--such as the VTM-4 and VSA."
acura,mdx,2003,KBarker, 09/03/2003,future lemon???,pos,"smooth engine and drive train. for the 
money it should have power lumbar 
seats. fuel economy on the sticker is a 
wishful dream!!  taken back to dealer 
twice the first two weeks!! had to 
replace parts on the a/c due to loosing 
all the freon. they say that's a first 
for them. hope this is not a trend!! 
easy to drive and great turning 
radius.  regret spending so much for an 
suv though. at least with a tahoe you 
know the milage is bad and more power!!"
acura,mdx,2003,asmdpa, 09/19/2003,best Suv we bought ever,pos,"we have only 3000 miles on our 2003 
touring MDX and we already love it.
This is our third SUV and we had best 
dealership experience so far.
Mdx is powerful, reliable in bad 
weather and we give it a 10"
acura,mdx,2003,Michael Anderson, 09/19/2003,Surprised...,pos,"I'm a former RL owner, and was 
pleasently surprised that the MDX 
offeres all the creature comforts of 
the RL, with the Storage capacity of a 
truck.  The ride is better than that of 
the RL in my opinion, probably due to 
the improved suspension system."
acura,mdx,2003,Debi & Ira Weiss, 09/19/2003,Try it and You will buy it!,pos," Previous to test driving this SUV my 
husband and I sat across from one at a 
red light and he said he did not like 
it, while test driving the BMW  SUV 
(along with 8 other manufactures.  The 
salesperson recommended this for our 
needs of our family, by that night my 
husband had a new love.  Almost 1 year 
later and we feel that it was one of 
our best purchases. It has been a real 
pleasure.  "
acura,mdx,2003,vncjj, 09/23/2003,Stitch,pos,Good Great Fuel Ecocomy To Buy
acura,mdx,2003,Tadgh45, 09/30/2003,mdx 2003,pos,"I was an original 2001 MDX owner and 
loved every minute of it.Auto Week's 
excellent test of the vehicle in 
Belize convinced me that this vehicle 
was for me. So,2 brief years later,it 
was a no brainer on what my next 
vehicle would be.All I can say about 
the 2003 MDX is that Acura actually 
improved on what I thought could have 
no improvement.I LOVE it! Bravo,Acura!"
acura,mdx,2003,Bobkes, 09/25/2003,Best SUV yet,pos,"This Acura is the third suv I have 
owned, after driving a 1996 Jeep Grand 
Cherokee, and a  1997 Nissan 
Pathfinder. It is the best yet. Drives 
and handles like a car with no 
skittishness in the corners, with wide 
comfortable seats, good head room, and 
a comfortable driving position. Plenty 
of power when you need it, and great in 
snow.
other than gravel trails. Feel it is 
the best Suv out there now, others are 
too small, too trucklike, or too 
expensive for what you get.Small peeve, 
picked up a couple of parking lot door 
dings because of no side moulding 
protection, metal dents easily. Good 
ride so far, will see how it does after 
some more miles."
acura,mdx,2003,amarlow, 09/25/2003,MDX - good but not great,pos,"Bought MDX about 6 weeks ago.  Really 
like it except that I find the drivers 
seat very uncomfortable (too firm) and 
there is an annoying rattle that I 
need to take back to dealer to fix.  
Looked at many SUV's and thought this 
was the whole package.  "
acura,mdx,2003,ppg, 10/03/2003,Awsome SUV,pos,"It's a great SUV, compared to what we 
have in the market.  The Volvo XC90 
fairs well too, but this one has lots 
of features which the Volvo does not 
have and costs lots more when you buy 
the pacakges."
acura,mdx,2003,GAaliveDRIVE, 10/04/2003,Why want more?,pos,"This is a vehicle that satisfies in 
most every area required.   Highly 
competent handling, power, roominess, 
when combined with the sweet purr of 
the V6 Honda engine could bring a 
smile to the most ardent critic.   I 
considered many others before driving 
the MDX and knew in an instant that 
this one, although not perfect in 
every regard, was the one.    

Come to think of it, what ONE vehicle 
is perfect in every respect?   The 
answer is NONE of them.   The MDX 
comes as close to doing everything 
well that I've encountered."
acura,mdx,2003,CorpusD, 10/06/2003,MDX touring w/NAV,pos,"Overall this vehicle has met my 
expectations. I was leary at first 
because I have never owned a japanese 
build vehicle. However the quality and 
value for you rmoney are well worth 
it. The whole family loves it and is 
perfect for a midsized SUV. The 3rd 
row seats are also a plus."
acura,mdx,2003,elcuban, 10/10/2003,good decision,pos,"after been trying diferents SUV's that 
was the the best decision,looks a 
superfast vehicule ,i only have 
300,its a lot of fun.the navigation 
sistem is great.all the instrument are 
excellent,comfort,stabiliy are 
excellent.   thanks"
acura,mdx,2003,vcnyc, 10/11/2003,Acura MDX,pos,"The MDX is fun to drive and extremely 
responsive in harsh weather.  It breaks 
on the dime in rain and snow.  The 
interior is extremely comfortable and 
spacious.  My only disappointment is 
fuel economy.  I am averaging 14 mpg in 
the city and 20 on the highway."
acura,mdx,2003,blue opal, 10/11/2003,excellen toverall,pos,"Beautiful car has third row, lots of 
power, dependable good in snow , 
excelleent daily driver.  Pound for 
pound the BEST suv in its class."
acura,mdx,2003,Caper, 10/13/2003,Beautiful,pos,Love it!!  The blue is a hot color!!
acura,mdx,2003,Mattyloudness, 10/13/2003,A Super SUV,pos,"A ton of room and flexibility with the 
seating, and it drives great at 75mph!  
So smooth and quiet and handles 
perfect.  It also gives you so many 
options that are standard you do not 
have to add anything to it!  It's our 
first SUV and glad to have it!"
acura,mdx,2003,Fabvsix, 10/15/2003,On the road again........,pos,"Having come from an Acura CL Type S, I 
thought I was in a CL on steroids ! I 
can only speak on behalf of the 03's 
which I understand got alot of 
improvements ! Steering at higher 
speeds is superb. Acceleration is silky 
smooth, this vehicle has PLENTY of get 
up and go ! Braking is fine too ! The 
seats are as comfortable as the CL's ! 
I think the CL has the most comfortable 
seats in the Acura line up ! Yes that 
includes those NSX seats......As far as 
build quality, Acura needs to ""beef it 
up"", as they have dropped. Upon 
delivery, I had numerious fixes needed. 
Of course Acura took care of all. Since 
all is dandy. I would highly recommend 
this vehicle ! "
acura,mdx,2003,CD52, 10/18/2003,A delightful experience,pos,"This car has lived up to its reputation as a 
terrific family-friendly, luxury SUV (family-
friendly because why else would you have the 
DVD entertainment system?). It's fun to drive, 
configurable for a zillion different needs, and 
comfortable beyond what we expected. It 
compares favorably with our other car -- A 
Mercedes E Class sedan."
acura,mdx,2004,Jill G., 09/08/2016,400k miles strong,pos,"This car was the best investment in a car we have ever made.  My husband bought it new for me in 2004.  I have just hit 401,000 miles.  It still has the original engine, but the transmission was replaced about 200k miles.  Regular maintenance and an exceptional service department have given this girl of mine the longevity she deserves!!  A lot of history and many miles on the road together have made this purchase over 12 years ago a wonderful gift. My next car will be an Acura, likely an RDX, as the new MDX is way out of my price point, and nearly matches what I spent on my first house. I would and have on numbers of occasions, without hesitation recommend buying an Acura to anyone who will listen.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Tabasco, 10/02/2003,It's the best SUV,pos,"This is the best SUV on the market. Here are 
my only complaints: The switch for the 
sunroof is located to the left of the drivers 
wheel. Passenger can not control the sunroof. 
The other annoying thing is the clock, located 
on the radio which most times is not readable. 
They should either locate it in the instrument 
cluster or make it bright so I don't need 
glasses to see the time. It would be nice to 
make a time button on the Navigation screen."
acura,mdx,2004,lgq2001, 09/11/2014,A great SUV,pos,Got it at 160k. It ran and drove very well. Now it has 190k. No any problems and still runs like new. I really like it. 
acura,mdx,2004,Terry, 08/13/2010,"2004 MDX reliable after 100,000",pos,"I have had my car for 4 years and reached 100,000 miles on it and still a great car to drive and dependable. Only changing the oil and brake pads. No problems with maintenance. This car is amazing while in town or traveling on vacation on the highway. Its an All Weather car also. Forget Toyota or Nissan, Acura has definitely made a quality car to last a long time."
acura,mdx,2004,Costa, 02/21/2016,Just hit 170k miles and very reliable,pos,"I bought this as a third vehicle (instead of a work truck for my rental properties) with about 160k miles.  I have owned it for a little over a year and it just hit 170k miles with no major problems.  The original owner maintained it well for it's first 160k miles, as have I for the last 10k miles.  I do have to replace the power steering pump soon, the loud whine that seems to be a common problem, but otherwise no problems.  I have never owned a car with mileage this high so I have no basis for comparison but I am very happy with the reliability.  

It also drives great and if the odometer said 50k miles I would believe it.  The navigation system seems very modern for a 12 year old car and the leather is in like new condition.  We have an Infiniti JX35 with 50k miles and the drivers seat is already more worn than this MDX with 170k miles; they must have used a very high quality/durable leather.  

The only downsides are no blue tooth in the 2004, I believe 2005 models have blue tooth, and the interior is small for a 3 row SUV (trade off for handling well for a 3 row SUV).

acura,mdx,2004,TT Smith, 12/10/2016,Pleased,pos,"I spent a significant amount of time preparing for and shopping for a used vehicle as a primary vehicle. My previous vehicle was dying and I needed a replacement. Highlander, Lexus 330, Traverse ... but once I drove the MDX, I knew that a 2007 or 8 was what I was looking for ... Then I found this 2004 with only 88K miles and 'imported' from San Diego to Denver area. What a bulletproof beast she has been for the last year. Pretty heavy travel year, and I'm now at 112K with only great performance. Little bit more money into it after the purchase than I anticipated: timing belt, 105K maintenance, 2 motor mounts, new tires, new leather on the passenger side. But, I love the 3.5, the ride and the performance in the snow ... and great road trip vehicle for 1,000+ mile trips. Probably, the best vehicle I've ever owned -- we'll see. Basically, looks brand new so I expect that I'll get 5-10 years out of it. I agree with all of the positives listed on these reviews. Like the previous Lady's review, if it lasts that long, I'd be happy to keep it to 400K, I feel.

UPDATE 6/20/17:  By the time the 4th of July Holiday is over, I will have put over 40K miles on this 2004 MDX during my 18 months of ownership. I'm happy. Other than the above, the only other things I've handled on this vehicle is having the worn out leather redone on the drivers side.  Change the oil every 5K (uses about a quart), rotate the tires and get it aligned on the unlimited package at Sears. When I get to 150K I'll have the front end redone and replace the sway bar (about $1100). Otherwise, I expect she'll just keep going. Great road-trip vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Sunil, 10/30/2017,Beast that puts latest SUVs to Shame,pos,"I recently moved to US and this is first car I bought based on overall reviews of used SUVs. I bought it at 131K and had no idea what to look out while buying a used car which costed me heavy since its all maintenance were pending. I spent over 4100 Buying 4 new Tyre, Timing Belt, replacing whole Power steering kit, front sway bars, rear shockers, driver side passenger door motor+regulator kit, front axles. The Car runs like beast, I haven't traveled very long distances but my last 500+ mile trip was great. Power is available when I want, it accelerates when I want, even after driving it 3-4 hours continuously, don't feel tired. While It was given for fix, I was offered Equinox and Nissan Rogue for driving and I'm not getting into those SUVs again. I tried couple of more SUVs and they felt like plastic boxes. Having spent so much, My Mechanic says this Car is now good for another 60K mile without any mechincal or transmission issues. I asked him how long can I drive it and he said it will easily go 300K + miles.

acura,mdx,2004,Corrinne, 09/23/2018,265k and going strong,pos,"This vehicle lasts! I have 265k miles and still going strong.  Diver seat has torn and there is some sort of leak that causes front floor/carpets to be wet every time the road is wet.  Not coming from the top down , as it can happen when the roads are wet without it raining.  The capacity is tremendous!  I use it to move furniture for my staiging business and can haul sofas in the back with the 3rd row seats laid flat.  I also drive real estate clients around in the winter and it has gotten us in and out of some dicey road and snow conditions.  Luxury and toughness combined - I love this MDX!  Has been my primary vehicle for 11 years now!
"
acura,mdx,2004,lgq2001, 09/09/2014,I really enjoy it,pos,"Get it from a small dealer with 165k mile on it. It runs and drives always great with such a high mile. Now, it has about 190k, no any problems. really like it. The best SUV on the road. "
acura,mdx,2004,Tong Chang, 01/27/2016,BEST BANGS FOR THE BUCKS,pos,"I have 335,000 miles on this car. Still going strong with original motor. Only changed out the Alternator, Belts, and struts/shock. Proper maintenance will this car will give you many years.
"
acura,mdx,2004,Joe C., 04/24/2010,Affordable luxury SUV,pos,"Driven over 112k in less than 6 years. No mechanical problems. Drives very smooth and still handles/feels like a new vehicle after so long. Some cosmetic problems here and there. Sales person pressured to buy extended warranty, but it is waste of money. Overall a reliable and affordable luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2004,Alex, 06/08/2010,Great car but some repairs required,pos,"Overall this is a great car, got it back in 2004 brand new, traded up from the Maxima, MDX handles excellently in bad weather, awesome traction. Great room in the back for the kids. I have 90,000 and it started requiring maintenance, so far replaced 2 engine mounts and will be replacing the 3rd one very soon along with the inner tie rod, the rear shocks had to be replaced at 30k. Funny enough I don't do any off road driving or towing, just regular city commute. We'll still keep the car for another 10k and probably trade it for something else. "
acura,mdx,2004,tfmeisen, 09/29/2009,Nice Vehicle,pos,"I decided that I wanted a luxury SUV. I drove several different types and I believe that the Acura MDX is one of the best vehicles for your money on the market today.  It has the size, and space of an SUV, but rides like a luxury car.  The interior is plush and the features are great and easy to use.  I had every option except for the navigation and DVD player.  It had plenty of power and still got good gas mileage, on a long trip I could get over 22 mpg which is incredible considering the size.  The only problems I had: the cruise control broke, and I somehow broke the front motor mount and it was expensive.  The other downside is the vehicle has to be serviced by Acura for most things."
acura,mdx,2004,rowemowe, 07/31/2004,Try something else,pos,"Don't make the same mistake I did.

Research this vehicle before you buy.  
Do a search on Google or Yahoo for ""MDX 
Noise"" and you'll see that there is a 
cronic problem with brake and gas tank 
noise that is called ""normal"" by the 
manufacturer.  

When you test drive the vehicle, make 
sure you keep the radio off and have a 
nearly full tank of gas.  Let the car 
idle forward and hit the brake.  If you 
can live with the sounds of gas 
sloshing around and the back brake 
thud, then you won't mind spending 35K -
40K.

Also, take a look at all of the 
Technical Service Bulletins issued by 
Acura on this vehicle.  You can find 
them at the NHTSA website."
acura,mdx,2004,carmin ator, 07/15/2005,It's the ultimate driver's machine,pos,"The MDX is the ultimate driver's machine. The ""ultimate driving machine"" might be good for short hops from the mansion to the golf course. But the MDX is perfect for hauling 6 humans and luggage for a 10 day road-trip. Handling is crisp and taut. Interior room is adequate for 6 - if you put the kids in the last row. The convenience package is adequate neither underwhelming nor overwhelming. The safety features crumple zones, breakaway mounts, full curtain side airbags, etc. are uptodate. Mileage was a paltry 12-13mpg street and 20-25 hwy. For absolute comfort buy the Navigator; for raw power buy the X5. But if you're on a budget and want an all-round SUV that's awesome to drive buy the MDX."
acura,mdx,2004,Midlifemom, 10/08/2007,Excellent car to own and drive,pos,"I drive 40K a year.  Perfect vehicle.  Decent mileage (20.5 on highway).  Will not tip like Sequoia, 4Runner.  Excellent in rain, snow.  Excellent sound.  Very perfect vision all around for driving safety.  Good in curves, swerving.  Mirrors great, melt snow.  Tows my boat great, out of steep ramps.  Windshield banked so no chips from rocks.  Fog lights catch deer on dark highway at night for you, safer.  Passes fine.  Pick up fine.  Looks pretty.  Never, never, never screws up.  Have never had to have it fixed.  I have 113,000 miles.  Very fine car, recommend it.  Others I have had are Yukon, Sequoia, Mercedes, Volvo.  "
acura,mdx,2004,tedelco, 02/06/2004,Bad Humming Noise,pos,"I have owned a 2004 Acura MDX SUV for 
about two months. This car has caused 
me many problems. When I drive at an 
engine speed of 2000 RPMS I can hear 
an annoying, constant humming noise. 
The Acura dealer has checked it a 
number of times and tell me it is 
normal and cannot do anything about 
it. I have also contacted the Acura 
Manufacturer and they have given me 
the same reply. I do not know what 
else I can do.
To all future 2004 Acura MDX SUV 
costumers: when you take a test drive 
for this car, make sure to listen for 
this noise when the engine speed 
reaches about 2000 RPMS. Thank you."
acura,mdx,2004,Michael, 12/14/2018,DONT BUY!! READ MY REVIEW,neg,"I bought a used mdx 2004. I thought if I had to buy an older vehicle Acura would be the way to go. Boy was I wrong. I've had it 2 months and now going on my third YES I SAID 3RD transmission in this piece of absolute JUNK ! The navigation doesn't work, Acura wants big money to fix it, heated seat no,longer works. Acura KNOWS ABOUT THEIR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND DO NOTHING TO HELP THE OWNERS OF THEIR JUNK VEHICLES. Do NOT BUY AND MDX OF ANY YEAR.

acura,mdx,2004,jms112997, 02/08/2010,"185,000 Miles and still going strong!",pos,"I've owned just about everything, this is the best vehicle I have owned.  I still get about 19mpg mixed approaching 200k miles.  Ordered it new, all options.  Followed all major services thus far.  There are not many vehicles out there that can go 2 car seats and a booster wide, have great cargo capacity, handles like a sedan, AWD (fantastic in the Michigan snow), and get great gas mileage, oh and the reliability: I've replaced one light bulb, one tail lightbulb and thats it.  It has been in 3 different small accidents and just keeps going.  Highly recommend anything honda/acura. "
acura,mdx,2004,rlb30, 11/03/2003,Solid SUV,pos,"Great, solid vehicle. Comfortable on a 
long trip, wide stance gives a very 
stable ride, bigger inside than it 
looks.  Lot's of power.  Don't know 
about the lackluster interior comments 
from some reviewers, but it is 
functional and fine with me.  

Only complaint I have is the gearshift 
could be better designed and easier to 
move between gears.  Not as ""off road"" 
as my Jeep, but it doesn't claim to 
be.  Also, I wouldn't buy it if I had 
to use it to tow much weight."
acura,mdx,2004,Baltimore Owner, 06/14/2005,Pretty Good - but NOT perfect !,pos,"Bought in Nov 2004 as leftover - got excellent deal (below invoice).  Vehicle has had several problems since then: 1.  Tire(s):  Touring was supposed to have Michelin ONE of the 4 tires was a GOODYEAR !! (dealer fixed) 2.  Despite VERY VERY gentle driving, developed shimmy at 7k miles and had brake rotors cut (dealer fixed) 3. Interior speaker cover fell off spontaneously (dealer fixed) 4.  Headliner rattles VERY loudly on left side when going over large bumps or RR tracks - Dealer could NOT fix .."
acura,mdx,2004,LoopyL10, 11/16/2004,I LOVE this car!,pos,"After driving a Ford Explorer for 6 
years, I think I died and went to 
heaven once we purchased the MDX! A 
smooth, comfortable ride, good gas 
mileage for its size and plenty of 
room. Great power, a fun car to drive 
and own. I highly recommend over the 
Volvo, you won't regret this purchase! 
If you are considering the Pilot try 
spurging on the MDX; a much more 
luxurious, better riding SUV.    "
acura,mdx,2004,kevman1, 01/26/2007,I'd buy another X,pos,"This has been the perfect vehicle for me because: 1. I drive 45 miles to work, so the 25 mpg I get (driving gently) is great. 2. I can fit anything I need to inside, since it can accommodate boards/items 4' wide. 3. I love the way it looks. 4. It was cheaper than all the other SUVs I was looking at. 5. I've had NO major issues with it for 78k miles. 6. I can perform my own maintenance (all 4 fluid changes)."
acura,mdx,2004,crazyhutch, 12/28/2003,Love the MDX!!!,pos,"Awesome from top to bottom.  The

the DVD is great for traveling with 
kids.  Great gas mileage, features, and 
design."
acura,mdx,2004,Ken, 03/13/2009,Honda is Plastically Challanged!,pos,"Pretty nice overall, aside from the front air vent falling off in my hand and the rear speaker covers can be easily pried off without tools.  The whole interior is bland and it drives like the Queen Mary II."
acura,mdx,2004,Steve Jones, 09/04/2009,Don't buy,neg,"This vehicle has been the most unreliable vehicle I have ever owned.  In the last 5 months, I have spent over a $1000 on the transmission (torque converter and another switch) and another $700 on the power steering (a loud whine).  Both of these problems have numerous complaints against them, but Acura won't do anything since it's not under warranty.  There are service bulletins out for these issues, but Acura won't do anything until forced to by a recall."
acura,mdx,2004,sro100, 01/06/2005,Great,pos,We love the MDX. Highly recommended. 
acura,mdx,2004,Thorstein36, 10/03/2003,Too Nice to Believe!,pos,"I feel totally secure when driving in 
the worst weather--this MDX is a dream

touch of luxury, and is absolutely 
reliable."
acura,mdx,2004,Karicher, 10/09/2003,Rpleaced our Explorer,pos,"Safe and fun to drive.  Purchased due 
to reliability, safety ratings, 
traction and stability control 
systems.  Plenty of interior room 
while not looking as big from outside."
acura,mdx,2004,dscott, 02/03/2005,Crash tested with flying colors,pos,"I love my MDX - it makes me feel really safe when I drive it.  I'd had it 3 months with 4K miles when another driver crossed the median and hit me head on (he was uninsured, but that's another story).  All the airbags deployed -  front, side curtain, passenger.  Other than a slightly burned hand from the deploying airbags, and the accompanying muscle aches and pains, I walked away in one piece.  All the safety features, including the airbags, did their thing, absorbing the impact. My next vehicle will definitely be another MDX.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Joanne Melanson, 11/04/2003,It is OK,pos,"Design flaw in retractable front seat 
belts causes the belts to snap back 
too quickly and hit the door jamb.  
The result is small nicks on the door 
casing that will only get worse as the 
car ages.   Tape over the area  helps 
diminish this problem.  Fuel economy 
is not good on local travel but ok on 
highway.  Third seat is useless."
acura,mdx,2004,mysimonj, 11/10/2003,Pretty darn good,pos,"Just got a 2004 Touring RES/Nav 'cause 
I needed more space for the baby and 
cargo space to carry more than a golf 
bag in my bimmer.  I knew that Acura 
always had a good reputation for 
overall refinement and quality and 
this vehicle does meet my 
expectations.  Very smooth engine 
which is surprisingly quick, its cargo 
space is monstrous; ottoman, weber 
grill, you name it-it fits.  Third row 
seating is practical for my minisized 
friends.  Excellent vehicle with such 
practicality, truly an ""UTILITY"" 
vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,DocDad, 12/06/2003,"Classy, practical, and worry free",pos,"This is a wonderful vehicle.  I'd buy 
it over and over again. It's nice 
enough to make me feel special, and to 
make others jealous.  It handles well 
with good power, and the ride is 
smooth without being floaty. All the 
little things (seat warmers, cup 
holders, seat position controls, side 
mirror heaters) are functional, solid, 
and well thought-out.  Great for 
driving alone or with a carload of 
kids.  I bought the base model and 
custom installed a DVD player for the 
back, costing much less than getting 
the Touring model with its DVD 
option.  The climate controls are a 
little hard to figure out, but work 
well. "
acura,mdx,2004,Walter_NH, 12/07/2003,Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"Had a Jeep Grand Cherokee for 9 
years.  After looking at the 
flexability, performance, winter 
driving and reliability of Lexus, BMW, 
Volvo, Infinity, Nisson, VW,Toyota and 
Acura; there was really only one 
choice - the ACURA MDX.  A test drove 
all the SUV's and read information for 
two months before making the final 
pick.  I paid $36,500 ($400 under 
invoice).  It was the base model.  For 
an extra $4,000 to $6,000 I could have 
got some nice extras (NAV, DVD, Sound 
system, etc.) but decided the base 
model was a great deal.  We just had 
our first big snow storm in New 
England 15"" to 30"" and the MDX was 
perfect, I mean just great in the snow 
and sleet ! "
acura,mdx,2004,Paclark11, 02/11/2004,Ultimate Performer,pos,"This SUV is awesome. I really do not 
understand the complaints about gas 
mileage. I live in the DC Metro Area, 
and I average 18.5 - 19.6 miles per 
gallon CITY, and 25.4 - 26.7 HIGHWAY.  
The MDX is hands down the best luxury 
SUV under $45,000 sticker. Remember 
follow the break in period per the 
owners manual and the gas mileage will 
increase guaranteed."

acura,mdx,2004,snaser, 05/20/2006,Great SUV,pos,"The Accura MDX is a great SUV for the family & fun to drive alone. It is the perfect size & height...not too big. The lines are sexy and sleek, I love the heated seats (which I use all year round). It is comfortable and dependable."

Actually recieved higher mileage than 
any tank in prior SUV and longer range 
than prior vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,TJP, 06/17/2005,"Perfect, but no Hybrid",pos,"We're had our Premium model for almost a year, and we've thoroughly enjoyed it to date.  No problems, as you'd expect from a Honda product, excellent comfort and room, and decent power.  Fuel economy never has been above 19 mpg, however, despite highway only jaunts.  Admittedly, these have been at high speeds (75-80 mph), at which drag would be substantial for a vehicle this size.  If we wanted maximum fuel economy, we'd have gotten a Jetta diesel with a trailer for our stuff.  For our needs, the MDX has been perfect"
acura,mdx,2004,lvernacc, 06/19/2005,I Love My MDX,pos,"I purchased my MDX a year ago after researching and test driving all comparable SUV's.  I chose the MDX for the roominess, feel and gas mileage.  By far this vehicle handles better than any other in it's class.  There is plenty of leg room in all three rows and comes standard with front and side airbags.  I would recommend this car to everyone.  It comes in handy for traveling with children and teenagers."

I have an ACURA Legend that has remained reliable with over 180k on it. That helped convince me to stick with ACURA in the SUV department. The MDX feels sturdy, and drive very nicely.  You have a commanding feel behind the wheel, and good visibility.  The navigation system is awesome. It is more than just an expensive toy. It will give you the confidence to venture into unknown territory without trepidation.  I once drove an hour down back roads that didn't show on most maps, and I didn't have a clue as to where I was, or how to get out.  Then I used the nav, and it guided me precisely and ACURA-tely back to main roads, and home."

have an icon that idicated when the 
tire pressure it low. Though, keep in 
mind just because the pressure is low 
doesnt mean there is a nail in the

say is the camera which comes on the

It is very reliable, because it is built by Honda, otherwise it is horrible. The seats are hard and get VERY uncomfortable on trips. It is very big, not smooth, and needs a better turing radius. It also gets horrible gas mileage, about 16 mpg. I have driven my sisters RX330 and found it is very comforatable and feels like you are driving on a cloud.Plus it has a great turning radius, and the service is great! It also gets 25mpg. Dont buy the MDX, it you want performance and dependable luxury, go to Lexus. I cant wait for my lease to end, to purchase the RX330"
acura,mdx,2004,Jon R, 07/20/2009,Reliable and Comfortable,pos,"I bought this car used with 19K mi in 10/2005.  I now have 56K mi.  The car is extremely reliable and very comfortable.  It handles nicely and it is no surprise that you still see so many late MDX's still on the road and still in great shape.  For all of the features that you get on this car, it really is a great value.  The cars are not cheap, but you get a lot of standard options in these cars that would drive the price up on other comparable models from other brands.  Also, the car doesn't seem very big, but my wife and I are amazed at how much room you have inside.  They did a great job using the space.  It is a great family car and would consider getting a new one."

It was $8,000.00 less than a Lexus GX470 & the BMW X5. Seats are extremely confortable and the navigation system is user friendly. a joy to drive everyday. The dealer options available really dress this vehicle up."
acura,mdx,2004,hzbbgl, 10/14/2003,Smooth drivng SUV,pos,"The Acura MDX is a fun to drive, it 
rides so smooth its like driving a 
smooth riding car. You don't feel like 
your driving a SUV becauses it low to 
the ground.  The interior design is 
great, it even has a camera on the tail 
so when you are in reverse the screen 
were the navigator system is will show 
you what is behind.  It has a voice 
activiated system for the navigator so 
you don't have to push any bottoms when 
you need driving directions.  It has 
room for 7. It's worth the price."
acura,mdx,2004,Zoeyleigh, 11/01/2003,Perfect SUV,pos,"Love this car! Great to drive, hugs the 
road well. Roomy enough inside for 
kids,dogs and luggage. Fun to drive and 
sporty looking."
acura,mdx,2004,alibclan, 11/11/2003,smooth ride,pos,"this vehicle handles great. at 80 mph 
it feels like it is travelling 55. 
tight around corners for an suv. it is 
also very comfortable inside, has lots 
of room and a very good sound system."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXer, 11/13/2003,Only Gets Better,pos,"I traded my 2001 MDX in for the 2004.  
What a difference 3 years makes.  The 
MDX drives better, is faster, more 
responsive and more comfortable then 
the 2001.  The kids love the 
entertainment system."
acura,mdx,2004,snobny, 11/19/2003,Bad Start,pos,"After buying my car on Saturday night, 
Monday afternoon I was going home from 
work when my car wouldn't start. I 
ended up haveing it towed to the 
nearest Acura dealership. This is my 
second MDX and never had a problem with 
my first one. I ended up haveing a new 
navigation system, a whole new computer 
and ect. put in my car after 300 miles. 
Acura did take care of me by giving me 
a car to drive in the mean time, but it 
just wasn't the same. Now, everythings 
okay just got off to a bad start."
acura,mdx,2004,susieqz, 11/18/2003,Awsome Car!,pos,"This car has got to be the best I have 
ever owned.  I love everything about 
it.  It drives like a dream.  The sound 
system is great.  The cabin is quiet.  
The seats are comfortable.  It does 
just as advertised on gas mileage--even 
when using less than premium.  It has 
every gadget I could ever want. "
acura,mdx,2004,mchen007, 11/24/2003,King of the hill.,pos,"The best SUV on the market.  This is 
our second MDX in the family.  We laso 
have a 2002 MDX Tour & Nav and was 
extremely happy.  That's why we went 
out and got another one.  We purchased 
the 2004 MDX tour, nav, and dvd ent in 
aspen pearl white.  Amazingly, 
honda/acura managed to improve on 
previous models with more power, 
smoother ride, better handling, and 
sportier design.  And the numerous toys 
to play with inside amaze me.  Great 
suv!!  They managed to squeeze four 
disc players into the suv (Nav DVD 
player, 6 disc cd changer, single disc 
in dash cd player, and DVD movie 
player... Awesome. Oh yeah, rear view 
camera is cool too."
acura,mdx,2004,shannon williams, 11/29/2003,I love my MDX,pos,"The MDX is an excellent SUV.  The rear 
view camera is great for me when 
parking and the Navigation system is so 
easy to understand and use.  The MDX 
gives you a comfortable ride, with 
seating capacity of seven adults, 
thanks to third row seat.  The sound 
system is very enjoyable.  My only 
regret now is that I did not get the 
DVD Entertainment System."
acura,mdx,2004,bigJoe, 11/19/2003,2004 Acura MDX Fast & Fun,pos,"  The Acura with Mitsu tires drives 
like a dream.  The unit is quiet, 
starts and accelerates very quickly 
and smoothly.  I liked the fact that 
it's the only SUV with the governments 
ultra clean engine certification.  The 
other thing I like about acura is 
there's only a few options.. most 
eveything is standard. Dual exhaust 
looks sharp I got the optional side 
boards for an added touch. excellent 
paint and fit and a standard sunroof 
are a plus. Front wheel drive with 
auto 4 wheel makes it sure footed in 
slipery weather."
acura,mdx,2004,jehmd, 11/20/2003,almost perfect,pos,"Everything is great with my 04 mdx 
except one annoying problem. Excessive 
muffler noise @ low RPM."
acura,mdx,2004,Acura Lover, 11/22/2003,The Greatest SUV I've Ever Owned,pos,"Better than the X5 I used to own.  
We're planning to get a second one 
when my wife's Volvo X70 lease is up.  
The kid's love the room and enjoy the 
option of having their own row with 
the seven passenger seating. The 
performance and handling on the MDX is 
like a fine performance car.  The four 
wheel drive is seemless and the gas 
mileage blows my former X5 away.
I had to wait for the MDX since it's 
the most popular SUV in it's class, 
but trust me, it's so worth it.  
Dollar for dollar, you just can't beat 
it.  It has features that come 
standard that the X5 just couldn't 
touch. If you're in NJ, definitely go 
to DCH Montclair Acura."
acura,mdx,2004,Blades, 11/23/2003,Best SUV in class,pos,"This is the best SUV on the market, 
feature for feature, dollar for 
dollar!  There are more expensive 
SUV's!  SUV's with more snob appeal, 
but that don't feed the Bulldog!  They 
cannot carry hardly anything 
internally or compare with the Honda's 
ULEV motor!  I would not trade mine 
which I use as a commercial vehicle 
for any other SUV on the market!"
acura,mdx,2004,ovation00, 12/05/2003,2004 MDX w/ Nav,pos,"It's been about 3 wks since I pick up 
my 04 mdx. The engine has just broken 
in and I started pushing it more. This 
vehicle drives, handles quite well and 
is quite. I like the easy-to-use 
buttons and simple interior. It looks 
wonderful with satin finish side step, 
rear spoiler, and wide side moldings. 
There are a couple of glitches to be 
fixed such as faulty tire pressure 
light (TPMS) and low clicking sound 
from the break pedal."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXFAN, 12/06/2003,5 scouts,pos,"Comfort and fun.  Taking 54 scouts and 
gear can be a tough.  The MDX with the 
Nav and entertainment keeps everyone 
occupied. I added a Thule gear box for 
snowboards, tents, skis etc.  Gas 
milege is better than expected.  
Averages 20 MPG, goes anywhere offroad 
I need to go.  "
acura,mdx,2004,MDX04, 12/11/2003,2004 MDX - Love it,pos,"Only problem was noise from the nash 
after 100 miles.  Dealer found problem 
and fixed it right away.   Great ride, 
feels like a car.  Fuel economy is less 
than with a car, but that is expected 
when purchasing an SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2004,david94134, 12/12/2003,2004 Acura MDX review,pos,Excellent SUV and best in its class.
acura,mdx,2004,minnie, 07/08/2005,Couldn't ask for more.,pos,"Good acceleration, extremely stable handling, slightly less poorer milage than expected, excellent fit and finish.  This car has been extremely reliable and has amazing safety statistics."
acura,mdx,2004,nll, 12/15/2003,The interior should be higher qlty.,pos,"I have enjoyed owning and driving this 
car. It's a great vehicle. My 
disappointments are in the suggested 
improvements section. Paying sticker 
was painful. The gas mileage could be 
better. I get 17/mpg. Defrost gives 
off a musty smell in summer."
acura,mdx,2004,Rizwan Malik, 12/21/2003,Simply awesome.....,pos,"  I bought MDX yesterday and it is 
simply awesome with tons of safety 
features, state of the art gadgets and 
a silky smooth engine. Plenty of room 
and an axcellent DVD and Navigation 
system. I feel this SUV is much better 
than the lexus GX470, BMW X5, VW 
Touareg and Mercedes ML, as I test 
drove all of them in one day and Acura 
was the winner...well done Acura!"
acura,mdx,2004,rtcxyz, 12/24/2003,Great Car,pos,"Extremely well designed. Excellent 
build quality. Classy and functional 
interior. Accelerates and corners 
beautifully, rides great. We evaluated 
the Lexus RX330, BMW X5, Volvo XC90 but 
the MDX was the clear choice. Only bad 
news is due to high demand/quality, the 
dealers aren't willing to negotiate 
from MSRP. At least they are no longer 
adding a premium over MSRP."
acura,mdx,2004,bengt, 12/27/2003,I looked for safety and comfort,pos,"Safety was the pime component as I 
shopped for a new SUV.  The MDX has the 
safety features I was looking for. I 
was also looking for comfort, style and 
a navigation system. I looked at other 
brands, but the MDX was the one which 
met my needs.  Other luxury brands in 
this size car didn't offer the third 
seat; they also had smaller cargo 
areas.  The navigation system is a 
fantastic addition; the rear camera 
used when the car is in reverse, is 
also a great feature.  I love the car!"
acura,mdx,2004,Bharat, 12/27/2003,a good vehicle,pos,Love it. No Regrets.
acura,mdx,2004,mamardo, 12/27/2003,we love this car,pos,"We have just purchased this vehicle, 
but love the way it rides, looks and 
reacts to your every move. The interior 
is very luxious and comfortable and has 
so many wonderful features. It is great 
to travel with children or dogs as each 
seat has comfort and spacious. I would 
reccomned it highly!"
acura,mdx,2004,Kadepp, 12/27/2003,I love my Acura MDX,pos,"I LOVE MY CAR! I drive 1.5 hours to 
work and again back home -- at the end 
of the day I am disappointed when it is 
time to pull into the garage because 
the ride has been so great and I am not 
dog tired from sitting in the driver's 
seat until 7 pm."
acura,mdx,2004,quicksale, 12/27/2003,Fantastic!,pos,"With the NAV System, the Acura MDX is 
incredible.  A Great SUV!"
acura,mdx,2004,Bob A, 12/27/2003,Great SUV,pos,Rides as good as  my Lincoln.
acura,mdx,2004,Kevin Roberson, 12/29/2003,Our MDX,pos,"Great SUV. Overall best SUV for the 
money. We like it even better than out 
Lexus lx470"
acura,mdx,2004,Tofer, 12/29/2003,Awesome Luxury SUV,pos,"We looked at 5 other SUV's before we 
settled on the MDX, including the BMW, 
VW Touareg, Highlander, Pilot and the 
Lexus RX330.  In the end we picked the 
MDX for the best combination of luxury, 
ride, and price.  The MDX offers a very 
quiet ride - but is still very 
responsive and a lot of fun to drive. 
The styling is in our opinion the 
best.  The interior is very well laid 
out and we found this to be the most 
comforable of all the SUV's we drove.  
While we won't use the 3rd row seats 
very often, it is nice to have the 
extra seating available."
acura,mdx,2004,BAV, 12/30/2003,Great so far,pos,"Purchased Sage Brush Pearl w/ touring 
package 11/03, only 500+ miles so far.  
Ride and handling are great.  Also test 
drove Murano and it was more fun/sporty 
but felt MDX was more solid, much nicer 
interior, and proven long-term 
reliability, and 2004 changes were 
right on (side curtain air bags, slight 
body modifications, interior display).  
Also thought about 4runner but 
preferred MDX compromise of eco-
friendly V6, great cargo and seating 
space, luxury options, and safety. "
acura,mdx,2004,rizwan malik, 01/03/2004,awesome!,pos,"i bought it few weeks ago and this is 
an awesome SUV, much beter than the 
Lexus GX470,volvo XC90,BMW X5 or 
mercedes ML500. well built and an 
excelent ride quality. very smooth and 
powerful"
acura,mdx,2004,my, 01/03/2004,nice SUV with bland style,pos,"very good SUV overall in terms of 
reliability, but style is bland and not 
exciting.   "
acura,mdx,2004,dlewin, 01/04/2004,Best SUV for the $,pos,"Our '04 has about 1000 miles on it now 
and it's been great.  The ride is as 
quiet and smooth as most luxury sedans 
and the handling is better than most 
SUV's I've driven.  Build quality is 
very high as well.  The DVD is great 
for the kids - we can go for hours 
without a single tantrum!  And the Nav 
has proven more useful than we expected 
as we have used it to quickly find 
restaurants and tourist attractions.  I 
really wouldn't change much anout this 
SUV!"
acura,mdx,2004,sunshineks, 01/10/2004,Best Car I Ever Drove,pos,"My Acura MDX is the most comfortable 
and easy driving car I have ever had.  
I do alot of highway driving and the 
MDX almost drives itself.  It is very 
quiet and smooth.  I will never go back 
to driving a smaller car again."
acura,mdx,2004,DonMclRPI, 01/11/2004,Lots to like; easy to be with.,pos,"This is by far the most comfortable 
vehicle I have ever driven. Everything 
manages to be in the right place to 
find it and the little features of 
automation really work to make the 
driving pleasant.

The heating system, while short of all 
the buttons, knobs and zones of some 
others, simply works. I (we) seldome 
change any setting, save the back seat 
control to allow passengers their say

The second seats are the surprise.... 
they recline.

Backing up with the camera is 
surprising. Try it in a pitch dark 
situation to really surprise yourself.

And, six though it is, it goes!

My advice .... drive this ""bland"" SUV a 
few miles before you buy anything else. "
acura,mdx,2004,BacktoAcura, 01/12/2004,BacktoAcura,pos,"Drove SUVs for years. Wanted a 
more ""car-like"" & better refinement.
Drove Infiniti FX...RX 330...Hylander
MDX was the best value & refinement for
the $$. Turned in my QX4...tired of the
bumpy ride & cramped quarters. MDX
superior ride...engine...interior..etc.
Acura's quality & in my case...""Welcome

was refreshing!"
acura,mdx,2004,MDXDriver, 01/13/2004,MDX,pos,"Great, realiable, comfortable car, no

very responsibly. I might've enjoyed a

altogether, the MDX indeed is a 
luxurious SUV."

acura,mdx,2004,annalisa, 01/24/2004,04baseMDX-SO HAPPY I OWN ONE,pos,"I've been eyeing this vehicle for
several months and did a lot of
research. dealerships were competitive
but got the best deal at 35,300 with
side steps!-excl.tax and license. love
the vehicle and look forward to driving
it all the time. i just wish gas
consumption was a lot better even though
that's a given with an suv."
acura,mdx,2004,redwaller, 01/26/2004,MDX,pos,"One year and 9000 miles have been
reasonable, I find that there is more
than usual hunting for gears(between 4th
and 5th)even on mildly slopy roads.
(2) Our dealership services are shameful
they use recycled engine oil that too
not the recommended SAE 5-20 but 5-30.
For next simple oil change I will try DIY. "

acura,mdx,2004,DebbieM, 01/21/2004,Love my MDX!,pos,"I am not a car enthusiasist, but I love 
the MDX!  Drove it 1600 miles shortly 
after getting it & it performed well & 
was very comfortable (even for my 6'5"" 
husband who hates cramped spaces).  I 
like it too because although it is 
attractive -- it isn't showy.  We've 
never owned an Acura before, but I 
suspect this is not our last one!  (PS -
our golden retriver loves any vehicle, 
but our little ""uppity"" dogs even love 
it!)"
acura,mdx,2004,PC MDX, 12/29/2005,2 Years of Flawless Ownership,pos,"I have to admit. This is my first SUV, and it is the best on the market by far. I have had no issues, no complaints, and dealer service as been good as well. Buyers of SUV's should evaluate before purchasing, since it took me 3 months to decide between the Lexus RX, the MDX, and the Pilot. The MDX has the best overall performance, features, turning radius and off road ability as comparable to the Pilot. If a person would like to have simple styling, then go with the Pilot. Better exterior styling then go with the MDX, which was the deciding factor for me. "
acura,mdx,2004,foodie, 01/31/2004,Fab SUV,pos,"My new MDX is the most wonderful car.  
I enjoy it more then any other car I

is safe, reliable, beautiful and 
handles like a dream."
acura,mdx,2004,Strong, 01/31/2004,MDX,pos,"Best vechicle I have ever owned. 
Pleasant to drive, good visability. The 
Nav system is wonderful - never ben 
lost since I have satrted using it. "
acura,mdx,2004,GMZ, 01/03/2006,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"We purchased our 2004 MDX w/touring new for 41 grand(about $900 under MSRP). It has been a wonderful vehicle, with a powerful engine, a spacious, functional, and quality built interior. It is very family friendly, with a complaint ride and many cupholders and storage areas. The driving dynamics are also impressive, with balanced steering (though not X5 level) and sporty handling. I have just 1 problem with the MDX. It's interior may be high quality, but lacks some of the classy-look of the BMW X5. The AWD will make for a sure friend, and the MDX handles much better on snow than Lexus RX330. Throw in a bargain price, and it's easily a better buy than the X5, RX, or Pilot which I test drove."
acura,mdx,2004,Nice Vehicle, 01/06/2006,Great Vehicle,pos,"Very satisfied owner after 18 months.  Great combination of utility, quality, performance, and reliability.  Recently completed a long holiday trip in inclement weather, which highlighted this vehicle's value proposition---car handled great, giving the driver (me) reassuring confidence, while four other family members stretched out comfortably to snooze, leaving room to spare for holiday luggage/gifts.  No regrets thus far on this purchase.    "
acura,mdx,2004,fred, 01/22/2006,2004 acura mdx,pos,"The MDX is exactly what it purports to be, an extremely reliable, attractive, solid SUV with a well laid out, good looking interior and exterior, good handling, a wonderful driving feel, a first rate navigation system and mediocre gas mileage (but it's an SUV so what did you expect!)  I'd buy another, although I'm particularly interested in the new, smaller Acura SUV promised for later this year - so long as it's not too small.  Typical Honda quality."
acura,mdx,2004,Andyrew, 02/16/2004,Its excellent,pos,"I have a 2003 MDX it is ecxellent. I 
love it very much, and i am happy with 
it. Although after a while sitting on 
it it isnt so comfortable. And if your 
haul around all of the seven it can fit 
its not so comfortable."
acura,mdx,2004,EVP, 02/16/2004,THE BEST,pos,"THIS IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED

BETTER THAN THE CADDY.
GREAT PICK UP,ACCELERATION AND HANDLES 
LIKE A SPORTS CAR."
acura,mdx,2004,Abigail, 02/18/2004,Acura Review,pos,"Overall handling/comfort is great. Rear 
(3rd row) seat is more for kids or 
cargo and not made for adults. Highway 
accelaration noise is a bit excessive 
and annoying, just boost up the 
dynamite sound system to drown it out."
acura,mdx,2004,asharkov, 02/18/2004,Please reduce the exhaust noise,pos,"Before buying my 2004 MDX, I took a
test-drive in Mercedes ML350 and Volvo
XC90, and I liked the MDX much better
then either of them. I like the MDX's 
acceleration and power, as well as
luxury features, like the navigation
system and rear-view camera. What I do
not like, is a low-pitch noise coming
from either muffler, or some other part
of the exhaust system at around 2000
rpms, or at about 70-72 mi/h. If you
keep the car running at that speed for a
while, the noise becomes very annoying.  "

spaciousness, esp. of the back when 
shopping. Truly enjoy the ride, the 
interior design and all the features. 
Test drove many SUV's before we bought 
and have no second thoughts on 
purchase.Almost bought a Honda Pilot, 
but felt for a few more dollars, the 
MDX gave you alot more. Other SUV's 
(X5, Toureg, Land Rover) much more 
overpriced for what you get. "

blown away how amazeing this suv was. 
When the mdx first came out in 01 i 
knew that that was the suv that i 
wanted... I went to baysore acura and 
said i was the siver mdx, I didn't even 
test drive it once.... Just knowing the 
reputation of honda i knew it would be 
an amazeing SUV. I've had it since 2002 
and not one problem with the mdx, and i 
now have 40,000.   I recomed this suv

nothing can be done about it at this
time, and only if Acura gets enough
complaints, it may look at the problem,
and find a fix."
acura,mdx,2004,Anthony Tallo, 02/28/2004,Acura in Valley Park Mo.,pos,"The car is incredible.  I traded in a 
jeep liberty because our family needed 
more room - boy did we get it!
The car seats 7 comfortably - key is no 
wheel well in second row!
The dvd is outstanding quaility and the 
navigation sytem is reliable and 
efficient.
The car handles like a dream...the cars 
turning radius is supurb!
And the camera when the car is in 
reverse is a life saver!"
acura,mdx,2004,Edkristin, 02/29/2004,"Mildly disappointed, horrible mileage",pos,"I had expected a positive experience 
in the switch from my Volvo V70 to the 
MDX. 
The MDX still had its share of initial 
defects, from a poorly fitting & hard 
to close rear hatch to missing 
hardware on the front center consol 
box.  
The mileage is atrocious.  I'm getting 
11.9 all-around mileage against an 
advertised 18-22.  It must be a larger 
issue, because someone stopped my wife 
in a parking lot the other day to ask 
how bad her mileage was (he had the 
same problem).
In retrospect, I'd take the Volvo 
Cross-Country over the MDX any day, if 
only my 3 kids under 6 and their 
friends fit in one!"

better not using it, nav map somewaht 
time dated. 2nd one I've owned & will 
probally do it again!"
acura,mdx,2004,iquilt6, 02/29/2004,2004 Acura MDX,pos,"Best SUV I test-drove.  Competition was 
the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander 
and the MDX beat them both hands down.  
It has a smooth, comfortable ride, very 
car-like due to the chassis.  I wanted 
a third-row because I sometimes haul 
grandchildren, and I wanted that third-
row to be comfortable.  The 
Highlander's third row seat seemed like 
an afterthought, and not a very good 
one at that.  The Pilot would have been 
a good choice, but Honda would not put 
a tan interior in a white exterior -- 
VERY shortsighted in my opinion.  I am 
thrilled with the MDX -- it just keeps 
getting better."
acura,mdx,2004,dirthead, 02/29/2004,get one,pos,"nice looking inside and out. terrible on
fuel economy is worse than 8 cyl.
jeep...engine looks really cool....a
little sluggish from0- 50 ,,,,,off road
isnt too good, could have  more

comfortable ride and plenty of room,,and
plenty of cup holders. Dont misplace

battery dies ,,youll hve no music"
acura,mdx,2004,Jimrayoden, 03/02/2004,Bluetooth-enabled,pos,"I test drove an MDX with Navigation 
and was really impressed.  My question 
is for existing owners as to whether 
this model has the Handsfreelink 
(bluetooth) feature that the TL has 
which allows you to use a Bluetooth 
enabled phone to work with the car?  
On the TL, you can dial phone numbers 
in your Navigation database using your 
(bluetooth-enabled) cell phone.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Frustrated MDX, 03/03/2004,Disappointed MDX Owner,pos,"This car continues to spend more time 
at the dealership.Have had both 
headlights replaced due to design flaw 
& moisture getting inside. Lever on 
middle row seat broke.Finish on 
steering wheel cover started to come 
off.Recall for timing belt.Design flaw 
with the brake calipers & the constant 
clicking noise. Design flaw with the 
gas tank & constance sloshing sound of 
gas. The latest was the breaking of the 
power steering pulley belt that left my 
wife stranded on a LA freeway in the 
rain at night.It took Acura's roadside 
service 3 hours to finally get her 
towed.Acura's thanks to us was giving 
us a crappy Ford Focus for a loaner.  
All this for a $44k SUV."

this vehicle.  "

automotive industry- yet we do not

vehicle- I would highly suggest buyers 
to see the value and luxury you 
recieve from the mdx."
acura,mdx,2004,Catchey, 03/17/2004,Japanese Waning,pos,"ACURA is one of the disappointing 
vehicle experiences I have ever had. 
The interior is sound but the plastics 
used are soft and mar easily, numerous 
trim pieces have broken. Getting 
warranty work completed is next to 
impossible. ACURA uses a just in time 
inventory between its dealers. After 
several appointments for warranty work. 
ACURA takes the money for the service 
work and they claims to ""return"" the 
parts ordered for warranty.

The mileage rating is overstated, but 
still better than most vehicles in its 
class. Acura achieves the better than 
average rating by using the thinnest 
sheet metal ever. "
acura,mdx,2004,Jim Kurp, 03/17/2004,Not a retagged Pilot,pos,"Before purchasing I drove both the MDX 
and the Pilot. The acceleration and 
handling of the MDX were far superior 
to that of the Pilot.

It took an adjustment to move from a 
sedan to a SUV, however, the 
performance and handling of the MDX is 
comparable to my prior vehicle (98 
Volvo V70). The major difference is the 
fit/finish/quality of the MDX, which is 
far superior to that of the Volvo.

It is a vehicle I expect to own and 
enjoy for years to come."

acura,mdx,2004,John6952, 03/22/2004,Great vehicle,pos,"I've spent a lot of seat time in many

acura,mdx,2004,Robert B, 03/24/2004,Love this Acura,pos,"I LOVE this car or I mean SUV. It 
performs & drives like a car. So 
smooooooth. Great look!!! Navi is very 
nice to have but does need upgraded, 
missing a few older streets.
Breaks click kind of loud when applied 
& the shocks thump alittle when taking 
off. Not big deals but for a $45000.00 
vehicle it shouldnt be there. Leather 
could be a little softer."
acura,mdx,2004,MDX Challenge, 03/30/2004,satisfied,pos,"Test drove a good number of SUV's. This 
Acura SUV got my attention because of 
all it's safety features, good looking 
body style, very good gas mileage, good 
Bose audio sound, and nicely powered 
265 HP engine which makes it fun to 
drive with some pep. Interior audio 
controls as well as somewhat 
complicated NAV system the only knock"
acura,mdx,2004,Myque, 03/30/2004,Great SUV...not a performance car,pos,"I am happy I bought this vehicle. I 
traded a 2002 Mercedes 320C in on it. 
Thus, I realize the ride will not be a 
performance car ride...and I also 
understand this vehicle has a lot to 
offer for the $. The ride is a little 
bumpy, but the pick up, goodies added 
and over-all comfort more than make up 
for that. I compared the Lexus RX330 to 
this and thought both were great. 
However, this ride was more for the $."
acura,mdx,2004,Vixx MDX, 03/31/2004,Love my MDX,pos,"I had the Honda Pilot (which is a great

I decided to get the MDX.  Best ride 
I've ever had. :o)"

now and are very happy with the overall 
performance, fit and finish.  We 
considered teh MDX, X3, Lexux 330, and 
the Sequoia.  Overall value, 
reliability, conform of ride, power 
plant, third row seat and storage made 
the MDX an easy choice for us."
acura,mdx,2004,Goldee, 04/02/2004,Love it,pos,"I love my beautiful new car. I love 
the way it looks and handles.  I want 
to keep this car until I pay it off.  
I've never said that before."
acura,mdx,2004,smc2103, 04/05/2004,My analysis after 2 weeks.,pos,"Got my 04 MDX about 2 weeks ago. I am 
getting about 20.5 mpg (mostly 
highway, some local) on average so 
far. I am happy with this average as 
my 96 TL was giving only about 2 miles 
more.

I have no sloshing issue, however the 
2K RPM humming sound is there. 
However, I have learnt to ignore it, 
and doesn't bother me too much.

Other than that really loving the 
drive! Would have loved Acura to place 
some light over the coin tray! "
acura,mdx,2004,Paul, 07/09/2006,Paul's Acura MDX Driving impressions,pos,"The 2004 Acura MDX Touring with Entertainment system has been one of the best vehicles I've owned in any class and absolutely the best SUV to date. Comfort, reliability, ergonomics and a lot better than average SUV handling hi-light its many features."
acura,mdx,2004,Goli, 04/07/2004,Reliability>Safety>Quality>Value,pos,"3.3K. I am happier with it every day. 
QUALITY- no a rattle/squeak. Great 
leather. PERFORMANCE- fast, powerful, 
effortless. SUSPENSION-comparable SUVs 
are either too soft or too stiff, MDX 
has perfectly balanced a comfortable 
ride with very good HANDLING. UTILITY 
useful ample space, turn seating for 7 
into open flush space in just seconds. 
My dogs love this vehicle (BTW- the 
optional CARGO LINER is a must-have 
(tailor-made for the MDX protects 
interior from dogs, bikes, scuba gear, 
etc). COMFORT-very quiet (although some 
wind noise at very high speeds), 
comfortable, and great seats. AC is 
great! SE FL resident on a Black/Black."

acura,mdx,2004,Acura lover, 04/08/2004,Acura's MDX is the best SUV available,pos,"This is my second MDX.  It is the most 
comfortable and luxerious SUV I've 
ever owned.  Everything in it (besides 
the DVD and Navigation System) is 
standard.  There are no dealer ""add-
on's"".  This includes the leather 
seats, the seat heaters, moonroof, 
side curtain air bags, 6 CD changer, 
premium sound system, and premium 
paint job.  The MDX rides as smooth or 
smoother than any car I have ridden 
in.  The 265 HP engine climbs 
mountains without any hesitation."
acura,mdx,2004,Liza Cruz, 04/13/2004,My Acura MDX 2004,pos," Having search for many months for a 
SUV, I decided on the MDX, the price 
was right, 1st and formost, the vehicle 
was what I wanted, the performance was 
great, the safety features where 
excellent, this SUV is great."
acura,mdx,2004,mking, 04/08/2004,It's mine and I love it,pos,"I had one of the first MDX's (2001) off 
the line.  My husband always borrowed 
it when it rained hard or snowed.  When 
he asked what I wanted for a holiday 
gift, I said I a car he could drive in 
bad weather without taking mine.  Just 
before Christmas we bought our 2nd MDX--
one for me, and he took over the 2001 
MDX.
We had a hard winter here, with lots of 
snow--and we each loved having our own 
MDX!
I enjoy the upgrades:  265 hp, rearview 
scan in reverse, 
automatic windshield wipers, and 
automatic lights.  The new navi system 
is slightly more difficult to use, but 
has more features.  I feel safe, and I 
am glad he is safe, too."

acura,mdx,2004,tbooth2, 04/18/2004,"Had the rest, now own the best",pos,"Been through six cars since 1993, last 
vehicle was repurchased from mfg as a 
lemon.  I have to say this is the best 
so far.  Of course, the technology has 
gotten better, but this car combines 
the best of SUV/auto and sacrifices 
little except for gas mileage.  Great 
acceleration, quiet and solid with no 
squeaks/rattles or cheezy interior 
plastics. The stock rims are a little 
lame for the this price bracket, but 
they kind of grow on you and won't 
attract too much attention.  Even with 
few suggestions for improvements, we 
are very pleased with our purchase and 
would recommend this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,Quiet Please, 04/20/2004,"Love it, but a little disappointed",pos,"My 2004 is great! The ride, luxury, and 
roominess are better than any other I 
tried.  However, unexpectedly it is the 
noisiest quiet vehicle.  It is 7 months 
and it has the following noises: front 
caliper pop, rear breaks make a clunk 
noise when I change direction, they 
also make a loud rubbing noise during 
the first 10 min. of operation every 
day (all of this according to the 
dealer is normal).  The NAV system 
controls on the steering wheel dont 
work 20% of the time.  All this is not 
to say that I dont like my MDX.  I do 
like it very much.  Its just not 
perfect, which for the money I would 
have expected it to come a little 
closer."
acura,mdx,2004,Bourdeau, 04/21/2004,Happy owner,pos,"Have owned various Acuras since the 
1986 Legend and they all have been good 
for 150,000 miles plus.  Reliability is 
a big factor.  The current MDX replaces 
a Ford Explorer, 1999 and the change is 
monumental.  There are a few areas 
where the interior could be a little 
more user friendly, but overall, it is 
a joy to drive."
acura,mdx,2004,bri32974, 05/03/2004,Great Ride,pos,"I've had the vehicle for about 3 weeks 
now.  Love the ride.  It just feels 
like your driving a nice vehicle when 
driving.  All my family and friends 
love it.  I did research for about 3 
months.  Test drove alot of different 
SUV's.  The decision came down to 
either the MDX or Volkswagen Toureg.  
For the money, I thought the MDX beat 
it out.  The history of reliability and 
resale is pretty good compared to some 
of the other competitors.  I'm 
averaging about 18 to 19 miles on the 
average.  Definitely, get the side 
steps and luggage rack on the vehicle.  
That finishes off the look of the 
vehicle.  It kind of looks naked 
without it.  "
acura,mdx,2004,bmartys, 05/08/2004,"Totaled 3 month old, bought another",pos,"I totaled our 3 month old MDX at 75mph 
on the interstate. It flipped end over 
end twice across the median into 
oncoming traffic. We opted to get 
another MDX because I think I would 
have been dead in anything else even 
though none of the airbags deployed."

and Infiniti Fx 45. For the price, 
safety features and options that I 
wanted (esp. 3rd seat option), the 
Acura MDX 2004 was the Only choice. 
The Acura offers the best performance,

standards and options.  Radio system is 
excellent.  Best car that we have ever 
had!  And the wife is picky!"
acura,mdx,2004,cathy e, 05/24/2004,love it love it,pos,"I just purchased this car 1 week ago 
and so far I am totally thrilled with 
it. It drives like a dream, smoothe and 
effortless. The acceleration is quick 
and the breaks reactive. I especially 
love the sound system. The 
entertainment package comes with Bose 
speakers and the sound is incredible. 
Also, the kids are loving the DVD 
system It's a classy, beautiful, luxury 
SUV and I am a happy(beaming) new owner~"
acura,mdx,2004,Redfern, 05/25/2004,Built to last,pos,"This is my second MDX.  My first one 
performed exceptionally well.  Interior 
road noise was evident. The 2004 has 
improved markedly in many respects.  
Handling, ride, and horsepower. Better 
fuel economy is edvident. The vehicle 
is superbly engineered. While the 
brakes are excellent,  The 2001 wass 
superior."
acura,mdx,2004,cdorider, 05/22/2004,Best SUV I have owned,pos,"I have owned 2 suv's before this one 
and after owning my 4Runner I thought 
no other suv in this price range would 
come close, but the MDX changed my 
mind.his is an awsome suv. "
acura,mdx,2004,VirginiaBlues, 05/22/2004,Dream SUV,pos,"Having only had this vehicle for less 
than a month, some of my opinions could 
change.  However, at this point in the 
game it is without a doubt the finest 
vehicle I have ever driven, including 
the Lexus, Cadillac, Jags and BMW's.
I frequently put 50k miles per year on 
vehicles, so this was a consideration 
when choosing Acura.  The resale on 
Acura's is extremely high, and talk to 
anyone who has ever had one; they LOVE 
them.
After reading Consumer Reports rate it, 
I knew I couldn't go wrong."
acura,mdx,2004,minnie999, 05/29/2004,Probably best SUV for today,pos,"Performance has been excellent except

manufacturing defects."
acura,mdx,2004,ACSInc., 06/01/2004,Acura 04,pos,"We took this vehicle from Coatesville, 
PA to Portland Maine right out of the 
box.  It performed perfectly.  The 
Nav. system came in real handy when 
our son's flight was cancelled and we 
went from Portland ME to Boston to 
pick him up.$41500 including 6% PA. 
sales tax. Not cheap but worth it.  
You sit higher than the mini van but 
the ride is stiffer. "
acura,mdx,2004,carl555, 05/31/2004,mdx ride,pos,"Recently, I woke up late for my flight. 
It entailed a fast ride to the 
airport.At speeds of 80-90 mph I really 
experienced the true handling of this 
vehicle.It was pure peformance. The 
engine purred and the ride was tight 
and really tracked to the road. For an 
SUV it was unbelievable. This really is 
a great vehicle."
acura,mdx,2004,TNMDX, 06/02/2004,Love my MDX,pos,"We purchased our MDX out of state to 
get a better deal and enjoyed trying 
out the navigation and DVD in a new 
city and on a long trip.  The 
navigation was wonderful and helped us 
get around the city with ease.  Also, 
the restaurant locator was excellent.  
The rest stop finder is nice too.  If 
you travel, the navigation feature is a 
must-have!  The DVD is nice too.  Very 
solid in the ceiling and doesn't block 
the driver's rear view as much as some 
other models.  The ride quality is 
excellent.  The seats are comfortable 
and it has good room in the 2nd row.  
We have two carseats in the back seat 
and I can still sit very comfortably 
between the two seats.  "
acura,mdx,2004,Bootstau, 06/07/2004,Better than our Lexus,pos,"The MDX has surpased my expectations. 
The ride is quite and extemely 
comfortable. We had a Lexus RX 300 and 
it was smaller and did not have the 
same power. It handles great and has 
surprising excelleration.The interior 
is set up great. Plenty of room even in 
the third row seats."
acura,mdx,2004,gohogsgo, 06/08/2004,Just Love It.......,pos,"We purchased a loaded MDX last October 
and have loved everything almost 
everything about it.  The only thing 
that has gone wrong with the car is one 
of the headlight bulbs burned out at 6k 
miles.  Of course this was under 
warranty but a hassel none the less.  
It is a fun car to drive. The kids just 
love the dvd and we love the headphones!

Another thing I should mention is that 
the nav system isn't as current as I 
would have expected.  The neighborhood 
that we live in was built in 1999 and 
is not in the system.  Also my office 
which has been open since 1997 isn't in 
there either.  The software could use 
some updating."
acura,mdx,2004,Michael Norwich, 06/13/2004,Never Better,pos,"The MDX has very good gas mileage for 
the type of SUV.It's very practical 
and nice. Its as comfortable as any 
other car. I love it. The car could 
use a better bumper for door dings, 
though."
acura,mdx,2004,The Donahue Family, 06/18/2004,The BEST experience!!!,pos,"We just purchased our 04 MDX we love

acura,mdx,2004,olie, 06/23/2004,My MDX,pos,"Absolutely the best I have bought. I 
was originally going to purchase a BMW

It has more features and creature 
comforts at no extra charge. I also was 
impressed with its handling ability at 
higher speeds.  "
acura,mdx,2004,A. Montano, 06/17/2004,#1 SUV on the road!,pos,"The MDX is the best SUV out on the

a Honda (a great car) to the Acura 
MDX.  It's not only reliable, nice 
looking but the best SUV on the road 
not only for moms but for anyone 
interested in an SUV.  I have test 
driven other SUV's and the MDX is the 
perfect size.  It's not too big and not 
too small.  Plus it is considered one 
of the safest SUV's out there.  It 
can't get any better than that."
acura,mdx,2004,cheri loyd, 06/24/2004,Love my Red Rock MDX,pos,"Only complaint? It's difficult to 
thoroughly clean front seat interior 
area around the ""cracks""-near gear 
shift,cup holder and door panels.  I am 
very pleased with gas mileage-I have 
gotten over 23MPG on the highway twice.
Probably would have been 25 if I had 
kept it down to 55.

great acceleration (but feels slow), 
slight wind noise (but 200% better than 
my Integra), simple instrumentation, 
slightly wider than I would have liked

awesome, smooth ride.  What else can I 
say....so far, I really like it.
I waited until the last day of June to 
buy.  On the last day of the month, all 
Acura dealers dropped their prices to 
at least $500 over invoice.  I paid 
invoice price, plus they threw-in a 
decor package."
acura,mdx,2004,Bill San Diego, 07/09/2004,Fix those brakes!,pos,"We love this car! Great flexibilty 
with the seats in the back and we 
don't have to worry about fitting into 
parking spaces like Yukon owners.  
Great engine and the sound system is 
great!  The only complaint is the damn 
clicking in the brakes..what is the 
deal with that?!?!

We didn't want to pay what U.S. 
dealers were charging so we bought it 
for less including shipping to our 
house in San Diego by buying it from a 
Canadian dealership.  NO PROBLEMS and 
we get the daytime running lights."
acura,mdx,2004,Mom13, 07/10/2004,Acura MDX,pos,"This is a wonderful car to own...so 
comfortable...rides more like a car 
than an SUV.

Spacious inside...not crammnped...a 
delight!!"
acura,mdx,2004,gilljacr, 07/10/2004,Best car I ever bought,pos,"The car is wonderful. Our only regret 
is not spending the extra money on the 
touring model. This car drives like a 
dream"
acura,mdx,2004,JHCleveland, 07/12/2004,Excellent SUV,pos,"We have had the Acura MDX for 8 months 
now and absolutely love it!  It has 
been a perfect car and have had 
absolutely no problems.  The only thing 
you have to be careful about is that, 
with the 265 Horsepower engine, it is 
easy to get going too fast - have to 
watch those speed limits carefully."
acura,mdx,2004,phenry, 07/14/2004,"So far, so excellent",pos,"Not gone too far yet, but so far 
everything I could hope for.  Drives 
like a Acura sports sedan and almost 
as good as my quatro Audi.  A dream on 
the highway, especially if you are 
used to driving an old fashion SUV.  
Nav system very intuitive and 
impressively accurate."
acura,mdx,2004,MDXLVR, 07/18/2004,The most for the Money,pos,"I love the MDX, It blows away the Lexus 
for the money, the Volvo has a good 
looking interior, but doesn't have any 
of the features that are available in 
the Acura.  The Nav system & the 
entertainment system are very user 
friendly & are worth the price.  It's 
the best luxury vehicle for the money."

acura,mdx,2004,deva, 07/22/2004,Made my neighbors jealous....,pos,"38,500 + tax
After researching a lot on SUVs that 
have a 3rd row option, we settled with 
the 4Runner (V8) and the MDX. After 
test driving MDX, my wife didn't like 
the rough handling of the 4Runner. 
Style and safety were our main 
concerns. MDX, being Acura's only SUV, 
they have really expended significant 
research into it. The twin exhaust and 
the VSC in the 2004 model embellishes 
the 265-hp engine. We got the silver 
with ebony interior. I recommend 
getting the all-purpose mats 
($120.00), original mats seemed to 
stick everything that falls on it. A 
good-size SUV that is stylish, 
powerful, and yet quite smooth to 
handle, but not for unpaved adventu"
acura,mdx,2004,Bob Lazarus, 07/26/2004,2004 Acura MDX,pos,"Overall this is an excellent vehicle 
that can haul an amazing amount of 
people or cargo when necessary."
acura,mdx,2004,djreid2, 07/30/2004,Solid Car,pos,"This is a great car that will last for 
a lifetime. It is cheaper than the 
lexus and roomier. The acceleration is 
very good for a SUV. The only downfalls 
are gas mileage and no in dash cd 
changer. The lexus had more options, 
but the Acura has more value"
acura,mdx,2004,MICHELEB, 07/31/2004,GREAT SUV FOR THE PRICE,pos,"WE ARE DELIGHTED WITH OUR MDX,THE 
TOURING PKG OFFERS A LOT COMPARED TO 
OTHER SUV'S WHICH CHARGE EXTRA FOR 
EVERYTHING! THE BACK WINDOW SHOULD OPEN 
TO OFFER GREATER FUNCTION AND THE BACK 
WINDOWS HAVING THE ABILITY TO ""VENT 
OPEN"" WOULD BE A NICE ADDED FEATURE. 
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE 
UPDATED AS TO CURRENT LOCATIONS, IT 
DOES NOT ALWAYS LIST ACCURATE ""PLACES"" 
TO GO. WE LOVE THE HEADSETS FOR THE 
BACK PASSENGERS, BUT AT $100 A HEADSET, 
IT ADDS UP TO EQUIP ALL OF THE RUGRATS

TRAVEL ALOT AND LOVE THE QUIET ENGINE.

headlights lost its seal, and we 
expected better initial quality."
acura,mdx,2004,Mike Schurr, 08/07/2004,Acura MDX Best of the Class,pos,"We purchased this car for my wife who 
had two Toyota Land Cruisers back to 
back for the past six years. To say the 
least she loves the MDX as do I. I may 
not be as big as a Land Cruiser but the 
build quality, performance and ride are 
exceptional. The engine is pure Honda, 
it is barely audible when running but 
when you put your foot in it the power 
is fantastic for an SUV. 

By knowing the dealer cost via Edmunds, 
visiting one dealer and getting a price 
via the net we bought the MDX for 
dealer invoice. Yes it can be done!
A great car at a great price, what more 
could one ask for."
acura,mdx,2004,terry woram, 08/11/2004,Trading up from ML320 to MDX,pos,"My previous suv was the Mercedes 
ML320.  After driving the MDX I felt 
that I was trading up to more features 
and convenience for the price.  Living 
in the DC area I can not tell you how 
amazing the GPS is.  Also, the camera 
for backing up is a great feature since 
I have young children and it is my 
greatest fear to injure someone while 
backing up."
acura,mdx,2004,philcosal, 08/12/2004,2004 MDX,pos,"Tried them all and the MDX was the 
winner.  No regrets after 8000 miles. 
Nav unit simply marvelous - can find 
about anything any where.  Update 
price a bit stiff. Only nit piks are 
driver position in respect to 
steering, girls love it the long 
legged guys find it less than ideal.  
Road noise too noticable - gets old 
after 8 hours of interstate.  Detest 
the service requirement for 
differential fluid, only available 
from Acrua/Honda no alternative found, 
they charge $60 to change - seems a 
bit pricy.  Might not have purchased 
MDX had I known this in advance.  
Don't like sold here only deals.  Live 
and learn.  4Runner next choice."
acura,mdx,2004,lovin it, 08/14/2004,Pretty Nice,pos,"After driving the car for over 800 mi, 
I've finally come to really appreciate 
the MDX.I did have a major pain in the 
butt experience (literally) after 
sitting in the traffic in LA for an 1 
1/2 hrs.  Every rear end is different, 
so this is a personal experience & u 
might not experience the same 
displeasure.  Luckily, for my glut, it 
has been broken in and the ride is 
less painful and the drive more 
pleasurable. Now, I could've bought 
the XC90 & been whistling Dixie, but 
the 10k extra, the week engine and 
lack of off road ablities...didn't sit 
well."
acura,mdx,2004,PinakinDesai, 08/16/2004,My MDX,pos,"Excellent performance overall. The only 
thing that they could improve upon is 
the wind noise. I also wish they had 
not taken away the Sun glass holder. 
Other than that excellent car. "
acura,mdx,2004,MGZ, 08/21/2004,Acura makes the best SUV,pos,"This is an excellent Suv. Only the 85K 
Range Rover compares.After test- 
driving the 
Toureag,X5,ML350,PIlot,GX470,Land 
Crusier, and XC90, the MDx was my 
choice due to having the best 
combination of on and off road 
performance,features, styling in and 
out,dashboard 
layout,prestige,reliability,and value. 
I think that I spent my 46K well(It's 
the best SUV in the segment).I love my 
Acura."

have been looking at SUV for about a 
year know and were in no rush to 
purchase one.  We have driven 
everything from the full size to the 
crossovers.  Yukon/Tahoe, Armada, 
FX35, X5, Discovery, ML350 and 
Pathfinder.  None come close to the 
value and options you get in the MDX. 
Take your time and drive them all! The 
MDX was the last SUV we looked at and 
ended up being the one!"
acura,mdx,2004,mjcw, 09/03/2004,Love this car!,pos,"After a year of researching and debating, my 
husband and I just bought this car, and 
could not be happier! The MDX is not only 
incredibly nice looking inside and out, but 
also drives like silk. There is an underlying 
reliability factor that comes from its Honda 
roots - and I feel both safe and very 
comfortable inside. We looked at the Pilot, 
Highlander, and Audi wagons and came full 
circle back to the MDX. End of the year sales 
discounts were worth the wait! Buy one - you 
won't be disappointed."

better on gas mileage, sticker stated 
17/ 23 and that is not the case it is 
more like 14.7/18. also the car is very 
sleak on the outside but would be 
better with some door gaurds so when 
others hit your door you dont end up 
with a very expensive dent. also navi 
gets stuck sometimes and you have to 
restart the car to even use the ac 
properly. and window locks are dumb 
because you cant let the passenger 
control the window without enableling 
your kids to do so to."

acura,mdx,2005,Kevin M, 09/05/2015,"Yes , the transmission is a problem",pos,"Very good Suv. Love the AWD. Felt safe going down the road, it feels like driving a tank. But, the transmission failed at 160000 and we were left stranded on the side of the road. Also, some other little issues. Used regular gas. It did a good job towing. We finally did trade it in at 200000 miles and Lindsay Acura Cols. Gave us 5000 for it. It had a lot of bumps and bruises on it from towing and parking lots. Overall a good suv if Honda would solve the transmission problems that the MDX has.
"
acura,mdx,2005,mdxer, 08/08/2010,'05 MDX,pos,"Replacing Cadillac Eldorado and more than happy with the change. The MDX had 82,000 miles when I got it,  97,000 six months later without any trouble, except with an a/c vent cover.  Early on I had the opportunity to drive for several hours in a blizzard with complete confidence. I have also had it on unimproved old logging roads with equal confidence. I would not take it where I would take a 4Runner, but I prefer cabin comforts.  The cabin is awesome and the toys are awesome. Front seats are 5 star. This is my favorite car ever.  I installed after market transmission and power steering filters as a precaution. The tranny's are suspect. I drive in D4 around town and D5 only over 60 mph."

acura,mdx,2005,MHirt1, 05/16/2015,Lots of mechanical issues,pos,"I am the original owner of my 2005 MDX, and currently have about 130,000 miles on the car.  We have had many mechanical issues with this car, including:

- failed torque converter at about 55,000 miles
- failed transmission cooler at about 85,000 miles which caused intermingling of transmission and radiator fluids - not good
- failed electrical harness unit - had to wait to get one from Germany!
- numerous suspension issues
- rust appearing on front of hood and in all four wheel wells starting at around 100,000 miles

Even my 15-year old Saab has had far fewer, and less expensive, mechanical issues.  I am not sure whether I will buy another MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,driddle, 02/06/2010,Trouble with transmission,pos,"Great car, but have had trouble with transmission. Has been replaced once already at 50000 miles, still makes hard shifts when shifting down."
acura,mdx,2005,seahawks_fan, 02/07/2013,Think b4 you buy your next Acura,pos,"Think b4 you buy your next Acura. My 05 MDX slammed and
locked its brakes while doing 40mph and
 almost killed my family. It happened three times in less than a month.
Dealership won't fix the modulator that is most likely the cause because it would
cost them $1600. The seat belt locked on my 9 month old pregnant wife's belly
and cause my other kids head to whip lash. They have had my car for over a week now and waiting on Corporate to take responsibility. It's sad that saving $1600 is more important than the lives of 6 people. Come on Acura/Honda.
Update: After having my $50,000 luxury car for a week, the decided they will only replace a $100 part called a brake switch. But they refused to replace the other problem, $1600 abs modulator. Their diagnostic computer told them both were failing parts. The service manager told me they are not wear and tear parts and should not have gone bad.
So they sent me off with my family hoping they guessed right. So now the car sits on my drive way. I refuse to put my family in danger. Had I been on the freeway or crossing our states snowy mountains, my family might not be here right now. I wouldn't be here to share this with others.
I told the claim manage than my family has bought 3 accords, two civics, Acura RL and the MDX the past 20 years, while spending over $100,000.
Yet, he said that wasn't enough of loyalty."
acura,mdx,2005,brannguyen, 05/21/2012,TRANSMISSION,pos,"I bought this from a used Honda dealership-in Marietta, GA, Aug. 2011. Was really excited to own my Acura SUV w/ 3rd row! Honda had a good reputation w/ reliability except for their transmission issue! I didn't realized it until it was too late! I had it checked out by Ed Voyles Acura-Chamblee. They said it was fine & they even did the transmission chip software recall. They found nothing wrong w/ it! They even took it upon themselves to do the FULL 105k service w/ timing belt w/ out getting my approval or trying to figure out what was wrong w/ the transmission. I was really upset! I even rode w/ them to see why it would vibrate at 50-60mph. Of course it wouldn't make that noise. "
acura,mdx,2005,kpsmith, 06/24/2010,Transmission vibrates/grinds at 35-40 mph,pos,"At approximately 30,000 miles, upon acceleration, the transmission would vibrate/grind until 45 mph.  I have found this to be a common problem on many Acura forums and there are 11 reports of this exact same problem on the National Highway Transportation and Safety (NHTSA) website.  The problem seems to be the transmission torque converter."
acura,mdx,2005,unhappykris, 01/02/2014,someone will sue Acura,pos,"second MDX, 7th Honda vehicle, last one had tranny issues, this one had the tranny noise slightly.
2012 I get a letter saying transmission software upgrade, so I took it in.
Especially in case I had tranny issues in future they would say that I had not done this upgrade they suggested.
The upgrade made the 5th gear come on at 45 MPH instead of the original 40 MPH.
This removed the noise, but, the gas consumption is terrible now as 90% of my city driving is below 45 MPH!
The should fix bad designs, not make us pay for it.
Also, I cannot prove this yet, but another ""recall software upgrade"" has disabled my Vehicle Stability Assist"".
This is NOT how a luxury make should do things!"
acura,mdx,2005,Cole Dabney, 06/07/2017,Excellent Vehicle,pos,"I have owned the car for seven years now. It had 54,000 on it when I bought it and now has 162,000. It is a pretty comfy car but can get uncomfy during long road trips. I have had zero problems with the vehicle since I purchased it. The only issue I have had is the torque converter started shuddering. Normally youd think oh typical Honda torque converter gone bad. But not the case! The fluid had not been changed since the car was new so I drained and filled the fluid once and the shudder disappeared. I did this 4 more times just to get most of the old fluid out with new genuine Honda fluid. Dont let someone tell you you need a new torque converter until you drain and fill the transmission WITH HONDA FLUID. Aside from this its been 100% reliable. I towed a 3000lb boat from Ohio to Florida at 160,000mi with zero issues. Overall I am really happy with the car.

They really made a beast with this one, i just revived a flooded tranni w/ busted radiator .. Few flushes & replacements later i still havent spent what its worth and it, honest to goodness i cant make this up, it runs. like. new @ 222,179 miles ladies and gentlemen. I could not tell you of another engine that would not only handle that kind of damage while driving with strawberry milk in my tranni oil for a week, unknowingly. Never once did it putter, squeek, squeel, tick, shake.. Just ran smooth, with a little less power. It still blows my mind that this is my daily driver now lol. I recommend this car because of its outstanding safety and reliability, not to mention cost of repairs are not an arm and a leg because they're Honda parts. (how brilliant) If i could give any advise, keep up with your maint. spend a few extra dollars to get better quality fluids/parts. Youll thank yourself later. :)

Never had a single problem in over 5 years of driving and towing, just scheduled maintenance.  Interior has everything and well designed.  I'd definitely buy a new one, but the new ones can't be towed - too bad.  I highly recommend this vehicle - great family SUV."
acura,mdx,2005,Janet, 07/18/2005,Very Disappointed in my MDX,neg,"Clunking noises that ""can't be fixed"". Said MDX just makes these noises w/ no remedy <-NOT an acceptable answer!!!  Poor design features:  no continuous visible outside temperature readout; recirculating air setting does not stay on-must be constantly re-set; Navigation system NOT user friendly.  Also, static in AM radio. Over-designed in some areas; under-designed in others. Manufacturer not willing to remedy problems.  Spent over $40,000 for a car that does not meet expectations. "
acura,mdx,2005,EWD, 08/03/2005,Built Just For Me,pos,"I am a tall driver (6'4"")and always must ""try on"" an automobile for fit in head,leg and foot room, steering wheel positioning and instrument and control visibility and convenience.  The MDX fits me almost perfectly.  I could use a little more room for my left foot, but head and leg room are great.  instruments and controls are conveniently located and visibility is excellent.  For me it has smooth acceleration, a firm but not harsh ride and a confidence building feel of the road.  Cargo space is excellent and thirdf row seating comfortable for the occasional need to transport my four grand kids and two adults.  Pleasing exterior styling that I think beats anything else on the road."
acura,mdx,2005,JCPHX, 07/26/2007,A great all-purpose SUV,pos,"Extremely comfortable, quiet ride with excellent performance.  I purchased with all the bells and whistles, including DVD with rear speaker control - perfect for long trips with kids.  Also, with two rows of seats that fold down, easily converts to a good SUV for hauling stuff.  Bluetooth for the mobile phone is now a must-have.  The voice-activated nav system seemed cool at first, but it was the one thing that didn't always perform perfectly.  Still, this is my first Acura and the best vehicle I have ever owned. "

acura,mdx,2005,JC in DC, 12/03/2010,A piece of feces wrapped in gold,neg,"Its bright and shiny on the outside and completely unreliable on the inside. The transmission failed at 71000 miles - dealer wants $4,000 to repair.  Paid $45,592 new for the vehicle and $6465 on repairs since 2005. If we pay for the transmission it will be over $10,000 - more than 22% of the original cost.  Bluetooth stopped working at 50,000 miles  Engine required $3,278 worth of repairs at 60,000 miles.  We use this car as our primary family vehicle - nothing strenuous or abusive.  I would never buy a Honda product ever again."
acura,mdx,2005,Van Sean, 04/04/2009,Rear main seal - transmission,pos,"Barely out of warranty and the rear main seal (rear crankshaft seal) failed. The sad part is I just paid off this sucker.  Transmission also started to develop problems. Replacing the rear main seal can cost upward $2000 (mostly labor) but this won't stop the other transmission related problems. I finally gave up and traded it in for a new car. This was a loss-loss situation for me.  Acura quality is falling apart. Sadly, I am not the only ones being affected by this...avoid at all cost! "
acura,mdx,2005,JP, 02/24/2009,I thought Acura/Honda's were relable?,pos,"I really liked the features of the vehicle.   Drove it one week and started hearing a ""rumbling"" noise around 30-40 mph.   Seemed like the transmission was having problems shifting.  Dealer had it for two weeks, had to rebuild the transmission and replace the torque converter.   Luckily I will have 3 years/36,000 mile warranty on the transmission.   Besides that, nothing else to complain about so far.   I thought Acura/Hondas were supposed to be very reliable?"

Nice improvments for 2005.  The one annoying problem that has been an issue for years is a brake ""thud"" when applying brakes backing up.  Seems silly that Acura can't fix an embarrassing problem after years of feedback on this.       "
acura,mdx,2005,Acura MDX, 08/18/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"I have had my MDX for 2 months. So far I love driving the car. It's comfortable and reliable. I just wish the gas milage was better. One thing that came standard with all my previous vehicles is automatic door locks when the car is being driven, which is not available on the MDX. I also would like to see keyless entry and a more sensitive automatic headlight mechanism. "
acura,mdx,2005,Frank Barton, 01/05/2005,Not Luxury Quality,pos,"Purchased new two months ago, we have
put 5000 miles on the MDX. At about 1500
miles the LCD display locked up (froze)
causing loss of the ability to use the
nav or to control the heating and air
conditioning (a real bummer when you're
lost in a strange city). After turning
the car off for approx. 1/2 hr. it
appeared that the electronics cooled off
enough to start working again.
The thermostat on the heater/air
conditioner has never worked properly
and the interior fogs up easily on humid
days.
Several other things, like loose
retaining screws on some of the external
body parts,etc. indicate a general lack
of concern for quality."
acura,mdx,2005,Ed, 05/11/2005,Borrow some minivan features,pos,"Not bad for driver, but third row passengers are very limited. Need more leg room and easy to get in/off. How about power sliding rear doors instead of traditional wings and power lift gate would be a good features to borrow from minivans. Automatic doors locking feature at the speed greater than 20 mph."
acura,mdx,2005,Jeff, 06/21/2005,Acura,pos,"We've had vehicle for 1yr and it's only been back to dealership once due to a slip in transmission. Dealer checked it out and right away they decided to replace transmission because Acura wanted to disassemble and assess. We were impressed! Great family vehicle, it's much roomier than you would think by looking at it."
acura,mdx,2005,Acura Driver, 08/19/2005,Nice Truck,pos,"I test drove many many SUV's and none could compare to the price and features of the MDX.  That's the reason I also drive a 2004 TL.  Unfortunately, the MDX is not nearly as nice as the TL.  The nav screen is smaller, no dual climate control, the buttons on the wheel dont light up, no power up and down feature for driver and passenger windows, and the stereo is anemic in comparison.  This is just nit picking, but the MDX should have the same or better features especially since it is $10K more than the TL.  Despite these very minor issues this is a great SUV.  Space and workmanship are top notch.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Weston Rowe, 01/12/2018,My MDX is a great vehicle,pos,"This is the best vehicle I've owned. Gas mileage is only 15-17 in the city but much better on the interstate, so it makes up for it. I've had no issues with this vehicle so far it's got 150k and I bought it at 130k so it's still kinda new to me, but it feels very put together and is great on the interstate.  I'm 6'3"" and I gotta say it's about 2 inches short height wise when I'm driving, If I sit all the way up the top of my vision is looking through the very bottom of the factory tint strip on the top where the rearview mirror is glued. So I'd say if you're under 6 feet tall you'll have no problems with this vehicle. Definitely recommend, and it's a unique vehicle not too many on the road because it's a fairly new model , relatively. The Japanese know what they're doing, let's face it why drive anything else when you're going to drop serious coin on a huge machine like this. I'm really glad I bought it, and takes care of everything I need without a pick-up truck payment.
"
acura,mdx,2005,Dennis in Edmonds, 01/30/2019,Keeps on Ticking!,pos,"I bought my 2005 MDX from used car lot with 150,000 miles. It sat on the lot for long time, so I picked it up for $6,000.  It was cosmetically beat up, but I wasn't afraid to own it as I have the greatest independent Japanese Auto mechanic.  He said it was mechanically sound.   I'm retired, so I've had time to upgrade:  Suspension, Running Boards, Catalytic Converters, all  LED Lights, Window Regulator, Starter, all dents removed,  reupholstered front seat bottoms myself. It now looks and drives really nice!   It now has 173,000 miles and I've spent a total of $5,000 in maintenance repairs and upgrades.  This SUV hums along like a Japanese Clock!  This is my 3rd MDX of this series (2001 to 2006). Frankly, I occasionally think of getting something sexier or newer, but you just cannot beat the reliability and comfort of this vehicle. Plus, the interior of this SUV is huge.  The newer ones were reduced in size and I don't like the style as much.   I know that my honest mechanic will keep me on the road no matter what. However,  I recommend that everyone should buy  a OBD2 scanner, learn to read codes and research fixes on Youtube.    From what I've read,  I know that a transmission may be in my future.  But,  I'm not worried, as I know a great transmission guy.  At the price I've paid for this car,  I can afford a transmission.  Oh, the AWD is excellent in ice and snow.  I run Bizzaks  on spare wheels in the winter and it never gets stuck.  All round great vehicle and I would drive it anywhere.  Wish gas mileage was better, but then what SUV gets great mileage?  Again, considering the price I paid for the car and I can afford gas."
acura,mdx,2005,B. Thesing, 03/29/2019,THIS IS A GREAT CAR FOR THE MONEY,pos,"This car is a great car, especially considering it's a 14 year old car. Mine has 186,000 miles on it and still runs like a clock! This was a great buy although I did have to get the transmission replaced at 140,000 but that was the only problem I have had. Also make sure to get the timing belt replaced at the regular intervals, this is an interference engine and the valves will bend if the belt breaks. Great sound system, great room, great comfort, and usability. Buy this car if your in the market for an older luxury SUV with a lot of life left in it! (Quick note, this car does require premium fuel, so take that into account when considering operating costs.) I average about 15 city, 21-22 highway so keep that in mind that gas isn't cheap for this thing.
"
acura,mdx,2005,VW, 08/22/2008,A Little Overrated,pos,"I find the MDX to be more hefty and top heavy in driving dynamics than I expected.  It's pretty thirsty at 15 MPG city.  Engine seems rock solid and smooth. Ride suspension is tuned nicely -- not too firm, not too mushy.  Should have HID and lane change signal without having to clicking on the signal arm.  Stereo is pretty good quality. XM is nice.  Navi and Handsfree link are a little awkward to use.       "
acura,mdx,2005,MDX man, 09/21/2009,Extended warranty,neg,"I have this truck for over 4years, I took to dealer at least 5 times for various problem.... Nice design, need to improve quality... Starter, Valve, Transmission, shock-- etc some of the few problems that have with this truck...."
acura,mdx,2005,BB, 12/11/2017,Biggest mistake of the decade,neg,"If you are buying an Acura MDX of 2005, big mistake, we bought it, used it for a decade just fine, don't get me wrong, there was no issues with her from 2010 ( we bought her used) till 2014. We paid and kept updated for everything we possibility can. In last 2 years, we have spent for transmission, brakes, spark plug, coil, batteries, tires and brakes, some of these are repeated expenses. Total of approximately $11,000 in last 1 year and she stopped on me again this morning. I wish I had taken a new one instead of investing so much on her. What a rotten piece of machine. Yes I don't have a right to complain because she did fine for the first decade, but what is the point of keeping a constant flow of expenses if this is what we have to deal with.
"
acura,mdx,2005,GatorJeff, 03/27/2010,Been a Good SUV,pos,"Overall this has been a solid vehicle. The only problem has been the torque converter at 57,000 miles.  Acura paid a large portion of the repair cost though.  I really love the MDX and can't seem to find anything worth selling it for.  I usually keep cars for three years but after 5 I want to hang on to it for a while longer.  I really like the design and interior technology."
acura,mdx,2005,atlas, 02/27/2006,Don't let them fool you this is a truck!,pos,"I have had many Acura's even a new NSX, an RL etc. and this car is a disappointment overall and after one year I am looking to trade it for something different. Here are my complaints- 1) NOISY on the road-- wind noise from the rearview mirrors, tire noise that is mindnumbing after 30 miles 2) a sloshing noise from the fuel tank which is insulting for a car over $40,000 -- unforgiveable 3) Some sort of noise from the brakes after you back up-- dealer says they have to reset or some story 4) XM radio cannot be scrolled through the stations numerically with the station titles displaying quickly- it takes seconds for the station title to display. 5) Voice activated is a joke-- hardly works-"
acura,mdx,2005,JDog, 05/11/2005,Very satisfied with our choice,pos,"We looked at the usual suspects in this category.  Ultimately, we went with the MDX as the best overall combination of drive quality, convenience and comfort - it's a great car.  "
acura,mdx,2005,edavis, 05/23/2005,Rides like a go-cart,neg,"When I first purchased by Acura, I loved it. But after the first year and several miles later the suspension is terrible.  It bounces like a go-cart and the brakes are pretty scary too. I believe that it is the front wheel drive that causes the problem with this SUV. The dealer tells me that I have to come in and spend $600 to reset the suspension to the original factory specs, this must be a recurring problem with this vehicle. The air conditioner also makes a loud rattling sound. "
acura,mdx,2005,Joanne, 06/19/2008,Love This Car!,pos,"Bought this car in February of 2005.  Haven't had one problem with it since!  Very reliable and very luxurious.  Was coming from a 1998 Toyota Camry LE.   Compared it to the Lexus RX 330.  While the Lexus was nice, it couldn't fit 3 people across the third row comfortably.  But my Acura can. The Bose stereo in my MDX simply superb and this car handles so nicely.  The nav system is also extremely easy to use.  Like the V6 and the AWD.  I also like the visibility that comes with being higher off the ground.  Will never buy anything other than an Acura.  Unfortunately the gas mileage is around 12 MPG.  I do mostly city driving but  I was expecting more like 16 from a mid-size SUV with just a V6."
acura,mdx,2005,2005 MDX, 07/06/2008,2005 MDX Review,pos,"Bought the original style MDX because I just knew the new model wouldn't be as nice.  I have never been so happy with a car in my life.  It's a wonderful highway cruiser and up in the rockies, it just handles the whoop di doos very solidly, no floating around, just well composed ride.  Mileage is 21 highway average at 75 mph and around town 13 (100% stop & go).  I got the touring model with nav & the tow package.  The AWD works wonderfully.  I took it out in the desert near Moabe, Utah and it will go down creeks & up sand banks with ease.  In snow it's a joy, give a lot of confidence in any type of bad weather.  Reliability has been excellent with only the nav being replaced, have 75K miles"
acura,mdx,2005,Michael Miers, 08/01/2008,My favorite vehicle ever owned!!!,pos,"I love my MDX. Nothing wrong with it, and have had no problems. This is my favorite vehicle I have ever owned. Bluetooth works great!"
acura,mdx,2005,Big Fan, 12/07/2008,My Wife Loves this Car,pos,"This is a great car.  Comfortable seats, quiet, smooth.  My wife's friends always ask her to drive because they all love this car. Very reliable - transmission replaced under warranty, no other problems."
acura,mdx,2005,Brocktune, 01/02/2008,Great Car,pos,"Bought this car new in March 05 and have loved every minute of it.  My only regret was not talking the wife into getting the Navi.   Test drove all the competitors, but the MDX blew them all away.  I love the car-like handling.  The bluetooth can have trouble picking up my voice when the air or heater is on.  It has led to some frustrating exchange (me--""dial 911""  MDX--""now calling 753.""  Also, there is a sloshing sound from the gas tank. I took it back to the dealier shortly after purchase, but there was nothing they could do about it.  Eventually, I just got used to it, and I no longer notice it.  "
acura,mdx,2005,IZJ, 09/04/2009,Outstanding Family Vehicle,pos,"The MDX is overall a truly outstanding family vehicle.  Ours has 74,000 miles of intense use and wear.  The balance of comfort, utility, passenger space, cargo room, handling and performance is remarkable.  Honda is a packaging genius for figuring out how to create so much space in a reasonably compact vehicle.  Acceleration is good for a heavy vehicle.  Interior room is excellent and the leather seats are comfortable and durable.  Many long  road trips have been completed with enjoyment and ease. My wife and I have 3 children, aged 4-11. Gas mileage is solid, 16 city, 24-25 pure highway.  An early electrical problem was fixed and we have had no other issues. We will keep our MDX for years. "
acura,mdx,2005,desertmom, 01/05/2011,I love this car,pos,"I have had my MDX for over 5 years it now has
126,000 miles. I have not had any problems and it runs great. I definitely would buy another."
acura,mdx,2005,raoanil, 12/04/2004,raoanil review,pos,This is a great SUV for the money.  It provides a comfortable ride and is a very high quality product.  I would clearly recommend this to anyone in the market for a luxury SUV.   
acura,mdx,2005,keehn, 12/22/2004,Perfect,pos,"After a 2-month search and test drives of the FX-45, RS-330, Touareg, SRX, & XC-90, I short-listed the Lexus RS-330 and the MDX.  I found the MDX to be the all around winner.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Chaos, 01/06/2005,Great SUV,pos,"Just got this car and drove it up to Tahoe in time for 9 feet of snow.  Handling was flawless.  Didn't think I would like the XM radio and backup camera (both included) but have decided that they are good to have as well.  I test drove virtually all other SUVs in this price range +/- $20k.  Handling of the MDX was among the best,  acceleration was adequate even at 65mph, height above the road was good.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Jack Wall, 01/13/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Shop and compare you won't beat this SUV when it comes to style, quality, reliability, and value.  I've test driven nearly all the mid size luxury SUV's and you can't beat this car. The ride is solid on wet and dry pavement, on back roads or cruising at 80 mph down the freeway.  Going skiing driving on ice and snow there is no slips going up or down.  There is room for all the gear and four people in the car!  Who needs a rack.  Going golfing same thing.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Vigi, 01/14/2005,Great Car,pos,"'05 MDX replaced my '92 4Runner, I get perfect parking 100% of the time, using the rear camera, excellent design and integration of front stereo with rear entertainment system. Very comfortable, kids love it to. I'm waiting for the hybride version of this car, it gobles gas alot, but it worth the comfort."
acura,mdx,2005,Imran, 02/01/2005,MDX,pos,"The MDX is a phenomenal car.  If you compare the MDX versus the X5, which I was doing, there is NO comparison.  It gives you comfort, power and the all the gadgets guys love.  I got my MDX, basically fully loaded, for $42K, that is pretty good for the class that this vehicle is in.  "
acura,mdx,2005,APildes, 02/13/2005,2004 MDX,pos,"This vehicle is spacious, extremely comfortable, has a great stereo system, and there is very little road noise. Visability all around is excellent. Pick up is good, but could be better when accelerating from a stop. The engine is more than adequate for highway driving and does not strain when going 70 mph. I am extremely happy with my MDX and would consider purchasing an MDX or an Acura car when my lease is up."
acura,mdx,2005,Jody, 02/13/2005,The BEST,pos,I Love my MDX.  Have had absolutely no trouble with it.  I don't think the interior is bland at all.  It gets the best mileage for an SUV.  I think you get the most for your money with the MDX. Love the Navi too!
acura,mdx,2005,G. Davies, 02/12/2005,MDX,pos,"I test drove a number of vehicles and did a lot of homework prior to deciding on the MDX.  I do mostly in city driving and have been amazed at the smooth, quiet, drive and supurb handling.  On the highway, it handles equally as well.  It's comfortable and provides everything I need.  I only wish I got the Navi system!!!!  Although Edmunds states the MDX is bland and ho hum, I think it's a classy and understated look of quality."
acura,mdx,2005,Lincoln Wilmot, 02/13/2005,Great Automobile,pos,"In a nutshell, this is the best value for your money out of all the SUVs I test drove. This vehicle is beautiful to look at and drive. It is the best experience I have ever had in an automobile. For the money you pay for this vehicle, everything is standard. The braking and power is unbelievable and it also has a tight turn radius. I am extremely satisfied and would recommend this vehicle to anyone."
acura,mdx,2005,Texan, 02/13/2005,2005 MDX - tested better than the rest,pos,"Early days, but extremely satisfied: soft ride, good acceleration, great nav & stereo, seats all roomy and comfortable, and sits high with good view of surrounding traffic. Road tested (over 2 month period) against Lx-330, Fx-35, M-Class, VW-T and the Pilot (just see if there was a difference since everyone said it was just a Pilot - Acura is a much tighter drive, not to mention the luxury items - it is different)."
acura,mdx,2005,songbird, 02/17/2005,Satisfied,pos,"I am very, very pleased with my MDX.  It handles like a car and has great power.  I love the room that it has for my family and the interior is squite comfortable.  The third seat is a major plus that comes standard with this vehicle.  I have also been pleased with the gas mileage that I get with my MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,dl, 02/26/2005,Luxury SUV at a price,pos,"Having driven the MDX for several months, I've found it to be a wonderful experience.  I've already taken it up to Lake Tahoe several times with no problems.  It has plenty of power up the mountain with 4 power & equipment and ample braking power.  My friends are impressed with its roominess.  Being my first SUV, I looked at both the Lexus & MDX.  I chose the MDX for its 3rd row seating.  There's just so much more room on an MDX and not everything is an option. One thing to keep in mind, Acura recommends using premium gas for the MDX."
acura,mdx,2005,HappyRealtor, 03/25/2005,Outstanding SUV,pos,"Have owned this vehicle since Nov. 04 and never ONCE regretted my choice. Shopped for 6 months before deciding on the Acura MDX. As a Realtor, I drive many hours a day with clients and they absolutely rave about the ride.  Wouldn't be without the NAV system -- it's awesome and gets me out of traffic jams easily.  Comfortable, easy and fun to drive. Holds tons of cargo and the third row for seating is actually roomy enough for adults!  Only wish the gas mileage were a little better but that is typical of all SUVs. I will keep this vehicle for as long as I can."
acura,mdx,2005,Anthony, 03/29/2005,Dont get on the road with out it smile,pos,"Driving this car I found to be very reliable and surefooting.  This would be the car to drive before making any decisions on another model of SUVs.  It is not totally an off road vehicle, but capable of holding its own."
acura,mdx,2005,Great MDX, 03/29/2005,Best Mid Sized Luxury SUV Around,pos,"We have had our 05 Touring w/Nav MDX for four months now (all winter) and absolutely love it.  For all out traction in mud/snow, this one can't be beat.  Solid as a rock and have had not one single problem.  Voice activated Navigation is absolutely amazing.  Looked at the RX and X5, both were way overpriced and gas mileage was worse than MDX.  It's time for an MDX Hybrid."
acura,mdx,2005,rsl82472, 03/29/2005,love it!,pos,"I love this car and I think everyone who has one does! I love how custumizable they are, you rarely see two the same, unless they are base models with-out accessories. When people personalize their MDX generally you'll they often com up with their own combinations to creat a unique look. But surprisingly Acura doesn't offer any rim choices."
acura,mdx,2005,Bill, 04/09/2005,Great Vehicle,pos,I got a SUV for reasonas associated with a bad back.  It has proved to be much more.  The MDX is a very comfortable smooth ride with great handling.
acura,mdx,2005,ChaosMiners, 04/10/2005,Great SUV,pos,I drove this car for a week at Lake Tahoe while we were getting 9 feet of snow.  Not a hint of a handling problem even when the roads were heavily iced.  One great feature is that the driver's seat will lower to a point where you can get in and out of the car on ice without transferring all your weight when standing on ice.
acura,mdx,2005,jpinches, 04/11/2005,Luxury in a Smaller and Wide Footprint,pos,"Having driven a BMW 528 for the last three years, performance, handling and amenities were important in a SUV.  I have driven many rental SUVs and had a reference base to other SUVs to compare the MDX to. The MXD won hands down!  The 265 hp is just right for vehicles of this weight and braking is very responsive. The MXD resists body-roll in corners very well. The power lumbar support helps keep the driver in place in the seat.  The voice command Nav and Bluetooth phone link is great.  The Bose system is a 8 out ot of 10 in audio quality. Could offer more midrange control in audio setup. The MDX has already proven to me to be the best choice for my needs after only several hundred miles"
acura,mdx,2005,JimBo, 04/28/2005,Best bet for your money!,pos,"This is a great midsize luxury SUV.  Great options for your money. Costs less then the X5 and has many more options, not to mention good safety rating. Highly recommended!"
acura,mdx,2005,Paula, 05/13/2005,Love My MDX!,pos,"I appreciate the way my MDX handles.  It is as comfortable as a sedan, yet with all the added space and uses like a truck.  I am extremely pleased."
acura,mdx,2005,Stacey, 05/14/2005,Crash Tested,pos,I recently totalled my 2004 in an unavoidable accident.  The car safetly features are amazing.  Everything worked perfectly saving my and my 7 year old from serious injury!  I can say this car performed amazingly under the most important of all curcumstancies and I have orded a new 2005 to replace it!
acura,mdx,2005,WB, 05/14/2005,Great SUV,pos,"Great handling on the highway, and the rural areas where I drive.  Super Navigational system, it is easy to use.  There is a lot of leg and shoulder room in this SUV.  I have had Jeep Limited's before, and this SUV is built solid. "
acura,mdx,2005,irishwheat, 05/17/2005,Wished for More,neg,"Wished this car had been as reliable and fun to drive as other Honda products. In general, a great disappointment. Electrical problems and navigational breakdowns. AC would not shut off. In shop five times in first 7 months."
acura,mdx,2005,Massie, 06/11/2005,MDX is the best!,pos,"More than a year of research and finally decided to get the MDX. The 2005 model have almost everything I wanted in a vehicle, the voice controls, blue-tooth tech., navigation, DVD entertainment, power seats, memory, on-star, backing-up camera, rain- sensing wipers, 7-seats, AWD, blah blah blah... etc. It is worth every penny and the whole family loves this car so much."
acura,mdx,2005,Urugly, 06/12/2005,Post purchase review,pos,"I just got the touring MDX with Navi and love it to death.  I have always like this car since 01' when it came out. All the gadgets that it comes with in its class can't be beat.  Heated seats, power everything, 3rd row seating, AWD, Blue LED  interior lights, Onstar, XM, voice activated navi and control.. the list goes on...."
acura,mdx,2005,Wendy, 06/12/2005,You Gotta Get One,pos,"You must buy the Acura MDX. I really enjoy mine. I researched it for about two months before I purchased it. This was the best SUV purchased I've ever made. I have all the toys, which is standard. You will not go wrong with this purchase. I also have the Bose system and it sound GREAT! Especially with my iPod. Smooth and quiet ride."
acura,mdx,2005,Peter C, 06/15/2005,Best SUV Deal,pos,"I went from an Accord to the MDX wanting a vehicle for 4 wheel reliability & being quite pleased with Honda's workmanship. I also wanted a good deal which after studying all the other SUVs in the MDX price range, I feel I got it. It is a good looking vehicle, with good solid engine performance I am  real pleased with my MDX. "
acura,mdx,2005,DebO, 06/15/2005,Thumbs up for my MDX!,pos,"I was deciding between the MDX and the Lexus RX 330.  All the reviews, including Edmunds, seem to view the MDX as more utilitarian and less ""desirable"" than the RX.  Well, thankfully I didn't listen--I bought the MDX and I absolutely love it.  I'm so glad I decided to test drive the MDX.  Fuel economy is a little less than I expected in the summer, but a small price to pay for such an awesome SUV."
acura,mdx,2005,Shelley N, 06/26/2005,I Love My MDX,pos,I have been driving an SUV for 16 years and this is by far my favorite of the lot! I bought my 1st MDX 4 years ago when they first hit the market and I now have my 2nd. I love the look and the ride is comfortable and car like. It is totally reliable and the size is perfect for a sports Mom with 3 growing boys. I can't imagine a better SUV available in this price range! Drive one and you will be hooked   
acura,mdx,2005,Fred Miller, 06/28/2005,freddieboi,pos,"safe, solid fun to drive for an SUV, good looking, very dependable, comfortable and solid as a rock"
acura,mdx,2005,Austin Barney, 06/28/2005,Hard to beat...but for gas mileage !!,pos,"I have had my MDX for about a month... first car that ever talked back to me! I looked at MANY other cars first and think I chose the best for my needs, a combination of off road and long distance driving. The car is great in all respects but the gas mileage is atrocious!! I am getting 14.4 around town and only 18.6 on the highway ! Miserable compared to my last car, a W8 VW wagon."
acura,mdx,2005,Brenda, 06/30/2005,Happy New Owner,pos,Have researched SUVs for about 4 years and always came back to the Acura MDX as the top choice.  Purchased in 2005 and so far we have really enjoyed our MDX experience
acura,mdx,2005,Harrisburg, PA,None like it in the market...,pos,"There isn't another Lux SUV on the market that has the blend of size and utility with comfort and safety like the MDX.  Seating for 7 with safety features like Onstar and all the airbags you could ever want.  The review states that the interior is bland, but I would call it understated elegance.  Everything is where it should be and the materials (dash; seats; etc.) are all top quality.  The only things I wish it had are daytime running lights and automatic locking when placed in drive.  Overall the wife loves it (even the nav system I had to have) and the kids like being able to have their friends all in one car.  NOTE:  The MDX is due for a redesign in 2007."
acura,mdx,2005,bobfir, 07/07/2005,2nd time around,pos,When my lease came up on my 2001 MDX I looked at everything in the Luxury class and just couldn't find another car that I liked any better. As a Real Estate broker I needed a SUV that was confortable in the back as well as the front. The reclining back seats are much better than the straight up and down seating in many other models. The NAV system is the best in fuction of any I have seen. ONSTAR and XM are also a great addition to the older model. The best car I have ever had (my 2001 MDX) got better. 
acura,mdx,2005,sftonykim, 07/07/2005,COMPETITION???? NONE!!!!!!!,pos,"I just bought my 05' MDX w/NAV & DVD Ent. on 4th of July. I had and still do have Lexus 300 for the past 4 years and there's just no comparison. I wanted to buy a 7 passenger seating and was looking at Lexus  GX470 and MBZ ML500. Compared all the vehicles by its features, comfort, gadgets/technologies, options, hp, torque, styling, and value.... with two hands WAY DOWN, MDX came out ahead. There's just no way that MBZ ML500 nor Lexus GX470 could compete. Both MBZ & Lexus's rear/back passenger seats are installed on the side of the trunk space....so inconvenient!  If you want the BEST SUV, MDX is way to go. Don't even waste your time shopping around!  "
acura,mdx,2005,George Pado, 07/10/2005,a quality drive,pos,"This is absolutely the best vehicle I have ever driven.  The MDX touring package has all the bells and whistles anyone can want in an SUV. A little pricy compared to some other SUV's but well worth the money.   Acceleration is fast and smooth, with a very quiet ride. "
acura,mdx,2005,McGinnisRohe, 07/10/2005,Acura MDX,pos,Love everything about this car except the amount of wind noise on the highway.  The navigation system is by far the best in the industry.  I have friends with three other systems and they all envy this one for ease of use.
acura,mdx,2005,Kevin, 07/21/2005,MDX Overview,pos,"Good car overall, the biggest SUV size for the smallest SUV type."
acura,mdx,2005,M.Dennis McCarron, 07/26/2005,My second but hardly final MDX,pos,"The '05 MDX is a world above the '01 I had first and THAT was a great vehicle! This may not be the splashiest SUV on the lot, but it is much more quiet and nimble than any other I have owned. I think the gas mileage is fair at 20-21 mpg but sustainable for now. The turning radius still amazes me!"
acura,mdx,2005,Lynn, 07/26/2005,Great SUV!,pos,"Great SUV!  Nice size makes handling easy. Smooth driving.  Loaded with fun gadgets and entertainment. A lot of interior bang for the buck!  Kid friendly.  Easy to maneuver 3rd bench when needed.  Nice storage space. This is our fourth SUV in 10 years and is definitely my favorite.  The safety scores are good, too.  Good range of vision through windows."
acura,mdx,2005,Hangdog, 08/15/2005,A great minivan alternative,pos,"I love the seating for 7.  Driving the MDX feels like driving a car, no heavy truck feel.  I think I'll stay with this one for a while!"
acura,mdx,2005,Jackie Morehead, 08/16/2005,Nothing Else will Do,pos,"My new MDX is the best, it drives so well, turns so well, rides like a dream. I let a friend drive it and they were so impressed.  I love my On Star and Navigation they are so good and the blue tooth phone as well as the other phone.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful my new Acura MDX is. "
acura,mdx,2005,Jim Lipsky, 08/17/2005,"An ""Accurate"" Description",pos,"I'm very pleased with my Acura MDX.  I traded up from a V6 Accord Navi and haven't looked back or regretted a thing, short of filling the gas tank daily (I'm a Realtor, and put lots of miles on the car).  My invalid father gets in and out easily and clients like the roominess and Navi system.  Nice job Honda!  "
acura,mdx,2005,John, 08/18/2005,Trade up to 2005 MDX,pos,"4,000 miles of experience and still enjoy driving my MDX.  Features and comfort are better than expected, gas mileage a little worse (18 MPG).  The on board computer shows about 22 MPG best case on the freeway. The RES causes some rear visibility issues, but workable.  The ride is much better than my prior SUV (V8 Explorer) and power about the same.  As claimed, the MDX drives a lot smaller than it is, and feels very stable at all speeds.  The MDX is a perfectly balanced SUV that does just about everything well, albeit not best in class."
acura,mdx,2005,carol, 08/27/2005,for moms who refuse to do the minivan,pos,"This car is feels custom made for our family of 5 plus 2 large dogs.  The seating options work out perfectly for us.  I love having 2 ""extra"" kid seats in row 3 for the kids' friends or for when my own lovely children need to be separated.  And the front seat airbag sensor means I feel more confident when my older children sit up front. In truth, we should have a minivan -- that is the ultimate in convenience for a motley crew like us.  BUT my final rationalization for the MDX was that when it was time for my oldest to start driving that this would become her car.  I'm sure she'll be much happier inheriting the MDX than a minivan!!!"
acura,mdx,2005,flajcat, 08/31/2005,Good Investment,pos,"My wife has a 2002 MDX and because of the performance, quality, craftsmanship, I decided to buy a 2005 MDX.  Way above average resale value.  No problems in 3 years, excellent quality.  The back up camera adds to safety.  There are 8 airbags, high quality interior.  Very good engine performance.  Luxurious inside.  Navigation system is a 10.  Mediocre gas mileage.  I am getting about 18 combined highway and city.  "
acura,mdx,2005,mna, 09/13/2005,Fun to drive long distances,pos,I drove in the middle of winter thru snow and mud long distances. It was a very comfortable ride and drive. It is a smooth running suv and drives like a car. 
acura,mdx,2005,Gills Family, 09/27/2005,Excellent Family Vehicle,pos,This is my 4th owned Acura and this MDX doesn't disappoint.  It has a car-like ride which we like and the engineering and technology is well worth the price which we found reasonable for a Luxury vehicle.   Acura service is outstanding and we are looking forward to enjoying our retirement vehicle. The MDX is not just a vehicle but a solution to our transportation problems. 
acura,mdx,2005,HappyTourer, 09/27/2005,MDX is Great!,pos,"Looked at Lexus RX330 and Toyota 4- Runner but Acura won out with best design and ease of use.  Mileage has been as expected about 19 mixed use so far, but better than the old 4-Runner with 150HP.  Power is excellent.  We added rear body-colored wing which makes it look even better.  Hard to believe the MDX is still somewhat hard to come by after 5 years on the market.  I still own a '91 Legend Coupe and cannot bear the thought of parting with it.  Had no problem trading off the 4-Runner, though."
acura,mdx,2005,Jim, 09/28/2005,Acura MDX,pos,Everything is great but the GAS mileage. Only average 17mpg. Less than I expected.
acura,mdx,2005,Tay, 10/22/2005,Not disappointed,pos,"For 1 whole year, I researched and test drove SUVS from Lexus, Infiniti, Jeep, BMW, Volkswagon, and a few others as well as the MDX. I loved the MDX from the moment I drove it, and now that I own one, I love it even more.  The MDX is fun to drive, loaded with many luxuries and comforts, has great power (Awesome pickup), great sound system, and in my opinion the best Navigation system of any car I drove. Add to that, this is dollar for dollar one of the best deals out there, and it's also one of the most dependable Mid-SUVs out there, this is one really amazing vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,wm stiehm, 01/02/2006,Best SUV I've owned,pos,"The MDX is superior in all respects for an SUV.  Although the total weight didn't push the specs, I towed a 1100 lb boat and 400 lb trailer 1800 miles with ease and with a feeling of control at all times.  This included driving the mountains of NC and NY.  Its third seat is handy and I love its muscular look (compare to sister vehicle, the Honda Pilot)."
acura,mdx,2005,Suzanne, 01/08/2006,I Love My MDX,pos,"I have driven a minivan for years and this is my first SUV. We went with the MDX after test driving BMW,Lexus,Volvo. I was not impressed until I drove my Acura!  Main reason I chose it..Cargo room, and 3rd row seat is big enough for me or my 17 y/o son! Best of all were the safety rateings.  My MDX gets alomost 19mi/per gallon! Don't think that's bad for a 6cyl.  Heck I only got 14-16 with my minivan!  Wonderful ride in town or longer trips.  I would recommend this car to anyone looking for room, safety and looks!"
acura,mdx,2005,Paul Marsteller, 01/24/2006,Downsized for mileage but not so good...,pos,"Maybe I am not a mid-size SUV kind of person, having driven something much bigger for years. To save on guess I talked myself into this car, liking it better than the competition.  After 4 months I continue to be underwhelmed and am thinking of trading for a Seqioa.  I don't recommend this to anyone used to a bigger SUV who is just downsizing for the better mileage.  I'm getting about 17-19 mpg(70/30 hwy/city). Pluses:  Good navigation system.  Cons: Where to begin? Clunky and noisy over little bumps; lackluster hwy acceleration; inside windshield steams up ALL the time (never had this problem before; and I live in San Diego!); Sun seems to shine in too much; stiff to shift.. tra"
acura,mdx,2005,Bob, 02/04/2006,Safety,pos,We have owned this truck for about 6 months and have been about 95% happy with our purchase.  Owned several S U vehicles and this one outdrives them all by a long shot.  Often have 5 people in the vehicle and it's very comfortable.  
acura,mdx,2005,DK, 02/05/2006,This SUV rocks!!!,pos,"I decided go for this MDX because it has 7 seats, better values and excellent ride quality. It is wider than RX330 and comes with all the standrad features. However, I got around 15-19 mile per gallon with premium gas, it is not cheap!!! "
acura,mdx,2005,Nv, 02/06/2006,I love my MDX!,pos,"I enjoy the smooth ride and the technology advanced features.  I got all Navi and RES on my MDX because I didn't want buyers remorse.  And, I must say it's worth it.  I've had mine since Aug 05 and love it.  Navi has been reliable when I input addresses, but not as reliable with directory assistance."
acura,mdx,2005,Nice Ride, 02/26/2006,Love it,pos,"Went from a Toyota Camry XLS to the MDX since we have a toddler and another on the way.  Drives like a car, very smooth.  Comes standard with sunroof, heated seats, third row.  Has alot to offer."
acura,mdx,2005,ELC, 02/28/2006,Always Room for Improvement,pos,"Overall, this is a great vehicle.  The comfort and features are fantastic, but the handling could be better.  My engine sometimes ""jumps"" during quick acceleration and the vehicle does NOT inspire confidence during sudden/emergency braking.  I love the Navi system, but the voice control is horrible -- it never recognizes what we say, so we just use the touch screen.  On the positive side, the MDX is very roomy and comfortable, and the Bose sound system rocks.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Hecyes, 03/25/2006,MDX delivers,pos,"I've driven the MDX for over a year now and am very satisfied with its performance, driveability, and dependability. Its not as comfortable as the Lexus but you get a lot more for the price. The navigation system is amazing and the mileage you get is very good. I like the looks of it much better that the others in this price range...sleek and clean."
acura,mdx,2005,Tom, 06/05/2006,I actually don't mind making my payments,pos,"I'm not particularly a car person, but I have to say I really like this SUV. It's my first Acura and my 5th SUV.   It's very quiet, spacious, comfortable, and the navigation is fantastic once you learn commands. (At first I didn't think the voice rec. worked well but it was mostly my lack of understanding it. Fine now.) Body style is least favorate but added wheel flares, side molding, and running boards that help make it less bulbous."
acura,mdx,2005,Brandi, 07/25/2006,I Love It!!,pos,I love my MDX as much today as the day I bought it.  It drives like a dream and is very roomy.  Just last weekend we took 6 adults over 3 hours drive away with luggage and everyone had plenty of room.  Now if only they would come out with a hybrid with the new models...
acura,mdx,2005,rob2xmdxbuyer, 10/27/2004,Second time around,pos,"This is my second MDX and I love it 
more than the first one(2001) I had to 
wait 3 months for the first one and it 
was well worth it. The 2005 model is a 
great improvement. More power, 
comfort , options and its even quieter.

Hip, Hip huray for acura. and a 
special thanks to Rob at Paragon Acura 
for the great service."
acura,mdx,2005,outuvtime, 11/03/2004,Best choice in mid-size luxury SUVs,pos,"Great ride; rides like a comfy car and 
handles well also.

Gas mileage is lower than expected but 
that will hopefully get better as the 
engine break-in period elapses. "
acura,mdx,2005,lvernacc, 11/06/2004,I love my MDX,pos,"I purchased my MDX in May 2004.  This 
is the best vehicle I have ever driven. 
I researched other comparable vehicles 
as Lexus, Toyota, BMW and Volvo.  The 
MDX was not only the best value, but 
has the best ride."
acura,mdx,2005,luckyd, 11/09/2004,1st time MDX buyer,pos,"I compared the 05 MDX with the RX330.  
I ultimately purchased the MDX based 
on the value for the price.  I love 
the voice command system, still trying 
to learn the commands.  The ride is 
smooth for an SUV, nice acceleration, 
quite interior, & clean console 
setup.  I like the clean integration 
of the front radio with the dvd system.
The MDX was much larger than the RX330."
acura,mdx,2005,jhmdds, 11/08/2004,MDX,pos,"This is my second MDX and third Acura.  
When its time for service, my salesman 
picks up my MDX at work and leaves me 
his car for the day. I've never had a 
minute's problem.  These are great 
vehicles."
acura,mdx,2005,mark martin, 11/09/2004,2005 better than 2003,pos,"Had 2003 updated to 2005 the nav is 
great improvement and the voice 
activated features are a nice addition"
acura,mdx,2005,lbelle, 11/09/2004,'05 MDX,pos,"A very solid car. Acura has gone to 
great lengths to correct some of the 
problems of the more recent models such 
as the gas tank slosh and the brake 
clunking. The new acoustic lining has 
done wonders to mitigate noise. This is 
one silent and solid vehicle. Leather 
appears improved over prior models as 
well. "
acura,mdx,2005,Albert Chamakala, 11/08/2004,Most adventurous vehicle,pos,"This is the most funnest car to drive 
on and off road. It has good mileage 
but at the same time a real nice pick 
up time from 0-60. Its great for all my 
needs. The only thing that to my 
disliking is the shape of the front of 
the mdx. It has an angular front and 
I'd like it to be more flat."
acura,mdx,2005,sguinan887, 11/05/2004,acura mdx,pos,"this is an excellent riding and 
handling car. 
fun to drive and so far very reliable, 
the reason we bought it."
acura,mdx,2005,dmdm, 11/14/2004,We Love It,pos,"Decided to abandon the minivan this time around 
for something a bit sportier but with the same 
seating capacity as the van.  I cannot say enough 
good things about our MDX.  It handles much nicer 
than the other SUVs on our shopping list (feels like 
driving a sedan not a truck).  The interior is  very 
well done and we love the new exterior color Steel 
Blue Metalic.  Gas mileage could be better, but we 
expect it to get better as it breaks in.  Great choice!"
acura,mdx,2005,psr, 11/14/2004,2004 MDX Touring Review,pos,"This vehicle has the quality, size 
(interior,exterior)appropriate for most 
buyers. We have this SUV and a 2002 
Mercedes sedan. The MDX is the 
preferred transportation."
acura,mdx,2005,DRTur, 11/16/2004,MDX = Value SUV,pos,"Incredible value - feature, performance 
vs. price.  Acura reliability"
acura,mdx,2005,mell, 11/16/2004,great car!,pos,"very fun to drive, the dvd player is 
very nice. very roomy 2nd and 3rd row 
seating, fits 7 passengers comfortabley 
or TONS of cargo. navigation system is 
VERY helpful. very comfortable ride.. 
but it is a gas hog. goes good in snow 
and ice."
acura,mdx,2005,Edgardo, 11/16/2004,M D X,pos,"This is a great every day car, high, 
responsive and safe. 
3rd seat is great if you need it, but 
you are taking away confort in the 2nd 
seats. 
Navigation system is awesome, worth the 
extra money and so is the quality  of 
sound. "
acura,mdx,2005,Gotcha, 11/28/2004,Acura 2004 base model,pos,"Excellent.  Everything I wanted except 
good gas mileage!!!  Great value for 
all that is included and great 
performance."
acura,mdx,2005,andygs400, 11/27/2004,Wonderful car... but not perfect,pos,"I have only had this car for a couple 
weeks now, but I absolutely love it.  
It definitely has its shortcomings, 
but the car as a whole makes up for 
it.  Drove it from Phoenix to LA and 
back and I was never more 
comfortable.  Great blend of utility 
and luxury.  I would definitely get 
the Touring package because the little 
luxuries are great."
acura,mdx,2005,cdepaola, 12/08/2004,Looked at them all Acura best in class!!,pos,"We looked at and test drove all of the 
other midsized SUV's in the Acura MDX's 
class. We found the best deal and the 
best car to be the Acura. Fit was 
great, and we felt it looked to be the 
most upscale interior and exterior. "
acura,mdx,2005,Brandi, 12/15/2004,What a car!!,pos,"After test-driving 15+ different SUV's, 
the Acura won out. We seriously looked 
at the Lexus but with only 5 seats, it 
wasn't large enough for the option of 
my children's friends accompanying us 
anywhere. The navigation system is 
awesome, and a lot of fun to use. The 
reverse camera is very useful, although 
you can be fooled with the scale of it 
(everything looks far away). You can 
get spoiled with the automatic wipers, 
speeding up/slowing down as needed. 
Very useful for city driving. The Bose 
sound system is awesome. The 
entertainment system displays the XM 
songs and artists on the screen, which 
the children have been having a lot of 
fun with. I can't gush enough - I love 
this car!!!!!!!!!!!!"
acura,mdx,2005,Aaron, 12/19/2004,Great value,pos,"Hands down the best automobile I've 
owned. Did lots of research on SUV's 
before deciding on the MDX, and so far 
I haven't been sorry with my decision. 
great zip, room for 7, and the 
Navigation system that never ceases to 
amaze. Awesome sound system; rear DVD 
a must have for those with kids. 
Incredible number of features for the 
money. Very refined car, with the 
quality of Honda to back it up. Every 
control right where it's supposed to 
be - when you get into the drivers 
seat of this vehicle, you'll feel 
right at home!"
acura,mdx,2005,Jimbo, 12/20/2004,"Fun car, but...",pos,"Very smooth ride in comparison to my two
prior Ford Explorers.  Enjoy the nav
system however still learning commands
and touch screen can be hard to not make
mistakes.  A heating problem has
developed in our car, and the same issue
with a neighbor who has the same car. 
The local dealer is stumped.  Not a good
feature in the winter.  Other than this
the car is great."
acura,mdx,2005,George, 12/26/2004,MDX Review,pos,"Car is quieter and rides better than I 
thought it would.  New blue metallic 
color looks really great.  This is 
truly a very high quality car.  Also 
has storage compartment under floor in 
cargo area and many handy storage bins 
throughout passenger area."
acura,mdx,2005,kevinmak, 12/30/2004,Our top choice Luxury SUV,pos,"After owning 2 Nissan Pathfinders, a 
Ford Explorer, and a Mitsubishi 
Montero, it was time to step up to a 
Luxury SUV.  I had never considered the 
Acura a serious contender, leaning more 
towards the Volvo or Lexus... but after 
driving them all, there's no doubt that 
this is the best choice for the money.  
Hands down more bang for your buck than 
the Lexus (although it was a strong 
contender) and certainly capable of 
keeping us as happy as the Volvo while 
saving $7500 comparably equipped... 
this is a great vehicle.  I agree with 
the editor's review, a little ""bland"", 
but when you want a luxury SUX and 
you're in the $40k budget - I'd highly 
recommend the MDX!  What a dream to 
drive!"
acura,mdx,2005,Christine Spampinato, 01/02/2005,Comfort in driving,pos,"I love driving my MDX. It is a smooth 
and comfortable SUV. It has power to 
get you where you want to go. The 
visiblity is also great.I am able to 
see a lot more of the country side than 
with my sedan. I also like the seat 
warmer during this winter season. Over 
all it is a great SUV for the price. "
acura,mdx,2005,Deborah, 01/03/2005,Great choice,pos,"This is a great choice.  The engine is 
seemless, you do not feel it shifting 
like some other luxury SUV's I test 
drove.  Living near the mountains the 
power and engine is great, such a 
smooth ride.  The size is great since I 
did not want a huge SUV.  Love that it 
is ULEV2, which most SUV's are not."
acura,mdx,2005,Driving a Cayenne S, 01/06/2005,Very disappointed,neg,"Extremely disappointed in the product. 
Expected more pickup and much better 
gasoline economy due to 6 cylinders. "
acura,mdx,2005,GMSUSIE, 01/06/2005,Great Choice!,pos,"I have had this car for two months -- I 
have enjoyed every driving experience 
with it.  It is comfortable -- it feels 
like a true ""luxury"" car.  The 
navigation system and satellite radio 
are pluses.  The gas mileage isn't 
great, but I do drive it ""around town"" 
a lot of the time which doesn't help 
much.  We tried out ""all"" of the suvs 
and are so pleased that this is the one 
we chose."
acura,mdx,2005,guye, 01/06/2005,I love it,pos,"Just converted from a long run of Volvo 
sedans and I love it. Gas mileage isn't 
great but not much different than other 
SUV's. "
acura,mdx,2005,Dan Lanza, 01/16/2005,My first Acura experience,pos,"So far so good. This is a very nice 
upgrade from my previous vehicle
(RAV4L). The voice activated Navigation 
is worth every penny. I will report 
back in about 6 months."
acura,mdx,2005,George, 01/16/2005,Truly Satisfied,pos,"What a truck!  I only wish I could get 
car fuel economny!  A joy to drive with 
little maintenance cost.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Nicolo, 01/21/2005,Good SUV made better,pos,"Traded '03 for '05 touring with Nav.  
The new car is better in every way, 
quieter, quicker and with better body 
integrity.  List of additional 
features compared to the '03 is very 
long: side curtain air bags, power 
lumbar, built in XM, better nav, voice 
commands for nearly everything, better 
dashboard display, better audio, six 
disc dash CD, bluetooth, Onstar, 
bigger gas tank.  The Japanese, unlike 
American manufacturers, listen to 
consumers and make continuing 
updates.  "
acura,mdx,2005,cperry, 01/27/2005,Excellent vehicle,pos,"This vehicle drives great and comfort 
is unbelievable.  We have had over 2 
feet of snow and we haven't had any 
problems getting around"
acura,mdx,2005,seanandre, 01/26/2005,"Great car, keep those PINs!!",pos,"Bought it b/c baby on the way. Yeah, 
car was working perfectly. Interior 
light left on drained battery, got a 
jump... Need the pin numbers for both 
radio and nav to start working again. 
Had incorrect pin for nav, cost 90 
bucks to pull system out and ref serial 
number in database... If you buy car 
used (like us) get those correct pins 
AND serial numbers. Car is great other 
than that, we live in DC, the nav 
system is awesome and a must, much 
better than BMW, space is great (been 
remodeling condo and moving furniture). 
Gas milage from 15-24mpg depending on 
city/hwy. Not a hardcore 4x4, but just 
snowed and we never felt the vehicle 
lose ground on hills or get bogged 
down, just powered on through"
acura,mdx,2005,Bart, 01/28/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Very fun to drive in comparison to my
prior Land Cruiser. Handles the road,
curves and all, very nimbly. Touch
screen controls somewhat cumbersome to
use while driving."
acura,mdx,2005,moxnix1, 01/28/2005,Low quality control,pos,"Fun to drive, very responsive 
handling. Fuel economy is 
disappointing. Nav system and touch 
screen controls locked up when car was 
only a few weeks old. Temp control on 
heater has never worked properly and 
seatbelt sensor for passenger seat 
doesn't work. Other than that I love 
the car."
acura,mdx,2005,BarryD, 02/08/2005,Great SUV,pos,"This is a great SUV for the money.  It handles well and its comfortable.  With the spoiler on the rear door and some side steps, it also looks sportier than other SUVs. I was looking for a larger car, but found that the MDX is more comfortable than many expensive sedans, handles well and the electronics are great. "
acura,mdx,2005,Mary Ann Moss, 02/09/2005,Performance and comfort,pos,"I find the ride of the mdx to be smooth and comfortable.  Interior is roomy and stylish with extra's that I expect out of a luxury suv.  gas mileage is usually 20 to 21 miles per gallon for me.  That is good for this size vehicle. it's not hard to get in and out of (not to high, not to low).  If Acura wants any suggtions, the only thing is, I feel like for the price they should have added more wood grain to interior, such as the steering wheel and control panel.  This should have been standard the the touring package."
acura,mdx,2005,rugrats, 02/10/2005,Smooth rider,pos,"At first, I felt that it was big for me to drive, but then when I got used to it, I honestly prefer to drive my Acura MDX instead of Honda Accord/ Coupe.  What I like about this car it is very quiet and runs really smooth. I am very happy that we had selected this vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2005,Heli Bassham, 02/10/2005,Great car in more way than one.,pos,I have been driving several luxury cars in the past and I have never like any of them as much as I love my MDX. This car is just awsome. So much space and it drives so smooth handles great in the snow and rain. It is just a wonderful car. Thank you Acura for making it.
acura,mdx,2005,Chicago Rich, 02/21/2005,Excellent Vehicle,pos,"This vehicle is outstanding.  Everyday I drive it, I find new conveniences.  I've owned several SUVs including the BMW, Lexus LX470, and Dodge Durango.  This one takes the cake.  It is larger on the inside that it looks, and the car is smooth with no problems.  I am frugal in my praise, which has led two friends to also purchase the vehicle.  Great for families and excellent in the Chicago snow."
acura,mdx,2005,dsp888, 02/25/2005,Early Review,pos,"Only a month old but a great first impression. I was afraid going to a 6 from a Jeep V8 but this MDX has plenty to torque in all ranges yet cruises at 1500 to 2000 RPM.  Easy to drive with great handling and fantastic brakes. Sits a little highter than I am used to, and is larger overall - but the interior room is enormous and the rear camera on the Touring is to die for. While test driving I really spanked it in an empty parking lot and was impressed with the total stability. Lets see what the future brings."
acura,mdx,2005,Carole Matter, 03/08/2005,Awesome SUV,pos,"This is the best vehicle I've ever owned!  There is not a single thing I wish it had that it doesn't have.  It's the perfect vehicle--comfortable for lots of passengers when the extended family visits, or plenty of space to do major hauls of office supplies, etc.  It does everything you could want with perfection.  It handles like a dream--powerful, responsive, hugs the road, great visibility all the way around, and luxurious.  Comfortable for  long trips, and no more need to figure out your route to a place you've never been before--the navigation system will find your way and tell you every turn of he way.  It's absolutely awesome ine very way!  I LOVE my MDX!"
acura,mdx,2005,robert dinezza, 03/09/2005,Acura MDX,pos,"Vehicle rides outstanding in all conditions. easy manuevering in city. Good gas mileage. Great in rain, snow or ice."
acura,mdx,2005,bothell bill, 03/12/2005,Pain in the rear,pos,"Have owned my 2004 for 7 months and finally took it on a long cruise in Feb.  A 4 hour ride. After 2 1/2 hours my butt started going numb and then legs.  I think due to design of seat bottom.  It tapers radically towards where the seat back joins and the angled sides of the seat bottom press into the nevers of my butt. I'm 5'10"" and 185 lbs with 35"" waist.  I did the same cruise the first of March with the same result.  I took a friend with me the second trip and he experienced the same discomfort.  If you plan on long cruises, that a second look.  What about a four hour test drive??"
acura,mdx,2005,Chiefton, 03/15/2005,Great Ride,pos,I have had this car for a couple months now it is had been great so far.  I am very pleased.
acura,mdx,2005,Quest Fan, 03/15/2005,Fun to Drive,pos,"After going through some more expensive SUV's, I settled for the MDX.  Has more seating capacity than the RX330 or ML320 at a much lower price.  Love the way they package the vehicle so you dont have to mix and match like other vehicles."
acura,mdx,2005,PhoenixSun, 03/22/2005,Luxurious and Practical,pos,"Researched many comparable SUVs and selected the Acura MDX Touring Edition (Silver w/ Quartz interior). After 2 weeks, I've been very pleased with the performance, comfort and features. Great on the open highway, as well as on unpaved roads. Still brand new, but averaging about 18-19 miles to the gallon. The MDX does take premium gas, which is a bit more painful these days of high gas prices. Was able to purchase the vehicle for $500.00 over invoice and that was with body-side moldings also added."
acura,mdx,2005,RedSox18, 04/02/2005,2005 MDX Premium,pos,"I have had Hondas for 15 years and have owned two CRV's during that time.  This Acura was a bit of a splurge for me, but I felt it was a step above the Honda Pilot, offering a solid, quality vehicle with a little more luxury, comfort and style.  I spend a couple of hours per day in my car, so I am pleased with the purchase so far.  I have two kids, and the MDX comes standard with side curtain airbags, which the Pilot does not. So far, I am impressed with the MDX and the smooth ride and responsive handling. It handles well in rain and snow, and hugs dry pavement much better than my small SUVs. Highly recommend this quality vehicle.  Loads of room, too!"
acura,mdx,2005,jsa, 04/05/2005,Better than average crossover suv,pos,"We looked at the all-too-vanilla Honda Pilot for while, but we decided that it was so Honda that we couldn't bring ourselves to buy one. The MDX is a good compromise between blah and full-blown luxury. The ext. styling leaves something to be desired,but the versatility of the interior is what sold us over the Lexus RX330. We carry anything and everything in the MDX. Acura could do much better by adding the basic $38k items like daytime lights, seat memory and auto wipers. Ride is ultra smooth and quiet. Plenty of power and nicely appointed inside. A bit pricey for what it is though. Add auto-locking doors and power pass. seat to up the sense of value!"
acura,mdx,2005,Dan-Florida, 04/07/2005,You'll Love it,pos,"I did an extensive research for almost two months in the mid-size suv market and never found anything that compared to the MDX.  If you're looking in the 35k to 40k price range, make sure you check out the MDX.  I had an Expedition for 5 years and this feels just as big inside, which I did not expect.  I love the ride and the feel on the road and you will too."
acura,mdx,2005,Ed Bongart, 04/21/2005,Fun in my SUV,pos,Love driving the SUV and the satellite radio is great!
acura,mdx,2005,united_airline, 04/23/2005,7 passengers and no sweat !!!,pos,"I was very impressed with my 04 Acura MDX touring, navi. I had 7 adults and this baby climbs hill like I was sitting alone by myself. I don't have to add additional gas. I did not hear the engine make any noises when going up hill. It is truly remarkable."
acura,mdx,2005,ctmcsss, 04/27/2005,We love this SUV,pos,"We love the interior space.  We took 6 people and 6 pieces of luggage and 6 carry-ons to the airport with no problem.  This SUV is fun to drive.  It will give you a confident feeling in the rain, snow, and ice.  After comparing price, interior layout, and comfort to drive we couldn't find a better SUV.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Max, 05/08/2005,Balanced Luxury Utility Vehicle,pos,"My wife and I looked at several luxury and non-luxury 7-passenger SUVs.  The list included the Toyota Highlander, Cadillac SRX, Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, Mercedes ML, and more.  The SRX was the most fun to drive, but the XC90 had more safety features.  The ML had the best ""luxury"" interior, but the Highlander and Pilot were all priced considerably less.  Well, the MDX has more HP than the SRX, is second in crash tests to only the XC90, has better reliability than the Benz, and is more prestigious than a Toyota and Honda combined. Winning combination in our book!"
acura,mdx,2005,Michael, 06/03/2005,Overall a great vehicle,pos,"Looked at Pilot, Lexus 330, Volvo X90, BMW X5 and decided on MDX due to Acura reliability, safety, price and engine.  Pilot too bland, Lexus not enough storage, Volvo did not like turbo charged engine and price and BMW not enough storage, price and reliabuility. Have 7,500 miles and so far AOK."
acura,mdx,2005,lztucker, 06/19/2005,mdx is my 4th acura--great car,pos,grandkids love the entertainment center. we love the navigation system.  only complaint is back tail door-- not real easy to shut with one hand.. wish there was an automatic closer
acura,mdx,2005,Gene, 06/20/2005,"A Fine SUV, this MDX!",pos,"We have a 3 1/2 year, 84000 mile lease on a 2005 MDX, and more than half way through the first year, I am not disappointed.  I love how accura's navigation gets me there, even though I do not understand why the ""now time traffic conditions"" unit found in the  RL Sedan is not even an option. But let's not be picky.  This SUV is a dream to drive ON the road--I would not go to the beach or offroad with it. If you do not need the biggest SUV on the planet, this will satisfy.  "
acura,mdx,2005,Bill1701d, 06/22/2005,MDX - fun and efficient,pos,"This is my first SUV and it is a fun car to drive.  It also has great safety features and ample room although the third row has very tight leg room.  It's cargo space is excellent with the third row seating down and adequate when up.  The drive is firm but smooth and holds the road well.  I just bought the car so these are initial reactions, but I have a feeling this will be a vehicle that will hold up through the years nicely."
acura,mdx,2005,Carr, 06/22/2005,The best of the best,pos,This is one of if not the best car we have ever owned and that includes Mercedes.  The navigator is a real joy on trips or just around the area. The quality is top notch and it is so very nice to drive. Gas mileage on trips has been 24 mpg and around town around 20. The acceleration is a little slower than some cars such as entering the freeway but in all other respects this is just the best of the best!
acura,mdx,2005,dan, 06/22/2005,First Acura purchase,pos,"Traded a 2003 LS 430 for this vehicle in order to secure the third row of seating.  Ride not up to Lexus standards; however, all other features measure up and the value in relation to the SUV's from Lexus provided the decision to go with this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,apj9319, 07/13/2005,New Acura MDX purchase,pos,"Bought it for my wife after testdriving and researching ML350 (2006), X5 3.0, RX330 and LR3 V8. Best value for money in the segment. Although the interior quality, fit/finish and ""status factor"" is obviously inferior to others in the class and so also is the ride quality, it's a compromise worth making in the light of better acceleration (especially in the passing range) than the others, initial cost for comparably equipped models, projected 5 year cost of ownership, reliability and versatility. "
acura,mdx,2005,jim, 07/17/2005,great car on the road,pos,one of the reasons I chose the MDX was its ability to be towed all wheels down behind a motorhome. I have found the MDX to be a wonderful vehicle for this purpose atop all of the wonderful features it posseses as a staandard road MPV.
acura,mdx,2005,BHM, 07/17/2005,B's MDX,pos,I owned an '02 MDX and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I moved up the the '05 and it is more advanced thatn the '02 with the talk to it feature. 
acura,mdx,2005,RLPoloGuy4U, 07/18/2005,"Fun SUV, Nice Looking, Missing a little",pos,This is a great little SUV. It has several nice features however it is missing a few basic features. Only the drivers window is auto up/down and the sunroof is NOT auto either.  Gas mileage is not as good as I would have expected. Overall I am extremely happy with this SUV.  Acura offers the best SUV with the most options in it's class.  Much better than the X5 and not as regular as the Lexus.  A great buy if you are in the market!
acura,mdx,2005,Mike cinti, 07/20/2005,Solid SUV,pos,"great experience buying, solid ride.  Very fast and comfortable."
acura,mdx,2005,John, 07/30/2005,There's none greater..,pos,"This is my first suv, and third honda made auto (still have Honda my Accord ex 03).  And I couldn't think of owning two cars without  at leaset one of them being a Honda made vehicle.  My MDX is fully loaded and rides like a dream I tell you.  I from Queens NY, so who cares about going off road...?  And In the city we don't use our suvs for tow.  So with that said, my MDX has never let me down, in any shape form or fashion. It is more comfortable than many more expensive sport utes in its class.  And need I mention all of the standard equipment that comes with it...?  I know that when I'm ready to trade-in this badboy, I'm getting another-maybe the new RDX.. Hmmm..  We'll see. "
acura,mdx,2005,Alex, 08/02/2005,Smooth and Quiet,pos,"I bought my wife a 2005 MDX/ Fully loaded for xmas 2004.  We love it.  It's a little pricey fully loaded for the average family, but we believe it's well worth the extra money.  Its very quiet and has more power than anything we've driven.  In fact, we have driven interstate 80 through snow, steep grades, thunderstorms, hot summer traffic, ect..  and have been VERY pleased.  We test drove the Lexus GX470 and although you can't compair to the comfort and finish of a Lexus, the MDX drives with more confidence: better exceleration, better brakes, better seating layout, and just a better feel in day to day driving conditions.    "
acura,mdx,2005,Goulet, 08/04/2005,Acura Tops (AGAIN!),pos,"I traded out of a '97 CL to the '04 MDX and couldn't be happier.  Although it was a sad day, it was a happy day also.  Recently drove to NC from MA for the US Open and it was a most pleasant drive.  Navigation system helped us avoid all the DC traffic on our non-stop trip home.  The auxillary hook ups in the rear allow for a iPod to be installed and played continuously for hours (miles).  Love my MDX, just wish that there was a way to get a upgrade to get the bluetooth tecnology installed in the '04.  Currently don't know of this being available, but other than that, it's a GREAT CAR.  I'm an Acura man for LIFE!"
acura,mdx,2005,Wade, 08/03/2005,ACURA MDX TOURING w/NAVI,pos,"This is a nice looking vehicle, the navigation system is by far the best in the industry.  It is a better value for the money than other luxury SUV's.  The interior styling is kinda cheap looking with the fake wood grain.  If you need headroom this is not the vehicle for you.  Can not believe I had to order and pay for body side mouldings extra.  If you tow anything over 4,500 pounds you will not be able to do it with the MDX.  Would love to see Acura offer chrome wheels, would look so much better than the standard alloy, looks weird since the door handles are chrome."
acura,mdx,2005,June, 08/09/2005,Wonderful SUV.,pos,"This is the best car we have ever owned (touring & Navi.)! MDX improved a lot from 2001 to 2005 model and I am glad that we waited this long.  Although redesign is expected in late 2006, current model has been polished so much. MDX is the best combination of utility, reliability, and comfort compare to other upscale SUVs, I believe.  We will be keeping our MDX for a long time.    "
acura,mdx,2005,KeithK, 08/18/2005,Very Satisfied,pos,"My MDX has been fantastic so far - a great family car.  I've averaged 20 mpg (on mostly highway driving), which is a bit higher than I expected.  Acceleration is quite good, and the car is really comfortable.  Good cupholders, radio reception (things that are more important than you think)."
acura,mdx,2005,baradlee, 08/21/2005,I like it.,pos,"Nothing really to complain about except..GAS MILEAGE. In Southern California, in stop and go driving, 13.8 mpg. On the highway to Wyoming I did get 24 mpg. The V-6 has to move a lot of mass and I guess the gas mileage suffers."
acura,mdx,2005,barry, 09/02/2005,"Happy with MDX , But Not Mileage",pos,"Overall I am quite happy with my MDX.  More fun to drive than my other car, Audi A8.  Incredibly roomy inside, especially the cargo area for an SUV that is not that big on the outide.  Stereo sounds great.  Have not had any big problem with the brakes, except a little slow/sloppy when fully loaded with 5 people and a load of cargo.  Big disappointment is gas mileage.  One of the reasons I bought the MDX is because I wanted better gas mileage than my previous guzzling LX470 - but mileage is way below advertised, and not much better than the much bigger and heavier V8 powered LX470.  Nav system also disappointing. Interior quality also a bit chintzy for an expensive car."
acura,mdx,2005,left1, 09/03/2005,Great Decision,pos,Before deciding on the MDX we checked out a lot of SUVs.  What sold us was the Honda/Acura quality and dependablity as well as the feel of this SUV. We have had 9 Honda/Acura products and this one is great! Handles better than a lot of cars and rides better than most as well.  We took it on a 12 hour trip and were very pleased. We have not had any problems with the MDX. The longer we have this SUV the more we like it!
acura,mdx,2005,Hunter, 09/08/2005,You can't go wrong.,pos,"It's all included. When comparing to the others, consider total cost. Moonroof, heated, 8 way pwr seats, inter. wipers,  XM radio, OnStar, leather, memory seats/mirrors...it's all included in the Touring pkg. Nav is great AND Nav gives you back-up camera. Engine is quiet, smooth, tranny is seamless, and the confidence in high- speed interstate ramp turns and winding roads is fantastic - just a terrific stance. Good sight lines. It's not a drop-dead 'head- turner', but that's the Acura conservative style. The up-side is that everything is solid and proven before it goes into the car. The ""A"" badge does draw some 'ohhhhhhhhhs'. (Try the gold badges). "
acura,mdx,2005,John, 10/03/2005,The best for the money,pos,Great car especially for the price.  Extremely smooth transmission and very powerful 6 cylinder engine.  Very quiet cabin.  Handles like a car!
acura,mdx,2005,dhk, 10/04/2005,All-around best performer,pos,"After doing a thorough research, we settled on MDX and have not been disappointed.  This car does not do any one thing better than the competitors; Lexus has a slightly comfier interior; VW may have better off-road capability.  But the entire package is better than the competition.  Room for seven; Acura workmanship; lots and lots of power; and fair pricing.  We love than Acura won't nickel and dime you for features such as leather seating and moonroof. Everything comes standard.  The only negative - and it comes with the territory - is the gas mileage, though it is better than most SUVs.  "
acura,mdx,2005,gino mallamaci, 10/05/2005,perfect family suv,pos,a real pleasure to drive
acura,mdx,2005,Natalia, 10/15/2005,Best car I ever drove,pos," I love it! It could use better gas mileage. Very good on handling wet roads, turns.  Very smooth and quiet ride.  I did not think I would use Navigation system, but I was wrong.  It is very helpful, plus I am still learning about the vehicle."
acura,mdx,2005,Pawel, 11/13/2005,Luxury SUV for a great value,pos,"Great overall SUV The breaking is very responsive and very solid, acceleration very quiet and smooth. Handling is great! "
acura,mdx,2005,Nancy, 11/16/2005,Great SUV,pos,"I test drove the Volvo and Toyota Sequoia, and my husband has the Lexus 330.  The MDX is superior to all of three.  Great handling, relatively high off the ground, comfortable interior, easy to use navigation and dvd systems.  "
acura,mdx,2005,meileen, 12/19/2005,Love my MDX,pos,"I enjoy the handling, the style and the comfort.  It has been my favorite car purchase.  Used to drive a Ford Expedition and this by far handles better.  The service I get w/ Acura has been outstanding.  Only one change, wish it had a little more storage hiding space near the driver . "
acura,mdx,2005,berto, 01/12/2006,Not your typical Honda product at all,pos,"Exterior is much sportier than the older body style with the new head/tail lights and dual outlet exhaust but still looks somewhat minivan-ish.  Interior build quality is outstanding, not extravagant and everything is logically placed.  Very minimal body roll and understeer for what it is.  Stereo sounds great especially for a base model.  Sound deadening is better than any Honda/Acura I've ever owned.  Seats are comfortable--I had to drive 12 hours stopping only for gas and felt fine.  Motor is exceptionally torquey for a Honda, but you pay for it at the pump.  Acts like an Audi sometimes though--pulsing from rear when turning from a stop, and transmission shifting is somewhat sluggish."
acura,mdx,2005,professor, 01/28/2006,"Expected a great car, but....",pos,"I purchased this vehicle one year ago and have had some problems with the exhaust system and acceleration.  My MDX makes an annoying noise at the 2 rpm mark, and does not have very good acceleration at times; I have had it checked (with little success) at my Acura dealer.  There are also some interior noises in the back doors, which is bothersome to listen to at times.  I really expected a lot more from this vehicle, especially for the price that I paid.  The gas mileage is not that great as well....getting around 14-15 mpg in the city and 17-18 mpg on the highway, and I drive fairly conservative."
acura,mdx,2005,Hecklabs, 03/22/2006,Love my MDX!,pos,"I am so pleased with this vehicle.  I looked at BMW and Lexus and found that the storage capacity (we have 3 Labs) was much bigger in the MDX.  It is extremely comfortable, roomy and well built.  Add to that the fact that it is the most reasonably priced and you've got a winner!!"
acura,mdx,2005,Bill, 03/22/2006,Great SUV,pos,I have had Acura sedns for years.  I got the MDX for the higher seat due to a bad back.  I find that the SUV gives me many more options for transporting things as well as providing a very confortable reliable ride.  My only wish would be for better gas milage.
acura,mdx,2005,SueOOO, 03/22/2006,Love It!,pos,I love my MDX and I'm looking forward to upgrade to the 2007!!  This SUV has everything!  And living in New England in the winter...the MDX was made for snow!  It also looks great in the summer and having a versatile car as a young woman is key!
acura,mdx,2005,sklug, 06/10/2006,Great Vehicle,pos,Great car after 18 months no complaints at all and no issues at all. Fuel Economy is much better than expected. 23.4 mpg on our last trip to OHIO running 75 mph. Gets 18.6 around town.  Goes great in the snow on trips to the northwoods.  entertainment system and is great. Nav is a little out of date.  My wife will never drive a different suv.
acura,mdx,2005,mdx, 07/21/2006,Power and comfort,pos,Best vehicle I have ever owned.  Would definately get another in the future.
acura,mdx,2005,krc, 08/02/2006,Great SUV - Excellent value,pos,"After 18 months, I can't find anything not to like about my MDX.  This is my first Acura and second SUV.  I am a finicky consumer and researched all luxury models prior to buying - it paid off!  For the money, this is by far the best SUV in its class.  Gas mileage was better than anticipated.  And, it has the highest safety/crash test ratings.  Quality, comfort, and value...I love it!"
acura,mdx,2005,Carole Matter, 12/20/2006,Most Outstanding Vehicle!!,pos,"I have owned a lot of nice vehicles, but the Acura MDX is my favorite vehicle I've ever had!  It does everything well.  I have the navigation system on mine, which I personally would never want to be without again.  Acura has the best one out there, in my opinion.  I test drove a lot of cars and SUVs before I bought this one, and nothing compared. I have had 7 people in my car for a sightseeing trip, and it was wonderful.  I also have had the challenge and fun of driving my MDX through blizzard conditions and on snow-packed, icy steep hills in Pittsburgh, PA, and I went down a very very steep hill in AWD and never even slid.  The vehicle in front of me had gone down the hill sideways!"
