acura,mdx,2006,blondie, 02/25/2010,Transmission issue,pos,"I bought my vehicle in the end of 2007. I have loved my vehicle to date. Recently I started experiencing a shaking, shuddering when I let off the gas and then go to accelerate again. It appears to happen at about 40 mph. I have found out that it means I am going to have to have the torque and transmission replaced. Apparently this is common on the 2006 and earlier MDX. I am not at all happy and am now looking for a new vehicle, since this is a $7000 repair and I have no warranty. Apparently there is a recall on vehicles 2005 and earlier for the converter torque. Very disappointed since I bought this vehicle to keep long term."
acura,mdx,2006,blondie21dj, 03/22/2010,Noise between 35 and 40 mph,pos,"I am having a shuddering noise between 35 and 40 mph. It is usually when I lift my foot off the gas pedal and then go to accelerate. I took it to the dealership and they couldn't figure out what was wrong and I couldn't get the noise to duplicate. After reading several reviews on here, I figured out that it was the torque converter. I called Acura Client Services and reported the issue. They said they have not had a single person report this issue. Everyone needs to call and report this issue, so they can place a recall on this issue. They have recalls on 2005 and earlier but not 2006 as of yet. It appears to occur between 70k and 90k miles."
acura,mdx,2006,IgnatiusReilly, 05/17/2010,Very nice but not without headaches,neu,"I bought my CPO MDX about a year ago.  I drive mostly city/highway mix with a few long road trips here and there.  The gas mileage in city driving is weak averaging around 14mpg, nowhere near the 17 mpg it claims.  Pure highway driving has produced better results though getting 23.5 and 25 on two long highway trips.  The interior is what sold me on the car.  I'm 6'4 and this is one of the few cars that afforded me adequate seating room while still enabling an adult to sit behind me.  It comfortably fits 5 full size adults.  The all weather performance has exceeded my expectations.  I was able to drive through 1.5 feet of snow without issue."
acura,mdx,2006,mr.watson, 07/20/2016,Great SUV.,pos,"if you are thinking about purchasing the SUV just do it.  I just bought mine and its 10 years old. This vehicle runs like a 2016. Smooth ride, quiet cabin and plenty of leg room.
"
acura,mdx,2006,Acurafan, 10/16/2006,another great Acura vehicle,pos,"I really enjoy this Acura, the seating for 7 is great - can take my kids and their friends out in one vehicle. And can still park in my garage.  I've owned 4 previous Acuras, so I'm loyal,  but before buying this MDX I considered the  competitors. The MDX was the better total package - great balance of sporty features with practicality, Also, it's the perfect size allowing for a useful 3rd row (kids)."
acura,mdx,2006,Julia Romm, 01/24/2018,Great suv,pos,Bought the car at start of 2007. Still is a great car over the past 11 years. Recommend this SUV for a luxury 7 passenger.
acura,mdx,2006,Leet, 08/30/2009,Don't believe the MPG estimates!,neu,"If it were not for the mileage, this would be my favorite SUV (owned Suburban, Tahoe and Jimmy).  The vehicle can't meet the minimum mpg rating.  We drive this vehicle 50/50 hwy/city and are not getting crazy with the accelerator.  It's sad that I sold my perfectly running 03 Suburban for something I was told would get 17- 23 mpg and it only gets 1 mpg better than my 03 Suburban.  VERY disappointing...don't believe the salesman!"
acura,mdx,2006,Florida driver, 02/09/2010,Love it,pos,"Love it.  Bought used in 09 with 40k miles...lease turn in.  Was supposed to be certified but found the Onstar button didn't work.   Brought to dealership and they fixed...no problem.  Great ride, gets 19mpg on hwy and DVD system with bose speakers is great.  Nav can get washed out with sunlight or open sunroof though.  Expensive to upgrade to newer version.  No other problems to speak of. Loaded the back with work gear and seemed to set the back down a bit.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Acura MDX, 04/23/2008,Poor Fuel economy,neu,"This car is barely breaking 13 MPG that's combined city/hwy. Called Customer Service to see if they can do anything about it because  the dealer couldn't. The worst customer service ever, they said ""There is no issue for us to address"". WOW! That's after they put me on hold for 40 minutes."
acura,mdx,2006,MLW, 07/10/2019,Dream Vehicle,pos,"We bought my 2006 MDX Touring new, anticipating to keep it for along time.  I still own it, and it has 125,000 miles.  It has never broken down on me.  The standard maintenance is all its needed all these years.  I am investing in a new timing belt and muffler system since I expect to keep it for a few more years.  No complaints!
"
acura,mdx,2006,Bill's ToyTruck, 05/01/2010,Great work horse,pos,"Bought certified last year-had only 26k on it, due to some ""shop time"" having door and fender repainted and repaired. Use it as a music gear and trailer hauler, as well as my sole transportation. Great fuel economy (I average 19-20 mpg), even when hauling our 3,000 lb. Hi-Lo trailer. Also very solid build-no rattles. I put the transmission and power steering coolers on when I did the hitch, as Acura advises this. Also added a brake controller for the trailer. Put 9,000 miles on it and it's been great. Looked at new recently, but nothing hit me except the 2010 MDX at 45k. Can't justify banging up a new car that costs that much. "
acura,mdx,2006,maryindublin, 09/01/2007,Love my MDX!,pos,"I live in the mountains, lots of driving uphill and lots of snow in winter. Never had any problems in the snow with the AWD. I feel safe and confident. The front seats are very comfy, but the back seats could use a bit more room. I have a 3 year old in a booster seat in the back and he doesn't have all that much leg room. Still, I wouldn't trade it for anything and plan to drive it till it won't drive any more!"
acura,mdx,2006,Sailorgirl, 01/13/2019,Great family SUV,pos,"Great for a mom to carry children in town or on the toad.  Comfort, features were all great for my 12 years of ownership.
"
acura,mdx,2006,Rr, 08/05/2010,"Too noisy, never an Acura again",neu,"Typical Honda noise.  Cannot have conversation at highway speeds.  Engine whistling noise during highway speeds while accelerating.  Brake drum rolling noise while backing up and during braking at low speeds.  Terrible Bluetooth integration.  Only good for incoming calls.  Backup camera never good when needed most, too dim and is not useful when backing out from garage."
acura,mdx,2006,Kelayilg, 08/22/2006,Best value for the money paid,pos,"I replaced 2000 3.5RL with a 2006 MDX.  I purchased it from John Eagle Acura Houston TX.  For a Black on Black Touring model I paid $33,400 (including destination) +title and $50Doc. fee.  I am pretty happy with the price and the performance of this beautiful SUV.  Kids love the roomy interior with 7 seats.  I think this SUV is one of the best value for your money.  Smooth car like ride and the sleet look make it one of the best SUVs out there.  So far I am very happy with its performance."
acura,mdx,2006,AC and AS-C, 11/11/2006,recommend it!,pos,"Excellent, we are very happy with our MDX.  We are impressed with the quality of the car.  Well built."
acura,mdx,2006,toomanypetz, 03/27/2009,so nice,pos,"We replaced our Honda Pilot with this car.  I really liked my Pilot but to get all these features it would cost so much more.  The Acura has a smooth quiet ride and plenty of room.  I feel very luxurious with all the leather and comfort.  It makes me feel less like a ""soccer mom"".  We love it!"
acura,mdx,2006,Chief D, 12/08/2005,Sierra Hotel - Great Vehicle,pos,"This is my first SUV.  Having looked for almost a year, I kept coming back to the MDX.  It's a great driving experience.  The MDX is as smooth a ride as is our Avalon XLS (which my wife inherits).  Lots of room with lots of luxury."
acura,mdx,2006,SLS, 02/22/2006,3rd Acura - 2nd MDX,pos,This is my third Acura.  Have always found these cars a great value for the money.  Had my first 2002 MDX for 4 years and was looking for a new SUV but no matter how much research and test drives I did I kept coming back to the MDX because the price to feature and luxury ration could not be beat.
acura,mdx,2006,espoe, 03/03/2006,"Great Vehicle, needs updating",pos,"This is my first SUV and I went into one kicking and screaming.  But the need for a 3rd row of seats put me out of my long cherished German cars.  I compared this Nissan's entire line, Ford Freestyle, Pacifica, Higlander Hybrid, you name it.   I had narrowed it down to the MDX and the Highlander Hybrid.  Highlander was nice but felt less substantial and a lot more plasticky.   When I drove the MDX it was clearly different than the rest.  The quality just made itself evident in the way the dealer handled the transaction, the silky smooth drive train, quiet, comfortable, full time 4wd, warranty and the rest of the ride made it a simple choice.  Fuel economy is Ok.  Needs Premium, ouch!!"
acura,mdx,2006,pearl, 06/23/2008,Still Love My Acura!!,pos,"I still love my Acura after 2 years of ownership!  This is my 2nd car made by Honda and my other was an Accord and I have been very happy with both.  The Acura is like a Honda on steroids!  Love the back up TV, navigation, onstar, Bluetooth, heated seats, and my kids love the DVD.  I would definitely consider another Acura in the future!"
acura,mdx,2006,The Foxer, 07/14/2006,Buy another brand,neg,"We have owned a 2001, and 2003 MDX.  Both have the same problem.   The steering wheel vibrates at any speed above 65.  Tires replaced, wheel bearings replaced, rotors replaced and turned several times, tires ground force balanced and nothing fixes the problem. AC quit and multiple other problems. "
acura,mdx,2006,Jerry C, 05/21/2018,A very reliable and end enjoyable car to drive,neg,"I have owned this car for 12 years and have not had one day where I did not enjoy driving it. I have driven this car for 130,000 miles and the engine still hums. We have made several trips to Florida from the northeast and each time I have felt like I was sitting in an easy chair cruising down the highway. Maintenance has not been an issue. Changing  the fluids on a regular basis has kept the car in great operating condition If someone is looking for a great preowned  SUV I would recommend this vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2006,John Read, 05/28/2017,Great little suv,pos,"More road noise than you would expect.  Still a great little suv.  Still more road noise than I like.
"
acura,mdx,2006,mumbless89, 12/01/2010,never again!!!,neg,"comfortable car and roomy but the problems that  you get with this $40k car are unreal. Torque converters, transmissions, water leaks, cheap broken plastics, leather seats ripped after 4 years......gaskets around the doors are torn already!! unreal. Never again will i buy another acura product."
acura,mdx,2006,Diznefreek2, 10/15/2005,Love this car!!,pos,I use my MDX to bring my family (3 kids included) to the snow in the winter months and I have a hard time limiting it to that!!
acura,mdx,2006,Alan A, 05/28/2010,"Nice, reliable, but boring ride",neu,"Bought car new. Got good deal because new model year was arriving and dealer wanted to unload. Car has been very reliable.  Mileage running around 19 on average - and I do a lot of highway. Acceleration not bad at low end. Handling too mushy... feel like is going to roll over when aggressive on a corner. Interior space is adequate, rear seating relatively roomy, but third row seat is a torture chamber for anyone over ten years old. Overall, car has been lackluster and boring. I had a Nissan Murano before this vehicle and that was a much more exciting car to drive. This time I bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8 and, other than the gas mileage, this is one hairy ride!"
acura,mdx,2006,enlightenedacuraguy, 07/20/2007,Not True Luxury,neu,"This vehicle is overrated, not true luxury. No backlighting on the steering wheel buttons so you can't see what you're pushing in the dark, not even an option. A/C controls are in an uncomfortable place, and rear controls have to be reset every time you restart engine. Battery died 4 months after brand new. No back heater in passenger seat, not even an option. Power seats are far inferior to the seats in my '03 Tahoe. There is no 12v outlet for second row passengers, except the one in the bottom of the center console, very inconvenient. No power folding mirrors. It is very uncomfortable to drive long distances for a male, 5'10"", arms fall asleep after about 1 hour, and not enough leg room. "
acura,mdx,2006,Alex, 10/24/2005,Very reliable car,pos,"I have my MDX for one week. I already owned an MDX before that was excellent. Drives great, silent engine and good navigation system. the Rear entertainment system is a life saver with small kids. Since I bought the new MDX I hear the wind noise in the car when driving at 70 mph. Unusual, specially that I owned one before. The navigation system is improved however seems less accurate than in the 2004 model. Fuel consumption is moderate at 14 mpg. "
acura,mdx,2006,L Tunner, 10/15/2006,Great Vehicle for Shopping & Road Trips,pos,"This is the second MDX I've owned, and I love MDXs.  Perfect for our active lifestyle..my aunts and cousins call it our touring/shopping/eating machine. Navigation system is great for road trips and seeking out new sites.  Comfortably accomodates 5 shopping queens. Large cargo area has carried everything from 5 large dogs..club chairs..bags of mulch..lots of shopping bags. Performance, reliability and safety features are excellent.  "
acura,mdx,2006,richard nelson, 12/16/2005,MDX,pos,this is our 14th acura and they just keep getting better
acura,mdx,2006,Frank, 12/24/2005,Great vehicle,pos,I hads a 2003 MDX. This model is very similar and still has the same reliability. I love the voice activity NAV system. Also the blue tooth capability. 
acura,mdx,2006,Jacklemind, 07/13/2009,Awesome Drive - Love it,pos,"I recently brought a certified MDX.  I love the drive, it's powerful, fun to drive.  Gas mileage is not bad, considering it's a luxury offering.  The dashboard was not hard to figure out, however, the sound system is not that great, although it has BOSE speakers, it does not deliver the punch.  No Aux input (newer cars have it) - bummer.  Spacious interior, although 3rd row seating is not for adults - it's more a 6 seater than 7.  All other features are great, independent rare AC - love it.  Cargo space is not good with 3rd row seats up.  Would recommend buying a cargo net, otherwise, things will be all over the cargo area."
acura,mdx,2006,Cathy and Frank, 06/23/2006,MDX Review,pos,The Navagation System has come very handy during some of trips to unknown places. The system always knows where we are and provides excellent directions.
acura,mdx,2006,Marc, 10/18/2006,Best choice for third row seat 4wd SUV,pos,"I have 3, soon to be 4 kids. But this is the secondary kid hauler to the minivan. The MDX is incredibly comfortable with just the right amount of refinement to be attractive but not overdone.  All my kids are comfortable in the third row (tall 6 and 8 year olds) with moderate room behind 3rd row. Gas mileage has been 17 city and as good as 27 on the highway. Fold down seating is quick and easy. Stereo is good, not great. Runs fine on 87 or 93 octane."
acura,mdx,2006,johnny wishbone, 10/08/2006,"First Acura, Awesome SUV",pos,This is my first Acura and I'm thrilled with it to say the least. The MDX handles like a sports car and has the comfort of a luxury vehicle. The interior is well thought out and the XM radio is a big hit with the family. The navigation is excellent and easy to use. The voice recognition is excellent once you learn the proper commands. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a midsize SUV.
acura,mdx,2006,klin, 11/18/2006,This car certainly has room to improve,pos,"The ease of driving and handling was what attracted to purchase this vehicle.  On May of this year, I bought a new Toyota 4runner 2006 before I purchased the MDX. In my opinion, 4runner is a better built vehicle overall.  The interior of the MDX is slightly cheaper, and I found the cover of the door knob actually moves a little bit instead of fix to the door, a small but annoying defect, and the interior looks cheaper comparing with Toyota.  The back door of MDX can not close completely without slamming it.  What a pain... If you just try to be a little bit gentle on the car, then the door won't close properly.  In comparison, The 4runner has automatic door closer, and quality is awesome. "
acura,mdx,2006,SoccaMomma23542, 11/02/2005,Nice Car,pos,I received this car last month because my husband received a promotion and wanted to give me something new. Mine is the fully loaded Touring model. Decent car.
acura,mdx,2006,jennifer, 06/09/2008,LOVE my MDX,pos,"I love my car.  I am consistently getting between 18-20 MPG, which is great for a 7 passenger vehicle.  Quality of finish is great.  Has everything I would ever want in a car.  Navigation easy to maneuver.  Heated seats work well.  XM and Bluetooth both work well also.  My 6' teenage son is a little cramped in the back seat--mostly because he slouches.  Wish there was sunglasses holder, but center console works fine.  Automatic closing hatch would have been a nice feature, but all in all, this is the best car I've owned.  I have been looking around for something with same features and 25 mpg in the city... can't find anything that compares!!!"
acura,mdx,2006,LZ, 06/17/2008,Zacura,pos,"In 18 months of driving the MDX, not a single item has needed repair - we had a leaking tire once, but the dealer removed the nail, patched the tire, and didn't even charge me (and we only knew of the condition because of the dashboard warning light). Great ride, sporty handling, good acceleration off the line, does everything right."
acura,mdx,2006,TR, 12/29/2008,"So far, so good!",pos,"I just bought my MDX after owning an Yukon & Odyssey. I loved, loved, loved my Yukon, but the MDX is neck and neck. I certainly have more options with the MDX and paid a lot less. It's the perfect size for me to haul my 3 pre-teens and their friends around in. I don't give anything  a 10 rating, so consider my 9 your 10. Would highly recommend it. The back lift gate is light enough to close. No need for a power lift gate. "
acura,mdx,2006,blackjack, 11/05/2005,Great Family Vehicle,pos,"An avid Honda fan, I decided I was at the age where I deserved a little more luxury. However, with two kids and two dogs, a sports sedan wasn't going to cut it.  Our MDX is so smooth and fun to drive, yet it offers all the things we need as a family. It is very spacious and feels sturdy and responsive on the road.  It brakes well and handles rough roads easily.  The gas mileage is suprisingly good for such a large and powerful vehicle. We use regular gas most of the time, and the gas mileage does not appear to be affected significantly.  We enjoy our MDX very much and feel safe in it.   I highly recommend purchasing the optional side molding as we did - I do not have one ding to speak of. "
acura,mdx,2006,Snow, 12/25/2005,First SUV,pos,"This is the third Acura I have owned.  It is great vehicle. Fun to drive, handles well in ice and snow.  Great sound system.  Over all I am very happy with the MDX.  This is my first SUV, and I wouldn't go back to a car after driving this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2006,mdxfinally, 01/10/2006,Love it!,pos,"Have owned an Acura Integra for 14yrs. but with two kids, needed a bigger car. This was perfect! Love the drive, visibility, and safety features. Could do without the cheap plastic wood accents on the interior, but otherwise love everything about it!"
acura,mdx,2006,Tom, 02/04/2006,TomO's MDX,pos,We have had this car since June 05. The fit and finish is perfect Other than the less than perfect gas mileage I wouldnt change a thing.  We only have 2200 miles on the car.
acura,mdx,2006,Gregory Volkov, 02/06/2006,Fun to drive,pos,It is my second MDX. I love this car so does my family. For the price it is the roomiest and best SUV on the market. Fun to drive and easy to maintain.
acura,mdx,2006,Tina, 03/11/2006,Ok so far,pos,"I needed the space so I traded my 04 TL- I am dissapointed in the lack of power, compared to the TL, however the layout is nice- I hate where the parking break is- its in the way of stretching out my left leg.Wish the stereo was better and illuminated, and placed higher on the steering column. Clock should be where heat display is. Wish the nav. creen was programable as  to what is displayed.I like the look of it but would like to see the front end redesigned. Gas mileage is acceptable for such a roomy SUV. I wanted white with a black interior but, your stuck with the light colored interior WHY?? doesnt acura change the limited color choices? I hate the light interior- it gets too dirty"
acura,mdx,2006,2XMDX, 03/26/2006,2006 MDX,pos,"In upgrading from a 2003 MDX, it came down to getting an MDX 06' versus a competitor which I found not as powerful or fun to drive as the MDX. This was an upgrade since we did not have the Navigation feature which I highly recommend.  The MDX is a joy to drive (suspension).  I am very happy with the slight modifications that they have made to the interior layout (although the competitor's interior is much more plush).  Obviously, being a repeat customer speaks for itself in the level of satisfaction."
acura,mdx,2006,The Ack, 05/06/2006,The Ack,pos,"After owning a 1994 Acura Legend Coupe, this new addition to the family was no surprise of it's greatness.  I have been exstremely pleased and the expectations continued to be met each time I start the MDX up. "
acura,mdx,2006,m2, 05/23/2006,2nd MDX,pos," This car fit our needs and the opportunity came up to trade in a 2003 MDX (touring with RES) for the 2006 MDX (Touring with Nav&RES).  I took the opportunity to upgrade to Navigation & RES and am so happy I did.  The car is fun to drive and meets our families need.  Obviously I am happy with the MDX or I would not have been a return customer.  The Navigation makes trips really stress free and although I don't have a bluetooth phone at the moment, I can't wait until I start using this feature."
acura,mdx,2006,Jenina, 06/30/2006,I Love My MDX,pos,"I checkd out my MDX for 3 months before I purchased.  I definitely did my homework before I bought this vehicle, the only opponent to the MDX was the Lexus and the deciding factor was when I realized that every option added to the Lexus would cost atleast another grand!  With the MDX all the goodies were included."
acura,mdx,2006,Brad, 07/04/2006,MDX Rocks,pos,"We love our new MDX. Fun to drive, extremly comfortable, and as reliable as any SUV on the market.  Engine is very impressive."
acura,mdx,2006,Jim Haynie, 07/10/2006,"Great Vehicle, but could use improvement",pos,"The vehicle is great riding higher than the Acura RL.  Acura uses standards across all cars on items like placement of controls and heights of arm rests.  However, this vehicle is clearly not the flagship car.  The RL has much better features, but you can't put in a new TV in your RL.  I love the vehicle but miss some of the features of the RL. MPG is closer to 14 city and 24 highway. Nice interior, but not as fit and trim as the RL.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Tracy, 07/13/2006,The best SUV ever,pos,"Granted I have only had my MDX for less than a month but I LOVE THIS SUV.  It is the most comfortable, the most convenient interior vehicle I have ever owned. I have had 3 Lexus before this but now I am an Acura customer forever."
acura,mdx,2006,Sam, 07/13/2006,So Far So good.....,pos,Just purchased this vehicle for my Wife and now I am so jealous of her since she gets to drive it everyday.  Overall car can't be beat as it has so much bang for the buck.  Nav system is great and a lot of fun to interact with. Car drives incredibly smoothly and power is available as soon as you need it.  I am having a hard time keeping the speed low during break-in. Owned 1 Acura before and loved the service and care of brand.  Matches to any German brand in my books. Buy this car and you'll see what I mean.
acura,mdx,2006,Jim, 07/24/2006,Great SUV,pos,"This is my second MDX, and I think it is the best car out there."
acura,mdx,2006,awesome car/price, 07/25/2006,Dream come true in 4 wheels,pos,"I purchased this vehicle at ryan's open road acura in New Bruinswick, NJ. the sales person Mark Gershmann was tremendously helpful and did the best he could to make the shopping experience a one of a kind. i bought the silver with black interior with navigation for $36,602 which included the $615 destination fee.(they threw in the splash guards for free) it was an awesome deal i couldnt refuse. the car dealer's instaquote system is great! The best price paid for the car."
acura,mdx,2006,LovemyMDX, 08/09/2006,I Love This Truck!,pos,"I saw this truck on the highway when it first came out and had to know what it was. I loved the look. Then I did research and found it was one of the safest SUV's with it's wide wheel base. When my husband and I went to test drive it I didn't. I just knew I loved it. So when I picked it up after ordering the color I wanted I enjoyed it more than ever. I just love driving this Truck. My 3 vehicles before were a 77' Camaro, 84 Trans Am, and a 93' Camry. It has great room for the kids and vacations. Plus it's very easy to clean."
acura,mdx,2006,Bill, 08/18/2006,Very Pleased With This,pos,"I really wanted a TSX, but with the kids and boat, etc. that became impossible.  I test drove this vehicle and could not believe it was an SUV.  It handles (no kidding here) almost as good as my Audi A6 (don't laugh . . . really!)  Very comfortable.  Don't bother with the DVD package .. . you can buy each kid their own for a lot less.  NAV however is well worth it.  Surprisingly good voice recognition.  Plenty of power (surprised here also.  Bose system okay . . . Definitely get the Acuralink for Ipod . . . works GREAT.   Some things don't make sense however, no lighted controls on steering, placement of clock . . . but next version expected to be better.  A solid purchase.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Love the MDX, 10/16/2005,My MDX,pos,"The MDX is a very nicely built car. It is comfortable and rides like a dream. It is quiet and accellerates nicely without any laboring.  Its gas mileage is good for the size vehicle. It does however lack some amenities that I think should be standard on all models since this is a luxury car, ie. power liftgate, memory seats and mirrors, telescoping steering wheel, power passenger seats."
acura,mdx,2006,Chicagomom, 12/19/2005,Happy with new MDX,pos,"We bought the new MDX to replace both an Odyssey and a Mercedes E320 because we're moving to the city and we like to go to the mountains. The MDX is easy to drive, has plenty of power, intuitive controls and dash, and great navigation system. For its weight, not bad mileage."
acura,mdx,2006,Paul, 01/13/2006,Awsome,pos,I've driven over 10 vehicles for last 12 years and this MDX was the only one I purchased same one twice since 2001. Both were black exterior in 2001 & 2006. Strongly recommended for either wives or husbands.
acura,mdx,2006,Richard Roman, 01/15/2006,Repeat Acura buying,pos,"I find the MDX is fun and very comfortable driving, very responsive in accelerating when needed. I have had five of us riding in and the four said if they had the money, will go for MDX. This Acura is my third, 1987 Legend, 1998 4door Integra, and now 2006 MDX (no GPS touring)."
acura,mdx,2006,AED2491, 02/19/2006,"Love the MDX, hate the mileage",pos,"I love the MDX. I drove a company car for years, and switched jobs so I had to purchase a car for the first time in over 10 years.  I purchased it due mostly to the fact that it was the best- fitting SUV for me. (I am 6'4"" tall, so the leg room was what led me to the MDX).  Looked at other mid-size SUV's (Toyota, Volvo, VW, etc.) and others were just too small for me.  All the features in the car are outstanding!   "
acura,mdx,2006,carolinaeagle, 03/02/2006,Typical Acura Quality,pos,3rd Acura owned - and there is just something about the fit/finish to an Acura that stands out.  Love the performance and handling of the MDX - drives better than a lot of sedans.  Interior design/layout is perfect.  Love the quality that you see everywhere. Sage brush pearl is an awesome color.
acura,mdx,2006,happyMDXowner, 03/02/2006,What a truck!!!,pos,"I was in love with MDX since it come out in 99 and finally have one on my driveway. It proved everything I have expected and more. Very nice size, plenty of guts and excelent quality. Dealer was great too. Wife loves it too and it equally comfortable for both of us. Looked at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus and MDX tops them all in my eyes. Great value, highly recomended for both men and women alike"
acura,mdx,2006,paratrooper1, 03/08/2006,Love this Vehicle!!!,pos,"My wife and I must have looked at every suv out there when we were in the market to purchase one. We have always liked the MDX but we just figured that we would find something that we would like better. Well, we didn't. We were going to get the Volvo XC-90 but it just didn't drive as nice as the MDX and the seats were not as comfortable and also it had very bad reliability ratings in Consumer Guide (as well as most of the European SUV's did). But as I said before it was just the perfect fit for us and what we wanted in a suv. "
acura,mdx,2006,Duane, 03/08/2006,I LOVE MY MDX!,pos,"I have driven the MDX when it first came out; however wasn't in a position to buy due to my enthusiasm with the TL.  Coming from a Honda Odyssey, I found it necessary for me to continue to have the space for me and my children while expanding my versatility with it's all-wheel drive capability.  Now my third Acura owned, the Acura MDX provides for me the luxury and performance I desire; the necessity of satisfying the soccer and vacation trips, and the comfort of owning a truly reliable vehicle."
acura,mdx,2006,Tina, 03/17/2006,GOOD SO FAR!,pos,"I ONLY HAVE 50O MILES ON MY suv. but so far,  I love the cozy interior, and the way most things are layed out. It drives quiet on the freeway and acceleration is adequate. great bluetooth, navigation, and black leather feels like quality leather.I  Wish navigation was able  to display what I am interested in seeing. but systems gives great verbal directions when looking for destination. Heated seats are ok, not as hot as the TL. Please re-design the front end of this rig. Please give us the choice of dark interior for any color choice we choose.Cargo space is super large, and wide, nice back seat room, seats move easily compared to other 3rd row seat SUVS. "
acura,mdx,2006,Laura Petit, 03/16/2006,Acura MDX,pos,"I owned a 2002 MDX, and traded it for a Toyota 4-Runner.  Within 6 months I was trading the Toyota for another Acura MDX.  I love this car, the ride, comfort and the look."
acura,mdx,2006,Jaybird, 03/31/2006,Best bang for your buck,pos,Best luxury/options package for your money on the market. Great ride and handling. Intuitive control panel. Fun to drive. 
acura,mdx,2006,DCruz, 04/02/2006,Great Vehicle!,pos,I love this vehicle that I even recommended my sister to buy one and she did.  The only thing is that I should have gotten the DVD Entertainment System.  
acura,mdx,2006,holly, 04/18/2006,My First SUV,pos,"I test drove all the SUV crossovers out there before deciding on the MDX. I love the width of the car.  Much wider than a Chev. Tahoe and the like. It is a smooth ride and handles very well. I love navigation which is something that I wasn't even interested in in the beginning, but after I test drove one with navigation, my mind changed.  Now I'm spoiled and will always have to have Navigation.  After driving a Chrysler 300M for several years, I am surprised at many features that my Chrysler had that the Acura doesn't.  Being a luxury car you would think it would have everything.  See below under ""suggested improvements"".  Other cars like the Lexus 330 had much softer/plusher seats too."
acura,mdx,2006,Susan, 05/17/2006,New Purchase,pos,"Just purchased my MDX, but am happy thus far.  In Austin, I bought it for invoice plus $220 for molding, wood steering wheel, tint, moonroof visor and roof rack.  Deals are occuring. Shop around."
acura,mdx,2006,Don, 06/09/2006,Best SUV on the market,pos,"Great combination of power, handling, and comfort.  Kids love the DVD system!  "
acura,mdx,2006,xprepairpro.com, 07/15/2006,Great SUV for sedan lovers,pos,"I wasn't wanting an SUV, I was really wanting a TL or an RL but room (2 kids now) means the 03 accord wouldn't cut it and the TL/RLs dont have much more room.  I have never owned an SUV but have driven a lot at an old job.  I didn't like the truck feeling of most SUVs so I didn't think the MDX would be so ""car-like"".  I was quite surprised when I test drove it at the dealer.  It had a lot of power and steering was very much like a normal car.  I wasn't as attracted to the MDX so much for style.  I like it very much, but still have my doubts about the front end.  Hearing such good reviews and safety and reliability reports, I drove the MDX off the lot the day I test drove it.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Tracer, 08/02/2006,Unbreakable!,pos,"It's a great drive, for a 'large' (it really is large, once you see it next to a CRV or something) SUV. Fuel-wise, we've been getting better milage on the highway than Acura states, in the city it likes to drink a bit.  Car's a little on the slow side (compared to our other vehicle, the 2005 Acura RL) but it's very heavy of course.  The car has never had problems, nothing ever breaks (unlike our previous Lexus, on which EVERYTHING broke within a year) and it just keeps going and going, especially considering my lead foot."
acura,mdx,2006,Tony, 09/02/2006,Best SUV ever,pos,I have had many cars over my life time. I have enjoyed many brands as well. This time I traded my TSX for my MDX. Everyday I enjoy the MDX more and more. Funny thing... my 24 yr son wants to buy one as well. So it spans the generation. You will not be disappointed!
acura,mdx,2006,econ1, 09/24/2006,Even better than the 2003,pos,"We had 78,000 miles of our 2003 MDX (which we loved - never any problems - still had the original tires, brakes, etc.) and didn't particularly like the looks of the 2007, so opted for a new one minus the DVD package, which we never used.  It's an unexpected significant improvement over the 2003 -- it's more quiet, LOVE the Handsfreelink, and the NAVI systems works even faster than the one in the 2003 model.  May have slightly more power, but the 2003 had plenty.  Added a trailer hitch to this to tow PWCs.  Have thoroughly enjoyed the XM radio as well.  We've already put 5,000 miles on this one in 2 months."
acura,mdx,2006,Josh, 10/02/2006,Best Mid Size SUV,pos,"I love this SUV. Best in Class! I test drove several competitors.They all were good. But for the price, value and for things that I was looking for in a Luxury SUVs the MDX was outstanding!!"
acura,mdx,2006,Diana S. Rumsey, 10/08/2006,Great Car!,pos,"Being that The Acura is my very first new car purchase, I did a great deal of research and comparisons.  I am extremely pleased with my decision!  The Acura MDX smooth & quiet to drive & holds curves well.  The interior is comfortable & very adaptable.  Both my husband and myself are physically handicapped and find the car to be a perfect fit for our needs."
acura,mdx,2006,R. Harris, 10/24/2006,Acura MDX: Delivers with Value,pos,"Just bought a EOY 2006 and what a value. Loaded it came in under $38K and then added a GAMIN GPS 52 for $500.00 saving $7,000.00. "
acura,mdx,2006,Outstanding!! by FOB, 12/09/2006,Outstanding!! by FOB,pos,"When I decided to buy a mid-size SUV I settled on test driving the RX 350, X5 and MDX.  I have owned the MDX for two months now and couldn't be happier with my choice --- performance, interior quality, and comfort are oustanding... all this for $7K less than the closest competitor."
acura,mdx,2006,Danno, 12/13/2006,AZ Acura MDX Owner's Comments,pos,"Great handling pleasure to drive vehicle.  OK mileage.  Quiet, solid, spacious.  Always wanted one, now I have one.  Like the way the vehicle is appointed with leather seats, and wood trim.  Fold down seats help and 3rd row conceals nicley.  Safe, luxurious, sporty, good HP, performs well on and off road (within reason... not a rock crawler). Glad I bought it.  "
acura,mdx,2006,Leslie Mays, 01/13/2007,Les' MDX,pos,"Driving experience with my 2006 MDX is hands down ""all stares"".  I drive for a living, so at the time of searching for a new car I became very selective about the vehicle I wanted to purchase, I had a few in mind but, when I ran across the MDX on the highway I fell in love with the looks at first, then when I visited the dealer and saw what it had to offer, I was taken.  All my friends love my MDX and for me the joy of knowing where I go the MDX will be there by my side.  "
acura,mdx,2006,laxdad, 10/31/2007,Black Touring Navi and Entertainment,pos,"First off we do love this vehicle and except for a chronic rear door sticking issue, this SUV has been a great vehicle, drives more like a car than a truck, plenty of power and comfortable, family loves XM radio and navigation is huge help when traveling. We got the running boards, pinstripe and rear deflector which really helps dress the look up. Gas mileage is as usual disappointing but expected. We avg 15 around town and just over 20 on the road."
acura,mdx,2006,Realtor, 05/08/2008,Great Ride,pos,The fuel economy is really not bad when compared with other SUVs. I average 19 mpg (more city than hwy). The ride is smooth and quiet. I am a realtor and my clients always comment on how comfortable this vehicle is. I enjoy the ride myself and only regret that I did not upgrade to the touring. The base stereo is really lacking and no passenger power seat is embarrasing in a vehicle of this caliber.
acura,mdx,2006,SouthernPeanut3, 07/22/2020,I absolutely love this SUV!,pos,"This is a great car! They last a very long time (if you take care of it). It’s great for traveling (especially in the mountains) and it handles very well! It’s very spacious and the music sounds great (compared to an Audi and Yukon)! This car is very comfortable. The only downside is that it won’t connect to newer phones but other than that, I love this SUV! This SUV has been one of the best I’ve owned so far! I definitely recommend buying this SUV!
"
acura,mdx,2007,Tony, 01/14/2007,Best in Class!,pos,"Wife and I were in market for vehicle with 3rd row of seating.  We don't like the large truck-like SUVs and also do not like minivans.  We decided to look into the luxury SUV segment and narrowed our choices to the BMW X5, Volvo XC90, LandRover LR3, and the Acura MDX.  After test driving all and reviewing the numbers, the MDX was the obvious choice.  Unbelievable extras for the money.  When compared with these other luxury SUVs, I would have had to pay around $60K to get the same amount of features.  Acura navigation currently head and shoulders above competition.  Love the combination of luxury, utility, and convenience.      "
acura,mdx,2007,nregier, 02/09/2011,Snow machine!,pos,"We love our MDX Sport. Smooth, powerful, stylish, great looks, handles like a sports sedan. We've had lots of snow and ice lately and this Acura handles it like a champ.
The vehicle stability control, ABS, big tires, and 300hp V6 make for a formidable all weather machine. Driving it inspires confidence. We get 14mpg in city, best ever is 24 on highway. "
acura,mdx,2007,JGumby, 01/11/2007,Germany meets Japanese SUV,pos,"I have about 1,300 miles so far and do enjoy it.  Tested RX 330, XC90, Touraeg and this is it.  Acceleration a little touchy at start, maybe software upgrade to transmission needed.  Ride is excellent, super quiet, luxurious interior.  I purchased base model and has great features for price point. Mileage about 19 mpg with mostly suburb driving. Mine came with Bridgestone Dueler tires with B/B rating, I would expect best quality for this vehicle. You get Mich. A/A when you buy other trim lines. Shame on you Acura.  Telescopic steering wheel could go another inch, I'm 6'1"" just to be safe."
acura,mdx,2007,jt, 01/10/2007,Good Value SUV,pos,"Good vehicle, good overall value. Handles well, lots of nice technological items inside. High seating."
acura,mdx,2007,ggsdrummer, 12/05/2006,Best Performing SUV for the money!!,pos,"I test drove the BMW X3, X5, owned the Honda Pilot 2006. Once I saw this new MDX I had to test drive it. The SH-AWD really is impressive. It corners under acceleration like nothing I've driven before. I'ved owned a couple BMWs and we just bought for my wife a 2007 328ci with sport suspension. I'm amazed at how well the MDX holds it's own with the little sports car as far as feel and road holding  under extreme cornering. Brakes are great. The third row is nice in a pinch for small trips."
acura,mdx,2007,RWM, 11/17/2006,"This SUV may be ""just right""",pos,"My land cruiser was too big, my FX45 was a lot of fun but too small for family trips, hopefully this is just right. Plan to spend a night in the garage learning the new toys. There is room for my wife's luggage, the kids and dad's luggage and the golf clubs. Not as fast as my FX45 but performace is as advertised and does not disapoint. Sport and Ent. package provide the technology and ride quality you want, toys for the kids, room and comfort for the wife and family. The styling is better and more masculine than last year. It looks like a SUV rather than a minivan. Looks better with side step running boards and roof rack."
acura,mdx,2007,Jeff, 01/04/2007,2007 Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"I find this vehicle to be exceptional in design, comfort, and responsiveness. My initial concern of possible road noise was unfounded. Rides very well. Only surprise was the original equipment tires were only DOT rated Traction/Temperature B/B. Disappointing for a luxury SUV. Had optional roof rack and cross bars installed since these are no longer standard equipment."
acura,mdx,2007,Vic J., 11/13/2006,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"Very nice vehicle overall, but not outstanding. Acceleration (off-the-line) is not very strong and feels only very slightly better than my previous '02 MDX. Once it gets going (around 3500 RPM) the engine comes to life. Don't see all the hype about SuperHandling-AWD - much better than the old model, but not any better than others such as the new BMW X5. Ride comfort great with the Active dampers! and front seats are excellent! - but fuel economy is a big disappointment - only getting around 12mpg city and 18 mpg highway at 75mph. (I have about 1650 miles on my MDX.) "
acura,mdx,2007,Jaya, 11/18/2006,"Wow!! Amazing, Best of All, AWESOME!!!",pos,"We test drive different SUVs in its class but  MDX has outdone themselves with excellent interior and exterior. While we enjoy driving this, people's heads start turning on the freeway.  It was a worth wait to get MDX sh-awd acura advance which has best performance and value. You don't have to think twice before buying MDX because it's got the whole nine yards. Go get it."
acura,mdx,2007,Al, 01/04/2007,A driver's SUV,pos,"About 3 weeks into my ownership, and I love the MDX so far.  It is probably the most comfortable drive of any vehicle I have owned, including luxury sedans.  I narrowed my choices to the MDX, Q7 and XC90 and the MDX won without too much thought.  And the value is outstanding for what you are getting."
acura,mdx,2007,Peter T, 09/28/2018,"11-Years-Old, High Miles, Still A Great Choice!",pos,"We purchased this with 140K miles, in immaculate, well-maintained condition despite being such an old, high-miles car.  It's a beautiful, well-made car inside and out, with great safety features.  We now have put +28K miles on it with no problems, including trips to the East and West Coasts (from KS).  The front seat comfort is amazing, and the second row seat comfort is great for all but people with very long legs.  The third-row is only for short trips or smaller than average people.  Short people in my family are comfortable there indefinitely but I'm 6' and I wouldn't want to be there for more than an hour.  The cargo capacity with the third-row down is excellent -- easily fits luggage and camping gear for four adults on a cross-country trip.   For an SUV, the power and handling of this are terrific and will put you off most other SUVs, even most new ones.  The acceleration is better than most sedans on the road and the braking is good.  It's almost a sports car!  But it's also a luxury car: very quiet and easy to control even cruising in high crosswinds at Western Interstate speeds.  The Navigation system is great but you have to buy a DVD from Acura if you want to update it from '07.  Although I highly recommend this car as a great used, high-miles SUV, there are cons.  It requires expensive premium gasoline, the gas mileage is lower than average in class, the leather on the seats is thin and fragile, the back-up camera picture is easily washed out by bright sunlight, the radio has poor FM reception with the stock antenna, and (like in many other Honda cars) leg movement is restricted in the front passenger seat by the dash-console design.  This came with a doughnut instead of a real spare tire.  There is room enough for a real spare unless you install a hitch mount like I did.  With a hitch mount you have to settle for a doughnut as your spare.
"
acura,mdx,2007,Kat, 11/02/2010,"Fantastic vehicle, but a few quirks...",pos,"We love our Acura.  However, after putting about 10,000 miles on it during a cross-country move, we have found a few disappointing features.  The leather seats are showing more ""wear & tear"" than I would expect for a vehicle this age.  The leather quality in my Subaru is far better!  The leather has pulled up from the center console and is loose.  The radio is a bit quirky, as it resets the radio stations randomly to the factory settings (and no, its not because of the Driver 1 & Driver 2 keys).  The paint seems to chip VERY easily.  A beautiful car altogether, though, and a smooth ride that easily pulled a large U-haul trailer through the Rocky Mountains!"
acura,mdx,2007,rslewis, 08/28/2014,07 Loaded MDX,pos,"We bought our 07 in 2014 with 100k for 14k out the door from a small dealer that only sells about 12 cars a year.. 

Had it checked out by a local Honda dealership and came back good except for the passenger rear sport shock was leaking and needed to be replaced... no big deal, until I found out that you can only get the sport shock from Acura at $700 a pop...
OK!!

My only gripe about the truck though, ours has sport, entertainment, tech and tow packages... the only thing it doesn't have is the back-up sensors that beep.
It's grey with tan interior and it looks awesome... you can tell its a solid truck when driving it, no rattles and very firm when in sport mode. Great SUV!
"
acura,mdx,2007,traeger, 09/01/2010,Good long term buy!,pos,"Looking at many CUVs, I went with my mdx. It is fantastic. Tight construction, sure footed ride and handling, spacious second row!, good entertainment package with fantastic features.  This is a very good all around car for all variations of travel, weather, and conditions.  "
acura,mdx,2007,BDAATL, 08/01/2019,Great in Every Possible Situation!,pos,"I bought a 2007 Acura MDX Feb of 2019 with 155k miles. Great vehicle! Everyone thinks it’s brand new unless I tell them & then they’re shocked. It has everything we could want or need. There’s room for family & friends. Lots of space for trips where no one is uncomfortable & everything fits. Took it on a 12 hr straight drive each way & it was the easiest drive I’ve ever had. The heated seats, reclining seats & personal temp for all in the first 2 rows is unreal & there’s still cup holders & storage for the 3rd row with more space than any other I’ve seen. All 3 rows lie down & there’s a DVD package that means we’d be okay if we needed to pull over to rest or chill out while camping. I’ve got the tow package & a lite weight camper which is great to hook up & get out of town for the weekend. During extremely heavy rains, rough terrain & ice you’re notified of which wheels are spinning & others grip right away. Feel very safe driving this, it has everything I wanted & so much more. I plan to keep this for a very long time. Before this my Mercedes ML420 was my favorite vehicle & I’m surprised to say I now have a new favorite that works so great for so many passengers at the same time. ❤️It!
"
acura,mdx,2007,JayT., 12/20/2006,My First Acura Vehicle,pos,"This is my first Acura vehicle, I previously owned a BMW coupe & am a current owner of an Odyssey. I primarily got this vehicle because of the value that was packed into this model. Comparing it with a BMW X5 (07- 3.0), this was a much lighter vehicle, lower cost & easier to handle. The ride was also quiet and the seats are comfortable. The third row seats' leg/shoulder room is better than the competition. Middle row seats are very comfy for the two outer most, however the middle one is not good for long travel. The driver seat is excellent in holding the driver and power seats have lumbar support. The sound system rocks! Navigation is easy to use & voice commands are very convenient."
acura,mdx,2007,SWANN, 11/25/2006,Acura RL on Steroid,pos,"Just picked up mine last week, black on black with Technology and Entertainment. So far I have put in five hundred miles. All heads turn. Drove during Thanksgiving trip, loving the bluetooth and live traffic info. State of the art GPS system."
acura,mdx,2007,Mr. Research, 12/17/2006,Car Man's Best Car,pos,"2007 MDX may be best car I've ever had. My previous cars were no slouches: BMW 540i (6-speed), M5, X5, and Infiniti FX-45. I loved all of them! This is very similar to X5 only leaves $20,000 in your pocket. This car has fantastic ride in comfort for most roads, and sports car handling on windy mountain byways. We love the voice controls for Nav, climate and stereo.  Stereo is best short of Audi A8 which runs $8,000. If you can find one, buy it loaded!  Taupe interior is gorgeous! Seats are sensational!  Power is adequate. Incredibly quiet too."
acura,mdx,2007,Barry, 12/25/2006,What a great car!!,pos,"After a couple of months, of trying to convince my wife to trade our 2004 Lexus GX 470, I finally wore her down and we (she) reluctantly bought the Acura. One of my concerns was moving ""down"" to an Acura from a Lexus. I was extremely wrong, this is one  high tech machine, the navigation system offers more features, but is much more user friendly than the Lexus, The entertainment package gives the kids the option of listening to their choice through the headphones while the adults can listen to something different through the speakers & handling on this car is unbelievable. You can even set the doors to lock/unlock at the speed of your choice & the remote to open 1 or all doors w/ 1 touch.     "
acura,mdx,2007,DLU, 12/10/2018,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"I really love my MDX. For the 11 yrs I've owned it, I have not experience any major mechanical issues.
"
acura,mdx,2007,NamPaiVong, 12/30/2018,Best car I've owned will highly recommend to buy,pos,"Car is very good for the price,bought mine March of 2017 with 150k now has 180k!still drives like a CHAMP! Has very good power for a big mid size SUV for 300hp it's worth it! I love the look because it has luxury and a sporty look!I bought it used at a private lot and I still have a 3 year warranty surprisingly! Only thing that went wrong with it at first was that mdx known for the corroded battery wires that needed to be changed,it clicked with a ticking sound that the car didn't want to start BUT POWER STILL STAYED ON and eventually car tech moved wires and showed me that it was corroded WIRES, it wasn't a biggy cost 38 bucks for wires at auto zone changed myself, and cats went out at 170k but changed them and found them for 120 for both front and back and took very long to change the rear because the amount of less room there is and all the stuff you have to move out the way, BUT I love the handling I can do 100mph turn on a 35mph freeway turn easily without spinning out! And I don't even have a sport version. I highly recommend for someone to buy that wants a next step up family car instead of a van! This car does the trick, went camping with family of 7 and a extra storage cargo on top of car and went up steep hills an rocks, gravel wont recommend to do that all the time on the rocky climate, but gravel or dirt roads ok.snow was great as well! But here in northern cali don't snow too much but mudding an all is great too.Love my mdx to death and my integra! ...got a car for racing and car for cruising/mudding lol.Soon I will retune and chip my ECU on mdx and race my mdx lol PROS: great on handling,performance, Is great for a Lyft XL I always gotten great reviews of 5! Because of the look of luxury!and picked up a lot of hot chicks!lol, good to haul,great space to do oil changes under the car and don't have to jack up the car  CONS: needs better in an out space for 3rd row, better gas mileage, a little more luggage room,think it should be a little lifted for off roading and all terrain tires. OVERALL CAR IS AN AMAZING MACHINE.
"
acura,mdx,2007,George, 05/19/2010,WOW!,pos,"One word, Wow! This vehicle does everything right. It is fun to drive, can haul 7 people, and can even tow my 3600 lb boat with absolutely no trouble. I replaced an Explorer with this vehicle and so far have been extremely pleased with how this vehicle performs daily as well as SUV duties. If you're looking for a CUV that performs like an SUV, look at the MDX."
acura,mdx,2007,sobrien1087, 01/20/2007,Absolutely love it!,pos,"Bought the complete Sport /Rear DVD package just before the New Year.   I highly recommend this vehicle.  It's a blast to drive, stylish comfort and a real workhorse.  Safety is a huge reason for owning this newest design.  You can't go wrong!"
acura,mdx,2007,schnell76, 12/05/2006,Amazing Vehicle!,pos,"Bought an aberdeen green the weekend before Thanksgiving and could not be more satisfied with it.  Great power once you get the rpms up.  The 5 speed should have been a 6, but it's not a deal killer at all.  For me the transmission has taken a bit of time to get used to.  I think it is geared more towards gas mileage until you get on it and then it really moves.  Gas mileage has been between 18 & 19 mpg and that is mostly in town driving.  Good for a 300 hp midsize suv.  The lack of a dimming rear view mirror is no issue at all.  The rear windshield is so dark that it is not necessary to buy the dimming mirror.  Love the way the AC/fan speed adjusts based upon the location of the sun!"
acura,mdx,2007,Mr. Mike, 11/29/2006,Absolutely the best mid SUV available,pos,"I'm one of those people who research purchases to the point of exhaustion prior to making a decision. Additionally I test drove all similar vehicles.  Nothing, and I mean nothing, compares with this vehicle for the price paid.  Everything about this vehicle is top tier, fit and finish, performance, luxury, reliability and safety.  I feel as if this vehicle is a bargin even at MSRP!  Acura simply has produced a excellent automobile at a great price."
acura,mdx,2007,Tommy, 11/06/2006,German-like,pos,"Picked up this baby on 10/19/2006.  Had returned my Lexus RX 330 lease that same day. Compared to the RX 330, the MDX is 6 inches wider, 4 inches longer, and 2 inches taller.  But given the size and weight difference, the MDX is almost as nimble as the RX 330. (It definitely much more nimbler than the Mercedes ML class.)  The ride is pretty good, but not in the class of the Lexus.  If maximum comfort is what you seek, you can't beat a Lexus.  Acuras are very German-like, they are built as performance vehicles first and foremost.  Luxury/comfort comes behind. The GPS system and controls takes getting used to. (At least for me, because my RX 330 had touchscreen GPS, the MDX uses a turndial.)"
acura,mdx,2007,Bob, 11/23/2006,Great SUV !!,pos,"Finally a luxury SUV from Acura with good performance. I now have 1000 miles on my 07 and am very pleased with it. It has very comfortable front seats, handles very well for an SUV with good power and acceleration. I use the manual shifting capability a lot and find it very convenient to use. The sound system is excellent. When I first got the car I found myself accelerating to 70 mph to merge with 55mph highway traffic. Then I realized I wasn't hearing any noise associated with the speed and that's why I didn't realize how fast I was going. The Nav and Entertainment systems are excellent and easy to operate. The kids love the larger DVD screen. Thanks Acura for a great SUV!"
acura,mdx,2007,krafty81, 11/23/2006,Just picked it up - wow!,pos,"Picked up the car 11/21.  Drove it about 300 miles on a trip right off the lot.  Very comfortable car.  Great side view mirrors, driving position.  Custom features impressive - you can design this car however you want.  Sound system very nice, navi is the easist I've seen, although the voice commands are a little rough so far for me.  Bluetooth is awesome, linked up my phone in minutes.  Acceleration is solid, especially in the 60+ range.  Averaged 20 MPG in freeway driving so far.   Added roof rack - solid metal rack, and sport running boards as well as D/N mirror.  Perfect family car.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Kevin, 12/10/2006,Great vehicle,pos,"I have had my MDX over a week now and love it.  Never had an SUV with the power and handling the MDX has.  Even in the comfort mode, handles like a dream.  Gas mileage has been fair. (17 MPG mixed hwy and city.)  Very fun to drive.  The navigation system is awesome.  Easy to use and many features.  Stereo system very impressive. Head lamps light the road very well at night.  Seats are very comfortable and the heated seats work very well.  3rd row seats are OK.  Great for kids or adults on short trips.  The rear entertainment is very nice.  Good screen and easy to operate.  Wireless headphones give great sound.  Would like to have seen the vehicle have a built in phone holder, and coin holder."
acura,mdx,2007,Fernando, 10/02/2006,The most Luxury good looking SUV,pos,"Wow, what can I say.  Far most better than the competitors, wow.  I do have to say that Acura has created the best in the SUV luxury class.  The 07 MDX does drive so smooth and very fast that you feel like you are in an airplane, its unbelievable, its incredible.  Buy it, you will keep it forever."
acura,mdx,2007,John, 11/16/2006,The 07 is the best,pos,"This is my 7th SUV and my 3rd MDX. The 07 MDX is in a class by itself. I shopped other brands. Handling and quick steering response are greatly improved. Interior and exterior are beautiful. The manual shift mode is fun. The driver's comfort and positioning with instruments and gear shift were well conceived.  I would have liked to have had items in the entertainment package such as electric tail gait and heated second row seats. 3rd row seats are still cramped. Missing are the automatic wipers, and auto dimming mirror (which didn't work with the privacy glass in the rear). This is a thrilling car to drive and own.  I wouldn't trade it for the more expensive BMW X3 or Mercedes."
acura,mdx,2007,Bob Crowe, 12/29/2006,Great mix of utility and fun,pos,"Great handling for SUV, plus plenty of room for this class vehicle.  The electronics are pretty intense, but learnable and the car is full of amenities.  Engine doesn't sound as sweet as most acura/hondas but it has plenty of power. The cabin is very quiet even at speed. Leather seating is quite comfortable. "
acura,mdx,2007,Disgusted Owner, 06/26/2007,Disgusted Owner,neg,"This car has been in the shop continuously. Driver door rattles, windshield leaks, interior trim was never fastened down, window regulator had to be replaced, steering wheel needed to be completely repositioned - one thing after another.  I never thought an Acura would be this poorly built.  The engine and handling is great, the interior is cheaply made and slapped together.  Gas mileage is poor but it is an SUV.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.  Dealer has worked hard to fix, but the factory sent them a lemon to sell me."
acura,mdx,2007,Mitman, 11/17/2006,Wow!! What a ride,pos,"I didn't have to test drive any other after I test drove the MDX.  I bought the car on the same day.  The ride is excellent.  I love the interior design.  With 300 hp, you will feel that pick-up.  I chose MDX with Tech package, didn't go for the entertainment package since I don't have kids yet.  Good luck."
acura,mdx,2007,Mark, 11/10/2010,Best vehicle I have ever owned,pos,Great handling and performance.  Lots of room in a moderate size.  Steering is too heavy.  Way better value than comparable German models.
acura,mdx,2007,Simon, 01/04/2007,I regret buying this car.,neu,"I have owned the car for only 6 weeks, and I have experienced the following problems. The right front door started to rattle the next day after delivery. After the door was fixed, the sunroof and the front passenger seat started to rattle. After these were fixed, the dashboard started to rattle. The AC compressor makes a loud thump when it starts, and it can repeat the start-and- stop cycle several times when you wait for the green light. The transmission makes knocking noises when both speed and rpm are low as if it were a 10,000- mile-old transmission. The back of the car produces a click sound when any of the doors is shut closed. The last two problems also occurred in the loaner MDX I got."
acura,mdx,2007,vroooom, 11/02/2006,Just buy it,pos,"I bought a TL after I had a Pilot, needless to say, I missed the room.  I have 2 small children.  This is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned.  It's powerful, quiet, refined, full of gadgets and so comfortable it pampers you. I'm getting around 23 mpg (90% 75 mph interstate driving).  No squeaks, no rattles.  Beautiful taupe interior.  My only complaint is the lack of automatic rear-view mirror.   Acura, thank you!"
acura,mdx,2007,alain, 10/07/2008,"Great, but not perfect...",pos,Bought this a year ago new and it's 13k later.  Don't let the 300hp engine fool you. This SUV has much less pick up than my 01 V8 Grand Cherokee which it replaced (I leave on 'hills' and the car can't stay 60mph on 5th and takes a long time to shift to 4th which is way too high rpm) - but slightly better gas mileage for a larger car (the onboard mile computer is off by the way).  Rear camera takes 10 sec when backing up (making it much less useful).  Also mismatching color bumper is tacky IMO for $45k car (I picked silver body which blends the best). Instrument cockpit is WAY too busy with DVD/nav system (and I'm a techy).
acura,mdx,2007,AB, 12/30/2009,Love it!,pos,"I leased Acura MDX in February 2007. Loved it from day 1. It is stylish, sporty, and everything I could have asked for. I can drive alone, or load family and friends and still enjoy the ride.  The one thing I don't like in Acura MDX are the front wipers. They stink! The wipers started jumping within few months of my buying the MDX and Acura could not fix it. So I am living with it. My transmission failed once and they fixed it because it was under warranty.  Anyway, I think MDX is a great car. I love every bit of it. "
acura,mdx,2007,Satisfied in TX, 04/19/2010,Excellent SUV,pos,"My wife and I narrowed down our choice for a reliable, slightly used mid-size luxury SUV to the MDX.  We made a great choice!  We considered a Mazda CX-9, Lexus RX 350, Toyota Highlander and Volvo XC-90 and the MDX topped them all in our book.   The MDX hugs the road incredibly better than any of the other SUVs, nearly driving itself most of the time.  The power from the 300 hp V6 is at its best from 40-70 MPH and makes interstate driving easy & exhilarating.  The interior quality far exceeds the other SUVs out there and it's tough to pass on Acura (Honda Motors) storied reliability and low maintenance. Gas mileage is average compared to others above, but the extra performance is worth it!"
acura,mdx,2007,Vladsly, 08/25/2010,One of the best cars ever driven!,pos,"AMAZING CAR! This is such a good car, I never want to sell it. It handles like a charm and it looks so good. Whenever I go to someones house they all say, Nice car! No doubt that when this one breaks, I will get another one. Great features include, awesome Navigation, Back-up Camera, DVD Player and MUCH more. I would recommend this car to anyone!"
acura,mdx,2007,J Short, 10/20/2006,Best in it Class,pos,"Just picked it up on Wednesday traded in my 03 this is atotaly different vehicle.  Power and luxury incredible, rides like a dream.  I testeed everyhting on the market and nothing is as nice."
acura,mdx,2007,Jake, 11/23/2006,Great Ride,pos,We never thought we would find a better ride than our 2004 Tahoe.This vehicle has a big car ride and handles like a sport car. We have had the new vehicle for a month and we have not seen another one on the road. I would find it hard to believe that there is a better midsize SUV on the road.  
acura,mdx,2007,New to Acura, 01/01/2007,Not a minivan,pos,"I told my wife the MDX had seating for 7, and she said we bought a minivan.  I don't think so.  With the more aggressive styling, and exceptional handling, this absolutely will not be confused with a van.  While not in the SUV class of my old 4Runner, I've come to the conclusion my time spent off-roading is in the past.  For the streets, you can't do better.  The fit and finish is excellent, there is little road noise, and electronic capabilities (Nav, voice, and sound systems) of the car are outstanding. "
acura,mdx,2007,Pete C, 01/06/2007,Nice car/SUV,pos,"Took the car from the dealer then drove 2000 miles over the past 3 weeks. Fuel average is 20.1. More quiet, comfortable & fun to drive than the 2004 I traded in. Great sound system. NAV has greatly improved. Really need to read the driving manual. Tried Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 but preferred the MDX ride, features & price.  Miss the automatic windshield wipers & hope I never need to replace the ""blue"" headlights. Highly recommend it."
acura,mdx,2007,zorro, 01/07/2007,2007 MDX a big winner,pos,"Great vehicle!   Comfortable and sporty ride, easy and very responsive handling (SH-AWD and ADS), very safe feeling vehicle, very good engine power, great Acura ELS Surround sound system (DVD-audio, Dolby prologic II, 10 speakers), very good speech recognition for Navigation, audio systems and Hands Freelink, front and second row seats are the most comfortable we have ridden in.  A first class SUV all around with abundant storage and passenger room.  Fuel economy on the sticker is very accurate. "
acura,mdx,2007,steve, 01/25/2007,Acura that meets expectations,pos,"Leased '07 MDX 2 weeks ago, have 800 miles so far.  With the exception of fuel economy (16 mpg of suburban driving), MDX is very much what is expected from Acura: comfort and good road handling."
acura,mdx,2007,Geo, 06/20/2007,Nice dependable car,pos,"I exchanged the 06 MDX for the 07 MDX.  I like the exterior and the interior, compare to the 2006.  The only problems is that with this 2007 the bumper front and back are plastic and makes the car look cheap.  I do not understand on a luxury $40,000 dollar car they would install a plastic bumper. Also, the car has too much wind noise and the steering wheel is unconvertible."
acura,mdx,2007,RS, 06/25/2007,Disappointed in NH,pos,We traded my wife's 02 RX 300 that never had one problem for 5 yrs. We wanted something a little bigger. The new MDX has 800 miles and the windshield wiper fell apart and scratched the glass. Also am hearing a series of thud sounds when shifting 1st to 2nd with little to no load. Additional rattles are coming from the rear shock area.  The dealer had the car for over a week and found both wipers defective and replaced the windshield. Also replaced the exhaust below the cat converter and replaced rear swing arm spring seat as it was damaged along with replacing the spring itself. We picked up the vehicle and heard the same noise. I'm thinking I should have kept the 02 Lexus.
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 05/18/2007,Unconvinced,neu,"We have done 2k miles in our MDX now. Other than increased cornering ability and better brakes, this car is a step back from the previous MDX. The steering wheel is seriously uncomfortable and the centre console hurts my elbow if I am resting my arm on it while steering. The front footwells have poor room. The motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm meaning performance is more theoretical than actual. For the NE the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road so it cannot be trusted at speed. This car may be good on a track for a suv but is seriously flawed as a family vehicle for the road."
acura,mdx,2007,LexThor, 08/01/2007,Some serious design flaws,neu,"Huge side blind spots make lane changes a gamble. Uncomfortable seats.  Dashboard angled steeply away from driver so in sunlight you cannot see the digital readouts. The 4 dash A/C vents almost close when you aim them to blow air at you.  And under powered - if you think the 300hp stat means this car will outperform a 265hp V8, a test drive will show this car powers more like a 210 hp V6 costing $15K less.  On the plus side, solid luxurious quiet ride and decent handling.  Perfect for soccer moms.  Not for inner city driving where you need power to zoom up hills and need to be aware of surrounding traffic in case of quick lane changes."
acura,mdx,2007,LC, 11/27/2006,Love it.,pos,"The MDX is a very smooth ride, easy to handle and extremely comfortable."
acura,mdx,2007,Dave, 12/28/2006,Acura hits a home run - again!,pos,"This is my second MDX - the first being an '02 Touring model with Nav. Drove it 77,000 miles with no problems. The '07 picks up where the '02 left off - more power, more comfort, and improved body styling. The Tech package provides a whole new level of controls that are voice-activated and user friendly. No more touch-screen input. I'm absolutely delighted with this vehicle. "
acura,mdx,2007,Jose A Ramos, 01/04/2007,07 Red MDX,pos,Comfortable ride although I've experienced a little bit of wind and road noise.  
acura,mdx,2007,Nicollette Mourot, 10/10/2016,Good car for long time user,pos,"I love my car!!!  This car has been well worth the money we spent on it.  It is beautiful, fast and elegant.  My car has 112 plus miles and has been faithfully maintained by local Acura dealership.  Still runs like a top and is still current.
"
acura,mdx,2007,TerribleJ, 01/02/2009,Fantastic,pos,"It is a fun SUV to drive. The engine is smooth, the white lights are super bright, the sound system is amazing and it does not feel like a big car behind the wheels. It handles amazingly well in the snow and would likely recommend it to anyone. I just went through a B1 service, oil change and tire rotation, which cost me $56. It seems fair compared to the maintenance on the Audi. We do a lot of highway driving and average 19 MPG and it took about 7500 miles before the service light came on. We have an Accord and Honda USA treated us well. We got rid of our Audi and went with a Honda product. We made the right choice. "
acura,mdx,2007,Debce, 01/07/2009,I love my MDX!,pos,"I have owned my MDX for about 1 1/2 yrs & have loved every minute of driving the 24k problem free miles on it! It is so much fun to drive; looks & feels luxurious so no problem pulling up to upscale places! I didn't want to give up space to pop things in the back and go so I keep the third seat down & purchased the rubber mat for the back. I have plenty of room while at the same time I am ""zippy""; easily pulling into parking spaces and getting around town. I love the navigation system, although it does need updating and the bluetooth is wonderful, although for some reason it keeps unhooking my Treo phone which the Acura people say is the phone's fault. LOVE IT & would buy it again."
acura,mdx,2007,wasatch7, 04/13/2009,2 years with the MDX,pos,"First luxury crossover SUV I have owned. MDX won out over the Lexus, and cost less for a very well equipped base package. Handling, power and ride are outstanding. Back seats are a little less comfortable for my tall teenagers. Back cargo area is very roomy, and easily expandable with 3rd seat folded and back seats down. I drive up snowy, often treacherous mountain canyons to ski in the winter. The SH-AWD system, coupled with the manual shift mode (for descents), is outstanding. The MDX is much better in the snow than 3 truck base SUVs, I have owned previously. "
acura,mdx,2007,Acurafan, 01/08/2008,I LOVE MY MDX,pos,"My husband and I fell in love with the MDX in 02; bought it and when we needed a second vehicle, got another one in 03.  Kept going and got the 07.  We wanted a change and test drove the X5. Nice ride but for the bang and the buck, the MDX was the clear winner!! I love the way the vehicle moves and the smooth braking action is awesome; not to mention the way it hugs the curb as I try to see what it can do... wow!!  No vehicle is safe but I feel a sense of security in my MDX.  Who knows... might be riding an 08 in the upcoming months.  I didn't think it was possible to improve on the vehicle but wow... they did!!!"
acura,mdx,2007,MDXOWNER, 12/20/2009,Second Acura and keep coming back,neu,"This is our second Acura (first was a 2005 TL) and I purchased the MDX for my wife because we needed more room for a growing family.  Its been two years and it still turns heads on the road (even mine after I park it) because the styling is simple, yet screams I have 300 hp under this hood.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with the Acura brand from a prestige, reliability and value standpoint.  The MDX is upscale and its easy to scoff at BMW or Mercedes because of the superb value of the MDX.  Acura has simple options and doesnt hold you hostage with multiple option packages in order to get what you want."
acura,mdx,2007,What Happened?, 02/07/2008,Terrible Tech!,neu,"Unlike the previous model MDX I owned, the new design has lost many extras and the bluetooth is extremely poor sounding! The sound is ported through the AM radio and it's extremely poor in the 07 and 08 models. I really miss the rain sensing wipers, the day/night mirror which is now finally included and the open bottom of the steering wheel to rest my hand on long trips. The ultimate insult is that darn Bluetooth. Company in the car just laugh at how bad it is when you cant understand people while driving over 40mph. So much for the ""technology leader""."
acura,mdx,2007,sap, 10/18/2006,Thanks for the classy upgrade,pos,"Thanks for making a SUV that won't make me look like a soccer mom! What a sleek looking  vehicle. Comfort level of all interior controls is perfect. I've only had it for a very short while, but heads are turning. This is by far the best SUV of 2007 for the price and STANDARDS that are offered. You can't beat it. "
acura,mdx,2007,Jed, 11/02/2006,Awesome,pos,"Beats every expectation.  Fast, nimble, great turning radius, and full seating for 7 when necessary.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Burt, 11/13/2006,Great Handling Balance,pos,"A great car for those that need the third row but love to drive.  What really sets the '07 apart for us is the handling on the Sport model.  Power is good enough, interior is beautiful, exterior is nice in black.  But this thing has fantastically controlled body motion, very little lean, good steering.  And the SH-AWD really works, rotating the car even at moderate throttle.  None of the ponderous SUV feel, understeer, etc.  We are coming from a BMW 528i wagon with a sport suspension, and the MDX is very pleasant surprise.  "
acura,mdx,2007,Todd, 01/23/2007,2007 Acura MDX Base Model,pos,"I've had my MDX for about a month now; traded in my 2000 Grand Cherokee. While I don't think this has the off-road capabilities of the Jeep, how often are you really ""off-road""? (Once in 7 years for me). The front seats are extremely comfortable and the ride is one of the smoothest I've ever had. Had a big snowstorm recently and I would classify the performance as ""decent, but not great."" I considered the Q7, XC90 and 4Runner as well. For the price, you cannot beat the standards in the MDX anywhere. Thought about upgrade to to Tech pkg, but expensive and will probably just get aftermarket Nav at some point for way cheaper."
acura,mdx,2007,New acura owner, 01/25/2007,New to Acura by gail,pos,"Researched the 07 MDX a lot before purchasing. It was worth the wait.  The 07 interior is much nicer than the 06.  We bought the Sport package and the leather upgrade was worth the price.  This car has a lot of pep and wants to go.  Can't wait to take it on a trip. The more you drive it, the more you like it."
acura,mdx,2007,chrismredsox1, 01/25/2007,Everything you've heard is true,pos,"Just took delivery of my '07 MDX sport/entertainment package SUV.  Traded in a Porsche Cayenne S.  The new MDX is just about as good as it gets.  The electronics integration is perfect, as per Acura's usual standard.  The driving experience is just beyond reproach for a vehicle with this size and flexibility.  The SH-AWD system with the sport package suspension gives you a great combination of pull through curves, precise handling and a smooth ride with the benefit of the sport suspension's active dampers.  You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!!"
acura,mdx,2007,Awesome!, 01/24/2007,Awesome!,pos,"I have owned over the past 5 years a 4.4 BMW X5, MB ML500, and Lexus GX.  By far this 2007 MDX out performs all the above - in all categories.  Handles like a BMW, but with more ""toys"" and better reliability."
acura,mdx,2007,car man need and suv, 02/06/2007,SUV that fun to drive,pos,I also test drove the X5 4.4 and Q7 4.2.  The MDX was just right.  All the stuff I need.  
acura,mdx,2007,Rich, 05/19/2007,NOTHING ELSE Compares!,pos,"Like BMW, Audi, WRX STI, only judge the MDX after it has a minimun of 8-10K miles.  Improvements in power, suspension performance, quietness, door seals/wind-noise occur. Fast, smooth, 300 HP. Experience 17-22.5 MPG. Computerized SHAWD/Delphi-Magneto-Rheological Shocks and Michelins, corner like on rails with no tire noise/squeal. Suspension allows powering through steep/fast turns like no other car. Comfort Switch allows MDX Sport a Lexus-Ride (leveling tar-strips!) or in Sport Mode, MDX will exceed any other SUV's handling capability. Min. hydroplaning and goes through snow like tank."
acura,mdx,2007,DisappointedOwner, 06/10/2007,Test Drive It Carefully... Major Regrets!,pos,"I have owned two other MDXs and loved them.  This one is a major disappointment.  The steering is tough.  The steering wheel is impossible to find a place to grip it comfortably.  The joystick navigation is annoying and distracting to use.  No touch screen navigation.  The rear/side blind spots are overwhelmingly dangerous.  You simply can not see out the rear/sides. The front seat feels crowded and I have to crouch down in my seat to see the front of the car. The rear view mirror appears to block 1/3 of the vision of the front window.  Overall, a very uncomfortable driving situation.  Test drive it for a day before you buy it.  A ride around the block won't reveal the problems. "
acura,mdx,2007,Telee, 08/20/2007,Some Major Issues with the New MDX,neu,"Rear view is extremely limited. Very small side view mirrors and late to upload rear camera do not help. Back up lights are almost useless. The seats become very uncomfortable if you are slender. A seam cuts across your rear, otherwise they would be great. Our 2001 Lexus nav system was better that the one they pack in the MDX. The auto window lock-out locks the driver out as well as the passengers. Our dog continually lowers the windows with his paws, and turns on the heated seats both front and rear. The tail gate is slick, but the rear hatch opening is too small to fit furniture that, otherwise, should fit. The key fob is not intuitive. Take a long look before you buy."
acura,mdx,2007,Seattle MDX Driver, 09/17/2007,Great experience so far,pos,"Four months and counting in this new SUV We wanted a fun to drive, dependable SUV cut out for city and commuter driving with two kids in the back seat and with the ability to handle snow when needed.  I think we got it.  Only a couple of downsides so far. The front seat makes my legs ache on long drives - in fairness I'm tall but not that tall.  Adjusting the seat to unusal configs helps when the legs start to hurt.   And the rear view camera has been useless to us so far, very hard to see in most daylight situations, at least for us.  I wish I had the rear sensors instead.    "
acura,mdx,2007,Gret SUV, 11/12/2006,SUV To Consider FOR SURE!!,pos,"This is a great SUV. I had done my research against Lexus, Audi, Toyota and Honda. This SUV offers a lot in standard features compared to other manufacturers which are all options. This SUV also has the horsepower of V8 competitors all in Acura's new 3.7L V6. This is definitely a light SUV you should consider and put on the list. I love being the only one on the road. The looks I get etc. We got the rare color Steel Blue."
acura,mdx,2007,Gary Luce, 12/08/2006,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"This is my first Acura and it sure is a pleasure to drive. Handling, braking are superb and rival my wife's Audi A6. The tech package has just about every bell and whistle you can imagine. "
acura,mdx,2007,sean, 04/20/2007,Don't be fooled,neg,"This is be our third Acura MDX and they have messed up a great vehicle.  From what used to be smooth revving motor we now have the refinement of a mid 80's buick 3.8v6 and I am being generous. Yes the car can handle but at a price of crappy ride quality, the comfort level on the sport suspension is like driving a pogo stick and the sport setting is ok as long as the road is smooth.  Interior fit and finish looks to be GM level, the exterior fit of various bits is not up to current detroit levels.  The steeering wheel is asinine with lumpy bits here and there to grab and the bottom of the triangle means there is nowhere to hold when turning a corner. If I could return it I would."
acura,mdx,2007,ralph frank, 12/03/2006,Disappointment,neg,"After purchasing I realized this vehicle is very overpriced for the quality you receive. Options such as rain sensitive wipers which were on my 06 MDX are no longer available. Very poor fit and finish, not to mention orange peel paint which the dealer assures me is normal. The vehicle is tight and confining. I think I will trade it in before I lose too much in depreciation. I would have to sum up to say that this vehicle is a very big disappointment."
acura,mdx,2007,RJ, 12/12/2006,Love my new MDX,pos,"Just purchased an '07 MDX with Tech package.   The more I drive it, the more I love it.  Takes some time to get used to all the buttons, features, voice commands, and the GPS system, but the car rides awesome, nice pick-up, and everyone just loves the look of the car.  AWESOME!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Cale Jones, 01/08/2007,Out handle an S2000 with 3 kids,pos,My MDX elite in sport suspension mode will out handle my S2000. The way that the Super Handling AWD works with the magnetic suspension it is like you are on rails. 
acura,mdx,2007,Love it, 01/28/2010,2007 Acura MDX,pos,"After a long exhaustive search for a luxury SUV which was not too big and not too small, we found the MDX. We purchased our 2007 MDX used but in like new condition. Could not be happier with the performance, style and overall handling of this vehicle. This performance vehicle is quick, agile, easy to drive and stylish all in one package."
acura,mdx,2007,John Arran, 01/10/2007,Awesome vehicle,pos,Amazing on gas for size & 300hp! Ride is exceptional and the gadgets inside are very enjoyable. Love this vehicle! Ride is best in category!
acura,mdx,2007,Pat, 10/27/2006,Incredible SUV!!!!,pos,"The prelim reviews were great, and I anxiously awaited its arrival at dealerships.  I purchased one the 1st day they were available and have no regrets!!!  It's incredibly powerful.  After driving a suburban for 6 years, I'm loving this SUV!  I've driven some great performance vehicles in the past, and this is definitely at the top."
acura,mdx,2007,daf, 10/29/2006,Best of the Best,pos,From its luxurious ride to its fit and finish - this is truly a luxury SUV.
acura,mdx,2007,Acuraman3, 04/07/2007,No Wonder it's the 2007 SUV of the year,pos,"Having owned two Toyota 4Runners, a Lexus RX 300 and a 330, and having test driven the 2007 Lexus GX 470 and the BMW X5, I can say without a doubt that the 2007 Acura MDX - my very first Acura - is the best SUV I've ever driven and much more fun than driving a car.The SH-AWD system alone is worth the price of ownership. The first big snow will make you smile because you'll feel safe and secure, knowing you'll get wherever you want to go.  Actually, the SUV handles beautifully any time of year and Acura reliability means it won't be in the shop every month. The interior is classy and elegant. Comfortable and intuitive, it's the best SUV I've ever driven. "
acura,mdx,2007,Lewis Lake, 09/24/2007,Vibrates Like Crazy,neu,"This vehicle vibrates badly at speeds above 60 MPH and has noise issues with rear windows down. Although the performance is great, it corners well, and acts like a big 4X4, it's no fun when the vibration pushes you off the highway. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem and Acura said they have company cars the act the same way. ""Live with it!"""
acura,mdx,2007,EricExcaliber, 06/02/2007,"$5000 More, Get an Audi Q7",neg,"I real let down by Acura across the board. I have always bought acuras, but this is one is a let down. It eats gas like a V8, it is very umcomfortable if you are over 5ft. It is very bumoy and the engine struggles. 300hp feels like 220hp. The center console will have you feeling you about to blast off into space. And the pencil thin steerling wheel feels like a 1980s Car. The third row cannot even fit teenagers at all. It does fell like an suv, it is more like a wagon. And for this price tag you can get an Audi Q7 fully loaded,or even a BMW X5  So i did , A Audi Q7 4.2 premium."
acura,mdx,2007,Dollar & Sense SUV, 04/25/2008,An SUV with Dollar & Sense,pos,"I bought the car on January, 2007, have test driven X5, FX45, and Lexus; however, this MDX has out performed all these others by the quality, luxury, and value. Beautiful car, consistent build quality, powerful performance."
acura,mdx,2007,Marco5, 10/23/2006,By far one of the best SUVs to date!,pos,"I love my new MDX, it drives like a true luxury vehicle, very well built, very low wind noise. I absolutely love the engine, pulls like some V8s with better gas mpg. I was a little bit skeptical about trading my 05 for it, but I'm glad I did. Price tag a little higher than expected, but I believe the car will live up to its price several times over, as many of my other honda vehicles."
acura,mdx,2007,D Taylor, 06/19/2008,Great car - horrible gas mileage,neu,"Overall this is a great car.  I've strictly driven Lexus for the past few years due to the quality and comfort of their cars/SUVs.  This is my first foray with Acura.  The MDX is a nice car that is easy to drive, although had I known I would only be getting 12.5 mpg around town, I probably would have purchased something else.  Oh, and the back-up camera does not work well if too much light is shining on the back of the car.  "
acura,mdx,2007,vc, 07/17/2008,luv my mdx,pos,"This is my second MDX after surviving a roll over in my 2003. That car saved my life. For comfort, dependability, class and affordability, this is the car for me!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Alex, 08/08/2008,Ups and downs,pos,First thing I want to say is that this SUV handles better than a vehicle this large and high should.  Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids.   The interior space is very nice.  This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips.  I am disappointed in the gas mileage.  In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg.   On the highway I get about 19.  Nowhere near the numbers advertised.  I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood.  I have had panel gap issues.  
acura,mdx,2007,Kate, 08/28/2008,my truck drives better,neg,"Between Sept 2007 and April 2008 I had 3 sets of front tires, 2 sets of back tires and it drives worse than my Tacoma!  I jumps from side to side over bumps. It's unpredictable on stopping. Honda Corp only tell me they can try and ""have it fixed""  It's been in 7 times in 8 months!  I stopped driving it in June.  Selling something to you that is broken then just ""fixing it"" is unethical.  I would suggest that NO ONE ever buy this car!!"
acura,mdx,2007,bowie, 09/11/2008,Not so good,neu,"Bought my 2007 MDX with/Tech pack in August 2007. Do not like it. The acceleration is sluggish, and the engine is noisy. The tech gadgets function well, but you have to take 20 hours to read the manual to learn how to use them. The navigation system comes with a very old map and POI database. You cannot find any place built after 2004. The navigation system also does not take latitude/longitude. The $3000 navigation system is not better than a $150 portable."
acura,mdx,2007,SteelerMan, 09/26/2008,Love At First Sight,pos,"I purchased my 2007 MDX just two days ago and LOVE it!  It rides like a luxury SUV but with the kick and sporty attitude of a TL or TSX.  The Technology Package blows my mind and I consider myself a ""techy guy""!  I am thrilled to have this vehicle!   "
acura,mdx,2007,Max, 11/14/2008,Great,pos,"This is by far the best SUV I have owned. Power on demand, luxury interior, gas mileage is all right. It is top quality vehicle, can't beat it."
acura,mdx,2007,Dr. T, 12/04/2008,MDX - Best SUV on the Market,pos,"I now have over 18,000 trouble free miles on my MDX.  It is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned.  Very comfortable on long trips.  Performance is even better with a K&N low resistance air filter."
acura,mdx,2007,kellycrewmom, 12/14/2008,Amazing!!! Love this car!!,pos,"I'm a realtor in Colorado and went up to Whale Rock Road in Bellvue to list a home.  The owner said I would need chains to get up and down the hills.  I took a chance and drove up the hill without any issues, used the manual transmission to drive down the switch backs and snowy, icey hills to ""civilization"" and the car basically drove me down.  When I would've shifted it was already where I wanted it.  I generally do not drive off-road and was amazed at the handling capability. This car is quiet, comfortable and stylish with plenty of room. (Love the storage and 3rd row seat when needed). I'm thrilled I have the MDX!  Thank you Acura you have a fan, who is living to talk about it!  "
acura,mdx,2007,mnozek, 04/06/2009,Drives like a dream,pos,This is the first Japanese SUV we have had in a while. Last SUV's were Yukon XL and Envoy XL. This beats them out by far. Performs almost as well as our Mercedes e class but has the utility of our Envoy. We always take this on trips and it is very comfortable. The third row is great for smaller children but not so much for adults. Best SUV so far. No problems within our almost 2 years ownership.
acura,mdx,2007,JLopez, 01/04/2008,Drives Like A Car!,pos,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX. The ride was not as luxurious as the Lexus, but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drives like a car! Drove it down to Disney from NJ; enjoyed driving too much that I didn't even bother stopping (except for gas) on the way back. The kids love the DVD so much that they did not even use with their game system. MPG wasn't that bad either (averaging 19/21). Overall, I think the build and ride is not equal to that of the Lexus, but they are still within very excellent standards. I enjoy using the manual mode for better acceleration on the highways. Regularly gets looks from people -  hopefully because of its handsome styling."
acura,mdx,2007,CLopez, 01/08/2008,What a fun-to-drive vehicle!,pos,"Traded in my 2001 Lexus RX 300 for a fully-loaded 2007 MDX, and what a difference. The ride is not as comfortable/quiet as the Lexus but one can easily get used to its comfort level. Drove down to FL from NJ, and was so comfortable driving that I drove straight on the way back. The kids loved the Entertainment System that they did not even bother using the game system which we can plug in the truck too. Averaged around 20-21 MPG on our trip, and was very pleased with the good acceleration on the highways. Constantly getting looks hopefully due to its handsome styling. My only complain is that the voice recognition falters. I really enjoy driving this vehicle (which I think drives like a car)."
acura,mdx,2007,Pleased, 06/23/2009,Best vehicle we've ever owned,pos,"I'm two years into a three year lease and I love this car.  The only thing I would change would be the shape of the grill...THAT'S IT.  Everything else is perfect.  Great performance, plenty of power and AWD when skiing, plenty of room for baggage, great MPG for an SUV, navi system is far superior to GM's Suburban (don't have to put in park to change your destination, etc).   Zero problems...just gas and oil changes.  One beautiful car...except for the sho-gun shield looking grill."
acura,mdx,2007,cvillemdx, 07/30/2009,no regrets,pos,"After months of careful research and test drives at BMW, Lexus, Volvo, etc. I settled on the MDX without a doubt in mind. I love the way the car handles, no stiffness or resistance in the steering or acceleration.  The interior design is a little Star Trek for me, but once I figured everything out, it is a pleasure to have all the extras (XM radio, navigation, Bluetooth, backup camera, etc.)"
acura,mdx,2007,FlewByU, 08/01/2009,I keep going back to Acura,pos,"I just moved to Germany two months ago and bought an 07 MDX from another military member.  It has everything I could want.  We just returned from a week driving through the Alps and this SUV is simply amazing.  Granted, I get to drive it much faster than I could in the states, but even at 120 MPH, it was rock solid. We need the AWD for the snow and the kids stay entertained with the AV system. Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV for family touring, with cool tech toys to play with, MDX can't be beat. "
acura,mdx,2007,Don, 12/18/2009,07 MDX / Tech pkg.,pos,"I bought a new MDX in 02 and was very happy with it. The few things I didn't like were resolved in the 07 redesign. For a sport ute I'm happy with the ride quality, reduced road noise, seat comfort, power and handling. At 38 K miles the AC quit but was repaired under warranty. The 1st of 4 Acuras to ever go in the shop for a repair. I don't like the vertical spoke at the bottom of the steering wheel where my hands want to rest on long drives. I think it's a bargain relative to the price of the BMW or Porsche. "
acura,mdx,2007,Tim, 01/18/2010,"Great SUV, love it",pos,"This was our first luxury vehicle purchase. We bought the 07 Sport/Ent with 18K miles from an Acura dealership (Certified). We compare it to X5, ML, and the RX and the Acura had many more features, and more value than the competitors. Sporty feel, good power once the rpms climb, nice interior. Wish the interior was more quiet at highway speed and the LED for the sport button and the trunk release button died but luckily replaced under warranty."
acura,mdx,2007,Cat, 04/08/2010,Great trip car,pos,"Love the MDX, it is very comfortable on the highway.  We are averaging around 21 mpg in mixed driving. We bought ours used and have had a problem with the driver's side mirror rotating down in reverse, then not coming back up to the correct position. Also, after driving a Lexus RX300 the steering in this SUV makes the SUV feel heavy, not as nimble as the RX300."
acura,mdx,2007,dsjunk, 02/02/2008,Review after 8 months,pos,"This is a great vehicle but... in the 8 months I have owned it Acura had to replace the windshield (flaw causing distortion), adjust 2 of the door handles (installed wrong), replace the muffler (broken interior baffle), replace a rear strut (failed), replaced the battery (dead cell), fix the dash and trim (installed incorrectly) and other minor items.  Mine has had horrible build quality, although my dealer is fantastic. I bought Acura because we have had great cars from Honda, but this isn't built nearly as well as my wife's Odyssey. But, no SUV out there drives this well. If you are considering, buy the SPORT, it's worth the money."
acura,mdx,2007,Rick From Crofton, 02/07/2008,Best vehicle in its class,pos,"We picked up our MDX in June 2007.  What a purchase! We compared all of the vehicles in the class and selecting this vehicle over all of the others from our perspective was a no- brainer.  Here we are with over 10K miles and we just love this SUV. It is so fun to drive. We got everything on the vehicle.  The technology pkg, the performance is unmatched. This vehicle has a powerful engine that truly delivers.  We did the head to head test drives with the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and other top brand crossovers so the buying decision was very easy thereafter. It outperformed everything.  Having had several Acuras in the past, the build quality is simply awesome. One test drive will sell this SUV."
acura,mdx,2007,bob, 02/10/2008,Great Car,pos,"Love this car!! I have had no problem in the first 4000 miles and am very satisfied with the overall experience with this vehicle. The ride is so smooth and the power is there when you need it.  The luxury, performance, and overall looks are worth the higher purchase price."
acura,mdx,2007,Anthony R., 02/15/2008,Top Notch!,pos,"I replaced this vehicle for a 1999 4Runner.  I also considered the Lexus GX470, BMW X5, and Audi Q7.  Extremely comfortable to drive, love the interior and all of the tech features.  First class!"
acura,mdx,2007,Rick, 10/25/2006,Just drove it from Canada to Florida,pos,"Bought it a week ago in Ottawa, Canada and drove it to Florida for the winter. 1400 miles over 3 days and it worked better than my 03 MDX but with close to the same gas mileage. Larger engine gives it a little more power but the interior fit and finish is the greatest part. Feels like a true cockpit and the Nav System was great. Far superior to the last model. Really enjoyed the XM radio and the sound system is fabulous. The new trip computer not quite as good as elapsed time resets with each stop rather than driver resetting it. Most features were easy to operate, very intuitive. Seats with lumbar support can't be beat and I tried them all. Thanks Acura."
acura,mdx,2007,Kat, 10/23/2006,Should be the 2007 SUV of the Year!,pos,"This is the SUV to own if you want an outstanding technologically advanced, fuel efficient car with all the bells and whistles plus some you didn't even think of.  In my opinion, the Acura MDX is the best value, best performer and offers the option of 7 passengers where many only offer 5.  This is a completely new model with zip and zest that will leave any man or woman feeling lucky to own.  I'm glad I waited and didn't order something else more expensive; it was worth the wait.  We'll just spend the money we just saved on a family trip to Australia next summer!"
acura,mdx,2007,Bill, 10/31/2006,Best SUV In Price Class,pos,"SUV handling is exceptional, lives up to marketing hype. Technology is easy to use, however expect a learning curve to master all aspects of manual and voice commands. Third row seating area is of margional use (small children). Excellent power at mid and upper ranges. No early build or mechanical problems noted."
acura,mdx,2007,rg, 11/07/2006,'07 MDX,pos,"Unbelievable value, the whole nine yards.  Build quality, performance, tech features galore.  ULEV to boot.  I can picture driving this SUV for ten years, it will probably seem state of the art for the first five."
acura,mdx,2007,First new car 12yrs, 12/18/2006,First new car in 12 years,pos,"The car is just beautiful.  I got the black cherry pearl sport, fully loaded.  It's like being strapped into a rocket, what power and handling.  The fuel consumption is higher than I expected but I was told that it would take several months before the true fuel consumption is realized, I hope that's true.  I love XM and if you love music like I do, I would highly recommend getting the navigation just for this option.  I haven't tried the sport driving feature yet and probably will not use much in the future.  I got the sport just because of the upgrade in leather.  The parchment interior looked too yellow, put with upgrade to sport, the leather looks much softer and not so yellow."
acura,mdx,2007,Sun, 02/01/2007,Overall a great car for its class,pos,"I looked into BMW X5, Benz M350, and Volvo XC90.   I lastly checked out the new MDX and fell in love with all the features the car has and its new look.  Definitely the most bang for the buck in every aspects compared to other vehicles in its class.  "
acura,mdx,2007,mesalum, 02/02/2007,Great 2nd Gen MDX,pos,"I purchased the 2001 MDX Touring when it was first available.  Kept it for a couple years and traded it on a Nissan Titan.  Now I am back with the 2007 MDX.  Wow is all I can say.  It's more refined than I remember the 2001.  I bought the Tech Package and I love all the gadgets.  The leather seems to be better quality.  This one seems quieter than the 1st gen.  I cannot wait for a long trip, we are planning a trip to Tahoe but there is no snow up there (Feb 1)."
acura,mdx,2007,murphys mike, 01/24/2007,Need a sports car and an SUV??,pos,"I just traded my beloved Infiniti FX for this MDX Sport. I drove the Acura just to prove to myself that my FX was still unrivaled in the world of upscale crossover vehicles. You gotta understand I loved my FX, but I loved my childhood sweetheart too and then I started meeting real women. Yikes!!!  The MDX Sport handles better than top of the line Porsche of my 70s youth. While not the briskest off the line, from 4000 rpm and above this beast will compare favorably with almost anything not in the ""super car"" category.   The blend of technology (too much to tell you about), comfort, utility, fit and finish is unrivaled.  Drive one, hear one, and make one go around a corner... then decide."
acura,mdx,2007,Corry, 02/03/2007,Best Midsize SUV,pos,"Compared with Mercedes ML350, Lexus 350, BMW X5  3.0, Volvo XC90.  Better than the ones compared to. With Mercedes and BMW everything is an option. I had a MB S430. I spent too much time repairing the vehicle. MDX comes fully loaded with all options. The audio system is excellent. It plays MP3s of DVDs. It can hold 6+1 DVDs loaded with MP3. 7 * 8.4 GB (dual layer) = approx 60GB of songs... AMAZING !! Quality of audio is also excellent.  Navigation rocks. MB navigation is like Mickey Mouse compared to this.  I never thought of being so happy of a Honda over the MB."
acura,mdx,2007,Tops No Doubt, 02/10/2007,Tops No Doubt,pos,Resisted at first but since it was the vehicle that my wife would be driving then it was pretty much her decision.  And her decision was just that.  Lets go buy the MDX.  Now I am a convinced owner of all the quality and comfort  Acura has to offer (which if you let my wife tell the story she already knew).  It is by far the most superior vehicle we have owned.  
acura,mdx,2007,TNCPA, 02/10/2007,Top-of-the-Heap SUV!!,pos,"With the exception of gas mileage, the new MDX exceeds my expectations - handling on par with best sport sedans, very quiet, rides better than most luxury cars.  Build quality very good. Improved overall from an excellent 2001 MDX.  Trip computer very inaccurate - overstates mpg by at least 10%.  MPG an actual 20.5 for 2000 mile trip, primarily interstate at 70-75 mph.  Surround sound system is excellent, perhaps better than my '04 Acura TL.   "
acura,mdx,2007,AcuraReview, 02/11/2007,Great job Acura!,pos,"Excellent ride and lot's of bells and whistles for the price.  Safe vehicle great for our growing family.  My wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months.  We purchased this car so she could have a safe, reliable vehicle that could also be great for kids and have some class/luxury to it as well!  Very happy with our MDX purchase!  The class leader in our opinion!!    "
acura,mdx,2007,Joe, 02/15/2007,Best SUV,pos,"This is a very fun and smooth SUV. I have owned it about three weeks, and have the best time driving it. The gas mileage is not the best but I can live with it. Do wish that the roof rails, side running boards, and side body moldings did not have to be extras, but they make the car look so much better."
acura,mdx,2007,MDX Dad, 02/23/2007,2007 SUV of the year!,pos,"I was looking for a vehicle for my wife and daughter.  I am the kind of guy that will research vehicles for months and months before making a decision.  After comparing the MDX with just about every luxury suv (ie, X5, XC90) on the market, the decision became easy.  The MDX has a luxurious feel but still has a lot of function to the design.  The technology is amazing and easy to get used to (my wife is not a tech geek at all and she is loving the nav, blue tooth, rear view camera, etc.).  Very safe vehicle.  After all the research I am convinced this is the SUV of the year, when luxury, quality, performance, and Acura's reliability are all thrown together.  Best vehicle we have ever owned!!"
acura,mdx,2007,Incredible by MBA, 02/28/2007,Fabulous Luxury SUV,pos,I drove the X5 BMW and the Mercedes ML class and neither car can hold a candle to my '07 MDX.This vehicle is as solid as a rock yet moves like a light jet. The technology is superb. We've put almost 1000 miles on it this month and I can't wait to drive it again
acura,mdx,2007,lsb, 02/23/2007,New MDX,pos,"Great style, power, pickup, handling, comfort.  Surprised how crips it handles for size of car.  Drives smaller than it is.  Priced better than competition for same features."
acura,mdx,2007,KC, 02/25/2007,Best New SUV Under $50K,pos,"As expected, Acura's attention to detail, outstanding quality and impeccable ergonomics live on.  The overall interior quality is terrific.  Love the handling prowess.  Takes curves like a sports sedan - well, almost.  Very good power once over 30 mph.  Very smooth suspension compliance but so much that wallowing and pitch/rolls dominate; spot on blend of comfort and handling.  Additionally, the navigation system is terrific and easy to use.  The upgraded stereo system is awesome, and the rear view camera is great.  Leather, sunroof and all the bells and whistles I could want.  Comparably equipped X5 was $14K higher - no budging.  Bottom line - best SUV available under $50K! "
acura,mdx,2007,Andy, 03/21/2007,Unhappy,pos,"This vehicle is very expensive, needs a lot to improve, power steering is very hard, wind noise, low fuel mileage, noise in front suspension."
acura,mdx,2007,rperret, 03/05/2007,Disappointed with steering,neu,"I just traded in my 2002 MDX for the New 2007 MDX and am about to trade again! The new car is significantly smoother to drive except the steering is so heavy it feels as if your are driving a truck 3 times heavier. The whole driving experience is that of a much larger car then the old one, but when I get out and look at it, it looks much smaller then the replaced MDX. My wife actually has a hard time parking in small parking lots because of the steering. This is a big negative.  The build quality is superb and there are lots of improvements, but be warned the driving experience is anything but nimble."
acura,mdx,2007,Cliff Kang, 03/05/2007,MDX is excellent so far!,pos,"Excellent vehicle.  Took it on a cross country trip from CA to NY with absolutely no problems.  With highway driving, I get close to 23 mpg, but when driving around town, I usually get about 15 (I drive pretty aggressively I guess).  Build quality and design is superb, and the options you get for the price compared to cars in its class is considerable.  Only thing that I'd really like to see are flat 2nd row seats, for better cargo storage.  But otherwise, excellent :D! I love my car.  I've gotten about 5500 miles on it so far in 2 months."
acura,mdx,2007,The wonder wheel, 03/11/2007,The wonder wheel,pos,I recently picked up my 2007 tech and entertainment MDX on 2-23-07. It has been truly a great purchase. I traded in a 2006 Mercedez-Benz that had multiple problems to an upgraded dream. All of the technology is great. I offer to drive my friends around just so I can feel the comfort of the seats. I am a stay home mom with 2 kids. This car has plenty of room for everyone. I highly recommend it.
acura,mdx,2007,Dr.A, 03/21/2007,Best SUV in its class!,pos,"In love with this car!  Gorgeous interior, heavy tech features without the heavy price!  Did a 7 hour road trip with family.  Wife was in back seat reclined back enjoying a movie with our son while I was listening to ESPN XM radio up front.  We had their temp set to 78 as they are always cold and I was feeling good around 72 degrees since I am always warm... very nice!!  Excellent acceleration and handling.  Previous review said they had heavy steering.  I do not have this problem at all.  This vehicle has surpassed our expectations and I would be very suprised if it doesn't win a lot of awards!!  "
acura,mdx,2007,Dax, 03/10/2007,"Great, but only time will tell.",pos,"I have had my 07 MDX for about 2 months now, I love the thing from its fun to drive to its looks. Only problem was a loose rear suspension bolt that made noise over some bumps. Dealer took care of that and now its as solid as anything out there. Fuel economy isnt all that great in the city but on the highway its very good. Its a new design so only time will tell what the recalls will be if any. But so far with 2000 miles on it its great."
acura,mdx,2007,Christine R, 03/10/2007,LOVE IT!,pos,"Just got the MDX.  Love it.  It is such a great car for me.  I have owned two Hondas in the past (civic and accord) and wanted another Honda but wanted more luxury than the Pilot.  So the Acura was the answer.  It's a great ride, everything I need.  I'm a 5'1 female and I love it.  I have a two and a half year old and we added a side rail (step) and glad we did, little guy can get in easier by himself and I use it to buckle him in without stretching."
acura,mdx,2007,Vitaliy, 03/21/2007,Unique!,pos,"This car is quite comfortable, with a 300 hp engine. A unique design inside and out. I love driving this car."
acura,mdx,2007,slysy11, 03/31/2007,Awesome,pos,"I picked up the car in Feb and after 1 month of driving I still absolutely love the car.  It drives very smooth, I have the dvd player and navi, and both are very user friendly.  I am constantly getting compliments on it and I would purchase this car again if i had to do it again! I used to drive a mercedes c240 2005, but this is much much better!"
acura,mdx,2007,Narsi, 04/18/2007,A really good decision,pos,"Bought the vehicle in February, nimbus grey with taupe interior. We were in the market for a SUV with a third row that doesn't feel heavy to drive and we have the near perfect combination in our X. We have put close to 3000 miles in it. Loving it so far. Being a tech geek, it has kept me grinning everytime I take it out of the driveway. Can't wait to take it out on a long trip. I have become a shameless show off after this purchase.  Our son loves the entertainment system, I love the ELS stereo though I still haven't figured out the speciality of DVD-A. My wife loves the navigation and everyone is happy. "
acura,mdx,2007,JohnnyT, 05/01/2007,Wow!!!,pos,"I can't believe I am saying this, but I love this vehicle! This coming from a man who wouldn't even consider an Acura product. My allegiance has always been with my Bavarian brothers but this time I wanted to be different, and besides the Wifey got the new X-5. Surprisingly enough my sled holds its own with the X-5 and its horsepower advantage. Especially using my Sports package's features gets me through the Malibu hills quite spiritedly. Enough oomph to pass on the freeways of LA and enough panache to park at your trendy diners around town. It just blends in rather than the opulent massive bohemoths like Caddies and Rovers crowding our beloved city. Overall, the SUV is a fine vehicle."
acura,mdx,2007,Fred, 03/28/2007,At 1000 mi,pos,"Review at 3 weeks and 1000 miles:  Overall, this vehicle is a home run, not even a stand up triple.  It has been challenged on mountain passes,with snow and dry pavement, the handling is like no SUV or car I have driven.  The control, especially in sport mode, removes almost all insecurity and white knuckles.  MPG: overall 21.6 at 1000 with a mix of 60% hwy and 40% city.  Snow performance 8/10. Marginal tread design of the Michelin all-seasons is the reason.  Light off road duty is very good.  Nav system is slightly superior to Toyota.  We have both.  A bit difficult to negotiate in a tight parking lot.  Flip side is plenty of room for kids and cargo."
acura,mdx,2007,nick@night, 04/01/2007,2007 Acura MDX Tech/Ent,pos,Car drives very nice and is quiet compared to other Honda vehicles using the same platform. Features (tech and entertainment pkg) are well thought-out and appeal to those who can appreciate new technology. I only have 1k miles on the clock so it's still too early to tell how the MDX will hold up. Michelin tires are very quiet and handle well. 
acura,mdx,2007,JWEISS, 04/08/2007,This is the best car I've ever owned,pos,"This is a full sport utility vehicle and a luxury car combined!!   It rides like (even better than) my Lexus ES 330 and it still does the job for skiing, surfing, and road trips!!  This car fits 6 adults in real comfort.  You could easily do 4 adults, 2 kids and a dog on a long road trip and nobody feels cramped.  This vehicle is awesome.  Took a 600 mile road trip and several coastal drives so far.  Do get the cooler to keep your beverages and food cold so you don't have to stop and buy food (helps offset the cost of the gasoline) .  I know it's not eco-conscious, but it is the most fun you can have for the money and still feel like a star pulling up to Spago."
acura,mdx,2007,consultauto, 04/19/2007,Great drivers SUV,pos,"Traded in our '06 honda Pilot for an '07 MDX, the difference between the two was obvious from the moment you drive off.  The MDX feels planted on the road with minimal roll, good acceleration.  I'm very pleased with my purchase and feel that it was a definitive upgrade from the Honda Pilot."
acura,mdx,2007,jighead55, 04/19/2007,FUN to own,pos,Bought my MDX a few weeks ago. S far I'm having a blast with it. The technology is awesome and driving is fun.
acura,mdx,2007,chennaivasi, 05/16/2007,Just love having it :-),pos,"What a fantastic one. This is our first SUV, and first luxury car.  So much difference to driving comfort compared to my earlier Camry. Just feels stuck to road, DVD is awesome, crazy voice commands and GPS is too good to be true, accurate.  Too bad I have just one so my wife drives it and I get it only on weekends... something I look forward to the whole week :-)"
acura,mdx,2007,Drew, 05/03/2007,What an SUV,pos,"Just purchased our 2007 MDX with tech package... what an amazing car.  This car has every feature you can think of.  The DVD surround stereo is amazing.  This car is actually fun to drive, and the handling is like no SUV I have ever driven (Dodge, Chevy, Toyota, BMW).  The  turning radius is amazing, take a corner and push the gas and just smile.  I have three kids ages 14, 12 and 9 and we have plenty of room.  The ease of use with the voice activation system for GPS, stereo, climate is second to none. Acura knows how to build a car!  "
acura,mdx,2007,kg, 05/15/2007,MDX,pos,"Just purchased and have not found many flaws with this vehicle at all.  Great features, fun to drive, plenty of space, and it looks great."
acura,mdx,2007,Dennis , 05/17/2007,All that and more,pos,Bought the sport with ent package in Feb and have already taken 2 trips over 300 miles.  Gotten 22 MPG ave about 70-75 on the hwy.  In town getting about 16-17.   The handling is a dream and plenty of power to spare.  Kids love the rear ent and we love being able to let the kids listen to their music while we listen to ours.  Kids also love being able to bring the game cube or ps2 and I just love being able to plug it in.  Best SUV for the money.
acura,mdx,2007,fly, 03/02/2008,Best in comfort and power,pos,This suv has everyting from heads up display to nav. I love the mdx. I have taken the mdx on long trips and found the comfort level is 2nd to none. My wife will not fly so all our trips are on the highway.  Highway miles per gallon 22-23 mpg @74mph  city 17-18 mpg  The only problem I find is the gas tank door sticks when cold.  
acura,mdx,2007,ToddB, 06/19/2007,Very Nice SUV,pos,"Recently traded in my Lexus RX 350 for the 2007 MDX.  Living in the mountains of Utah I need something comparable to a dog sled.  Also needed reliability.  Not as smooth as my Lexus, but plenty of power for the steep roads (manual comes in handy).  Love the styling. It's the most unique vehicle on the road - some may say unique = ugly!  Takes a while to learn the tech stuff.  19 MPG mixed driving, mostly city. Overall, very pleased. "
acura,mdx,2007,pete, 06/20/2007,Unbelievable,pos,"Just bought this vehicle and it is best I've ever owned. 'm getting 18.5 MPG. For 300 hp, no complaints there. I got the base and added roofrack, crossbars, sport rails and daynight mirror and still came in literally 15k less than BMW, 7k less than Lexus (RX 350). Great ride, great warranty, great afterownership services through Acura. Safest SUV on road, Make this your last test drive and you will buy it; no other automaker can justify the price difference."
acura,mdx,2007,rdhaddock, 06/26/2007,Great Road Car,pos,"I've put 27,000 miles on this car in less than 6 months and I love it. It gets 22 to 24 mpg on average with mostly road miles. Handling, acceleration, and everything is great. My only complaint would be that the seats are not as comfortable as I would like for such long road trips. "
acura,mdx,2007,Tom, 07/09/2007,Nice SUV,pos,"Compared with Lexus 350, BMW X5 3.0,  Better than the ones compared to. You can carry lots of people and/or stuff and have a whole lot of fun doing it!! This '07 MDX is truly as good as it gets!! "
acura,mdx,2007,HockeyFox, 07/25/2007,Acura Does It Right,pos,"After owning a Honda Pilot and an Acura CL type S, I am a Honda fan.  My confidence is being tested with tranny issues on the CL, but we absolutely loved our Pilot.  The MDX is a step up at every level.  The navigation system, initially appearing complex, is easy to use and very informative once you get the hang of it.  The build quality is very good with a few minor issues (one being a ding in the quarter panel when we went to pick up the car).  Power is just fine for a vehicle this size, and the interior is wonderful.  If we experience the same reliability as we did on our 2003 Pilot, we will be very happy campers."
acura,mdx,2007,ssundy, 07/27/2007,"Wow, what a ride!",pos,"I've had my MDX for about 4 months now and it's a fabulous vehicle all the way around. Fantastic styling, very fun to drive and pretty good on gas mileage for it's power and size. All my family and friends want one now lol!"
acura,mdx,2007,Facha, 07/31/2007,"Perfect harmony of luxury, tech, and sport",pos,"I bought this SUV early July, and am loving every bit of the vehicle. My family members including myself are owners of 5 Lexus vehicles (2 ES, 2 GS, 1 SC) and I introduced the '07 MDX to the bunch. I have no complaints so far and I love the luxury feel of the inside with an awesome sport feel that I would not be able to get from the RX. I test drove several SUVs (Audi Q7, RX 350, BMW X5, Buick Enclave, Chevy Tahoe, looked at the LR3, GMC Acadia) and nothing came close to the drive and luxury that MDX offered. Navigation and voice commands for nav, climate and radio are by far the best."
acura,mdx,2007,Jake and Katie, 07/29/2007,Great family car,pos,"We absolutely love this vehicle.  It fits both of our kids (with car seats), our dog, and several adults comfortably.  The memory seats are great, being that my husband and I have almost a foot difference in height.  Does not drive quite as well as our Saab 9-3, but definitely more like a sedan than expected.  Also like that insurance barely increased (and prior vehicle was 99 Passat)."
acura,mdx,2007,try2follow, 09/09/2007,What a powerful beauty,pos,"I was driving a 2005 MDX and was offered a company car. The choice included BMW X5, Mercedes ML350, Audi Q7 and Lexus RX 350. Given my excellent experience with Acura for the last 2 years I opted for the new MDX. Acura did a great job (interior and exterior).  I love the new sporty look. The seats are very comfortable and provide good support. The 300 hp engine does a great job, sound and performance are impressive. I prefer the new navigation system over the old one. The 10-speaker sound system beats my stereo at home! My children love the larger DVD screen (9 inch now). The blind spots are a problem but once you know you are just extra careful when changing lanes."
acura,mdx,2007,Ryan, 10/06/2007,Road Tripper,pos,"We bought our MDX in May 2007 and immediately took it on a 4 month, 12,500+ mile road trip through the USA and Canada. Mountains, deserts, bad roads and good - we really put this car through its paces and have been very satisfied. The MDX drives like a car on twisty roads even without the sport suspension and the manumatic was very useful in the mountains. Interior space is excellent - we traveled with a baby & all associated gear. The nav system is accurate and easy to use. Highway gas mileage is better than rated (about 25 mpg), but city is worse (about 17). Only mechanical prob is a ""clicking"" noise when steering at low speed - dealer says they have a fix - have to see."
acura,mdx,2007,BIgd..., 10/04/2007,Very Happy Wife,pos,"So far just getting used to all the gadgets has been a challenge. I really like the feature when you unlock it but forget something and have to go back. You can program it to lock in 30, 60 or 90 seconds after you may have inadvertently unlocked it and forgot. Great security feature. I have taken it on a few long trips and am also very happy with the cruise control especially on steep hill climbs like I have in BC,Canada. I have set it at 80 MPH and climbed a 12%-18% hill grade and maintained it for the 2km hill climb. Awesome!! I actually like the navi control knob that some people seem to hate.   "
acura,mdx,2007,louieo, 05/18/2007,Super MDX for '07,pos,"Traded in '04 MDX for this year's upgrade and both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this new vehicle.  Somewhat disappointed in the rear view mirror, low quality for the type of vehicle. Great 18"" Michelin tires and the superb stereo system is a joy to listen to.  Roomy and very comfortable. Just a joy to drive!"
acura,mdx,2007,adam, 05/20/2007,I'd Rather Have a BMW,neu,"Good car, handles nicely, I expected a little more kick. The car has the technology I need but it may be a little too technologically advanced. My only complaint is that it is the ugliest car on the road."
acura,mdx,2007,Tony, 06/14/2007,"After 5,000 miles still best SUV for $$",pos,"I had written a previous post about the MDX but wanted to reserve judgement until I had more miles on it.  We just passed the 5,000 mile mark and the MDX is still the best SUV on the market today IMHO.  MPG=20.3, great reliability, comfortable and stylish interior.  Plenty of room for kids.  A lot of fun for road trips.   I have heard people say that the car is too advanced, and I don't really understand that as a negative.  The car is very intuitive.  I am no computer geek but I have had no problems learning the tech features.  If you pay this much for a vehicle, I want all these features!!  Get a lot of positive comments about the car.  Really breaks the mold!!"
acura,mdx,2007,annlee, 06/21/2007,Sweet Ride!!,pos,Exceeds every SUV I compared to. It either has it better or less expensive. This car has every feature you can think of. The DVD surround stereo is amazing (front and rear can be operated separately by driver). I am having so much fun driving it. My husband is always trying to find a reason to drive it. We traded a '99 Landcruiser and the insurance only increased $100 over the 6mos... WOW!! This car has excellent safety ratings along with an alarm system that cuts off the fuel supply.  
acura,mdx,2007,Don, 06/25/2007,One-Month Review,pos,"Like the styling and comfort, but there are things that I missed completely with the test drive. 1) The bottom of the steering wheel feels like a food grater as the sharp and hard stitching sits above the leather, 2) the navigation system is at least 2-3 years behind in features with only 2D maps and ugly text for street names, 3) the AUX input requires an iPod at full volume, 4) the voice recognition is worthless and unusable, it's wrong at least 75% of the time, 5) when you drive in an ""unverified"" area (my home of 50 years) there are annoying warnings that don't go away without a lot of attention, and the worst, 6) the steering is so hard my wrists hurt when trying to turn a corner."
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 08/02/2007,Exceeds my expectations every day,pos,"The 2007 MDX a superb vehicle. It's truly hard to express how great this vehicle is. The navigation system is intuitive and simple to use. The voice recognition is excellent. The ride is extremely comfortable and the vehicle handles the road extremely well. I can't imagine how well the Sports Package performs. Overall, easily the best vehicle I've owned (compared to Explorer, Jeep, BMW). Highly recommended. "
acura,mdx,2007,Srid, 07/31/2007,All in one Champ,pos,"Undoubtedly this is the best of its class vehicle with outstanding bang for the buck.   I am into 3rd week of ownership, so my experience with it is minimal, but all for now I can observe and suggest that Acura improve the ride with more comfort or sportier.  Either be more like comfy Lexus or sportier like BMW.  Regardless, my experience is still minimal and as it stands I own an outstanding car."
acura,mdx,2007,Davispandk, 09/14/2007,"Awesome car, some suggested improvements",pos,"First the positive - this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. It is an awesome vehicle for sure. The technology is like a science fiction movie, at least for someone like me who has never owned a luxury car before. Everything is easy to use if you take the time to read the manual and practice. There are so many minor details that Acura does right to make this car so much more than just a car. I do have some complaints, though, and they mostly relate to practicality: 3rd row legroom could be better based on experience in similar size cars; 2nd row seat buckles are poorly spaced for booster seats; 2nd row climate control vents do not adequately reach the 3rd row."
acura,mdx,2007,jadladrad, 10/11/2007,traded for a Audi Q7,neg,First and probably my last Acura. Big Honda fan so had high expectations that were not met. I liked the styling and it was fun to drive but overall the build quality and use of cheap materials got tiresome.
acura,mdx,2007,Baymate Diego, 10/12/2007,Great family SUV can be improved,pos,We bought a 2007 Acura MDX tech package more than a month ago. Great handling. Overall excellent interior and exterior. Both navigation and backup camera are great additions. Vehicle is wilder than comparable vehicles so think about parking in crowded garages before purchase. We bought this over competitions because of excellent value and the 7 seat capacity. Third row seats practical only for kids. There is sometimes wind noise coming from the right side when driving on freeway. Have not figured that one out yet.
acura,mdx,2007,George, 05/27/2007,Now I have TWO MDXs,pos,"I purchased an MDX Tech with the Entertainment pack for my wife last year when it debuted.  I love it. I was driving it so often that my wife said get your own and I did 4 days ago!  I looked at the mercedes g450 but $70,000 with the options was $20,000 more than mine.  I test drove Audi G7, Lexus GX470, Volvo x90, BMW X5, Cadillac Escalade and SR ALL more expensive cannot compare to the MDX.  I purchased the Sport/entertainment Black.  Quality and reliability 10, it drives like a dream.  Great passing acceleration.  Best Nav I have seen.  The drive is smooth and comfortable. Bluetooth works well with my Verizon Treo700."
acura,mdx,2007,Paul, 06/01/2007,What a nice car,pos,I love this car. Driving is so fun with powerful engine and active damper control. I don't regret any penny I spent on this car. Well designed amenities are very user friendly. Improved voice recognition functions are so useful in inserting address on the navigation system. 
acura,mdx,2007,Malyel, 06/27/2007,An SUV for Driving Enthusiasts,pos,"After 3,000 miles I am in love with my MDX Sport. The MDX handles like a sports car. The brakes are amazing. It stops on a dime. Gas mileage is better than expected (17c/21h). Best of all, the MDX moves! The MDX has more features than any other SUV in its class. The MDX won out in our comparison with the GL450, X5, GX470 and Q7. The MDX actually drives like a sports sedan and not an SUV. The same can't be said about the other SUVs we tested."
acura,mdx,2007,Ryan, 06/30/2007,"Great car, even better sound system",pos,"I've owned my MDX since October 06, have about 8,000 on her.  Really a top notch SUV.  Ride and handling are smooth and accurate.  The interior design of the car is absolutely stunning.  Seats are very comfortable and although some controls not in the most convenient of places, where else would you put them?  There are a lot of features in this car.  The navigation and voice recognition are excellent as is the handsfree phone operation.  The most impressive feature is by far the DVD audio stereo system.  The sound that comes out of this thing is beyond description, especially if you have a DVD audio disk.  Overall, clearly one of the best SUVs out there today.    "
acura,mdx,2007,lola9, 07/15/2007,"Great, fun, quality car",pos,"After 15 years of loyal Lexus ownership, I decided to give Acura a try - so far, this seems to be a very wise decision.  MDX is a fun drive, fast, sporty, comfortable, and family friendly.  "
acura,mdx,2007,ken68, 07/27/2007,Great Ride,pos,"For an SUV I love the way this truck performs, rides and drives.  I traded my 2005 TL, which was riddled with fit and finish issues, for the MDX and am very glad I did."
acura,mdx,2007,inguinal hernia, 08/03/2007,Satisfied in Chicago,pos,"I've owned a new 07 MDX for a month now, and have driven it close to 2000 miles in city and suburb.  Comparing it to my past ownership of a Honda Accord and my spouse's BMW 5 series sedan, I think this is an excellent AWD SUV and I would, with no doubt, buy it again.  The audio system quality and navi. are noticeably superior to the bmw's.  Easy to drive around family and friends in comfort.  Easy to haul luggage and purchases from the local hardware store.  Rear view camera is indispensable (IMHO, this should be standard on all SUVs for safety).  Minor quibbles:  ""live"" traffic update is not so helpful, I prefer pushing buttons or twisting dials for commands rather than voice."
acura,mdx,2007,jaystuff, 08/18/2007,Headrest issue,pos,"About 4000 miles now. Never has been to Acura for a single problem. For the money, you get a lot of stuff. Voice recognition is for the birds. Main problem that I didn't notice during my test drive: if you keep the seat erect, at a good angle for your posture, the head rest pushes your neck down !!! Most uncomfortable headrest in the industry. Acura claims that it is a safety feature, but it only works if you angle the seat back about 15 degrees!!! Mileage is okay for a heavy SUV. Get the sport package - handling is out-of-sight."
acura,mdx,2007,MDX02Then07, 09/03/2007,Finally traded old MDX and love new one!,pos,"I finally traded in my '02 MDX after nearly 6 years of hauling countless kids.  I was reluctant to let it go, because it was a great car.  When I first drove the new '07 model it seemed too big and I didn't like the grille.  I am so happy with that I let that go  The ride is fantastic, it's easy to park around the city, the back up camera, bluetooth, and navigation are fantastic.  The power lift gate is a great convenience.  The driver seat is so comfortable.  My kids are in heaven with the rear entertainment system, and I can still listen to my sounds up front.  How great is that?"
acura,mdx,2007,shl1108, 09/08/2007,Love my Car!,pos,"I love this car. I drive considerably on the freeways and side streets for my job every day. I wanted navigation, 3rd row for the kids, midsize luxury SUV. The style is great, so fun to drive and it is the perfect size for my family (3 kids). When I say fun to drive, I really mean I love to drive this car. To soccer games/practices, choir practices, school and preschool drop and pick up. It makes the necessary work and family driving less painful and that is exactly what I was looking for in this car. The upside: smooth pick up (especially at 50 mph+, like a galloping horse), real time traffic on the navi has saved me plenty of time already. My kids love the heated rear seats and DVD."
acura,mdx,2007,JC, 10/18/2007,Excellent choice,pos,"I love this car! It feels secure & solid; the handling is smooth & the acceleration is strong. The leather seats are comfortable & the sound system is fantastic; great sound quality & easy to use. The nav system has proven to be a real asset. The rearview camera takes a couple of seconds to come on, but gives a good view of whats directly behind the car. The climate control system has been flawless. The power tailgate opens slowly, but works great. I haven't used the bluetooth. The headlights work great too, giving a wide area of coverage. Don't know about other drivers, but I love them! Blind spot on the right rear side, but comfortable w/it now. MPG is decent; 20/22 combined driving. "
acura,mdx,2007,Scott McCandless, 10/24/2007,11 month review,pos,"I came out of an Expedition to buy this SUV and was pleasantly surprised by how much more comfortable the vehicle is than a truck based SUV.  The horsepower and performance are up from my previous truck/SUV vehicles, and so is the mileage.  Those giving the MDX poor grades for mileage are not comparing it to other SUV choices.  I regularly get 22-23 mpg at 70-75 mph on the highway. I chose this SUV for a couple specific reasons: I needed a vehicle that could tow my 23' boat and its trailer, but I wanted a comfortable, economical everyday ride, too.  The BMW and Lexus didn't have the tow power, or enough room. The truck based SUV choices didn't have ride & economy."
acura,mdx,2007,nvdesertrat, 10/25/2007,Second MDX,pos,"I tested the BMW X5 3.0 (too small, slow), the X5 4.8 (fast, too expensive!), the Lexus RX (nice, not sporty enough). This vehicle is a big step up from the '02 model: more power, better handling (doesn't feel a bit like a mini-van anymore), more creature comforts and roughly the same fuel economy. Driver's seat is very comfortable for my 5'-11"" frame.  The SH-AWD system is terrific as you feel it pull you around sharp turns as you accelerate. Nav. syst. has good display and gives clear and adjustable directions (from almost constant advice to concise directions). Hands Free Link hooks up to B/tooth c-phone on startup, sound system automatically switches to phone when called."
acura,mdx,2007,Dave R, 11/03/2007,Very happy with purchase,pos,"I love the comfortable ride and performance. The 10 way power driver's seat combined with the telescoping steering wheel makes it easy to find a comfortable position.  My wife and I both drive the vehicle so the custom seat, mirror, radio, and phone book settings linked to each key are great. The exterior styling is a real head turner, much better than the 2006 models. Visibility from the cockpit at night is great.  Love the interior styling and dash appearance. Third row seating comes in handy on occasion. The navigation system is easy to use and convenient. Practically every feature comes standard. Back-up camera is a nice plus. "
acura,mdx,2007,un, 11/16/2007,The vehicle that has it all,pos,"Very powerful for its size and drives like a car with the SH-AWD making it feel like one, on the most demanding curves. Brakes are stellar with the brake assist feature and with the stability assist control thrown in, your driving is completely technology assisted. We currently get about 18/23 city/hwy on premium gas. Interior is quite comfortable except for the third row which is best for kids under 4'. Navigation/sound system/backup camera/heated seats and dvd make it a nice long trip vehicle. The center console is a huge bin without any coin holders/small compartments. Road noise is prevalant at times. Tire noise is minimal. Lots of techno gizmos to keep you busy for a while."
acura,mdx,2007,Larry, 11/21/2007,"6 months 10,000 miles and still love it!",pos,"Bought my MDX in June '07 after testing all comparable w/3rd row seats (X5, Q7, GX 470). For the value, it won hands down. For the same items and options in others would have cost an additional 10-20K.  Have 10K miles of city/highway driving, and love every minute of driving it! It's more like a sport sedan than SUV. Ride and acceleration are excellent; seating comfort great in front & back seats. Yes, 3rd row is for kids and small adults, but if you want a full-time 3rd row, get a full-size SUV. They work great when heading out with a few extra friends. No question this is a great combination of value, fun, and luxury in SUV skin. Wife has TL-S - loves driving the X!"
acura,mdx,2007,Dan McMahon, 11/26/2007,Second and last MDX,neu,"Nothing but problems with all of the new electronics. Nav works when it wants to and always when it is at the dealer. Air bags misfunction... messages pop up dealer tells me to just ignore it. Rear camera works MOST of the time. Entertainment system not working for 5 months. Dealer wants to fix it but doesn't have a clue. I guess service personel will eventually be trained on the new model. I owned and still have a 2005, I didn't test drive before purchasing... what a mistake!"
acura,mdx,2007,jrt, 11/27/2007,Excellent Upgrade,pos,"I upgraded from an original 2001 MDX to this one and am very impressed by the quality and features they've added to the car.  Makes my old one feel very bare bones.   We did a 1,400 mile road trip over Thanksgiving with the new MDX and loved every moment.  Powerful engine, feels wide and stable on the road, tracks well through corners, good sight lines.  Very nice. The seats are very comfortable. The front seating areas are a little confining by design. Navi and entertainment systems are both very well done. Cargo space could be a little larger but larger space = larger body = more weight = fewer MPG.  So it's not a bad balance as is.  Overall I'm very pleased with this SUV."
acura,mdx,2007,Hondafan, 05/01/2008,Best Honda Ever,pos,"I've owned over a dozen Hondas and Acuras through the years. I must confess this is probably the best vehicle Honda has ever made, right up there with such ground breakers as the NSX and s2000. Honda has simply built an SUV version of the Acura RL. I should know since I also have an RL. In all but the most aggressive of handling maneuvers the MDX matches the RL. It's very quiet with a nice engine growl when revved. Acceleration is good for such a heavy vehicle. Rear comfort for 2 is excellent. The other 3 spots are for children. Cargo space is ample with the rear seat stowed, towing performance is excellent. Competitors may be better in one category or another, but overall none is even clo"
acura,mdx,2007,CCS414, 11/11/2020,2007 MDX W/Tech Package,neu,"Bought used with around 110k miles on it. I was hoping for Honda reliability in a luxury package. That was not the case!! AC compressor went out shortly after purchase (around 115k) and ruined the entire system. $1700 fix. The AC replacement I can live with but the electrical drain/gremlin was infuriating. No mechanic could figure it out. I tried youtube and apparently electrical drains are common on this vehicle. We tried everything but it still would not start after sitting for only 3 or 4 days. Also, CD player kept making a weird clicking noise when the car was turn off. We finally just had to get rid of it.

The major upside of this SUV is the power and handling. It really does feel like a luxury touring sedan in an SUV packages. If you're willing to live with the headaches then this might be a good vehicle for you but if you want something trouble free then look elsewhere.

acura,mdx,2008,Brake Problems, 10/03/2008,Brake Rotor Problems,neu,"My MDX is mostly a pleasant SUV to drive and own. However, I was surprised when I had problems with the brake rotors at a low mileage and Acura told me that I ""brake too hard"" and I would ""burn"" the rotors because of my driving style. Well, I am a rather slow driver and 70 % of my driving is highway driving. I have had 4 Toyota SUVs prior to this one and never had a brake issue. Could there be a quality issue with the rotors on the 2008 MDX? Compared with my previous Toyotas I feel the MDX seats too hard and uncomfortable on longer rides."
acura,mdx,2008,marko221, 03/02/2011,SH-AWD Will Make Everything Better,pos,"During the recent snowstorm we received at Lake Tahoe, our MDX simply blew past everyone installing chains and kept up with the 4x4 rigs with the huge mud/snow tires and lift kits. Even on icy surfaces, we held our traction. The OEM Bridgestones have 5/32"" tread left but the power distribution to the fronts, rears, or left or right was incredible! It can be monitored on the computer within the dash.
My confidence kept building during our 3-hour commute up the mountain.
A hazard warning blipped on and off when I intentionally tried to ""drift"" the vehicle on an icy patch at the gas station.
Note to all: the commercials regarding the SH-AWD are fact!"
acura,mdx,2008,raindude, 01/02/2012,Back to lexus,neu,"So i bought my mdx with 80k miles on it dec 2009.
The technology, room, power, etc were great.
I thought that this was finally e vehicle that i could run to 300k.
Not. Turns out the torque converter was going bad at 95k miles.
The dealership said that these things happen.
I brought car to a local transmission place for a better price. They said their are many many problems with the mdx and pilot transmissions.
They recommended a full trans rebuild since it would need one eventually anyhow.
Not sure why acura and honda havent corrected this but the problem has been going on for 10 years.
Bye bye acura.
Bought my lexus instead...."
acura,mdx,2008,acura08, 08/18/2010,2008 MDX tech,pos,Everything was great. Until I hit 60k miles (warranty expires) the wiper sensors and engine oil sensors got messed up. The wipers turn on and off by themselves and also the engine oil sensor. It was awesome how the engine oil sensor bugged out and I was on the highway during rush hour. The last row seats are a nice add but not for long trips. Honda/Acura is notorious for their window problem on the driver side. Driving the MDX is fun the handling is awesome I can whip turns better then a lot of sedans. Even the Lexus cant beat it not sure about the X5.
acura,mdx,2008,Chrissy, 08/28/2010,60K and still loving it!,pos,"3 years and 60 k and I still love this car.  It has been the most reliable car I've owned.  Before my MDX I was averaging a new car every year.  Two Infiniti SUVs and one Escalade later I bought this.  I LOVE IT!  It has all the luxuries for a fair price with a beautiful fit and finish.  It's definitely a keeper!  It's comfortable, fun, safe, and easy to drive.   I put a lot of miles on my cars and this one has been the best of them all.  No problems whatsoever.  Before buying my MDX I test drove every Luxury SUV on the market.  This one was the best driving, one of the best interiors, great technology, and most affordable of them all."
acura,mdx,2008,babake, 05/04/2010,Poor Acura Quality,neg,"Been having problems with our MDX since the day we bought it. After 5 attempts, the windows still squeak, the wheels vibrate, the radio loses its memory, the seats power setting has problems. Amazing that consumer report keeps on reporting Acura MDX as a top SUV pick. We moved to the Acura from a lexus RX to get a little more sporty feel and have been regretting our decision since. The dealer service people are also very confrontational - do not recommend Hopkins Acura of Redwood City CA. We are going to go trade our MDX for a Lexus."
acura,mdx,2008,chcaviar, 05/28/2018,Can't beat it,pos,"This is our 2nd MDX.  Poor mileage is because it has been mostly city driving.  Absolutely no real problems with the car.  Buying the new 2019 RDX.
"
acura,mdx,2008,G, 06/01/2008,A fun SUV with a few bugs,neu,"Bought this car after comparing with the Q7 and X3.  Very happy with the engine and chassis, not so with transmission.  Fav part is the electronic damping control - when it works.  The system went down a few times with scary warning sign on gauge - and car rides like a boat when EDC is down.  Dealership tried but was not able to fix it properly.  Will try again."
acura,mdx,2008,longtime honda owner, 01/27/2010,Great sporty SUV,pos,"I bought this to replace my 1998 5.9L Durango. The MDX tows my 4500lb boat + trailer better than the big Dodge! Yes, I was surprised as well. :-) We drive this over a 4100ft mountain pass to our cabin roughly 25 times a year. It's safe and stable in any condition. Nearing 30k miles with no faults and I like the vehicle as much now as when I drove it off the lot. There's plenty of room for my family of 4, lab and all our gear. A rooftop box makes I've added lets me take all the stuff I should have left at home to begin with. Seriously, if you are looking for a reliable, sporty SUV you can't go wrong with an MDX."
acura,mdx,2008,the man, 10/21/2007,A great car,pos,This car is so smooth. I also have a pilot and this car rides and handles much better. Has a real luxury feel to it.
acura,mdx,2008,Skillet, 05/12/2008,My $40k Gas Hog,pos,"I've had this car for almost a year now so some of the emotional thrill of the purchase has worn off. I really like the car in general. It performs well, nice acceleration, handles well and it looks good.  My biggest issue is gas performance. I'm getting 13 mpg in the city. It's not much better than an H1 or a Winnebago. I didn't buy the car for it's fuel economy but this is far below what I expected. I should get more than 250 miles out of tank of gas."
acura,mdx,2008,rfcn2, 12/01/2012,Best Handling SUV I Have Ever Driven,pos,"We bought this car the first day of 2008.
We owned at that time a 2003 MDX that we sold privately to the first person that came to see it.
We now have 45,000 miles on the 2008 MDX.


We drove most of the better SUVs that were available in 2008.
IMHO this was the best one regardless of price.
The only other one that drove about as well as the MDX and felt luxurious was the Buick Enclave.
My wife mostly wanted a 3 row vehicle so Lexus was not really considered.
The other finalist was the smaller Caddy.


To me the MDX is a great handling SUV.
It is really fun to drive.
Not a Vette, but for a big car this is the cat's meow.
Repairs have been needed but better than average."
acura,mdx,2008,mac, 09/06/2010,Rear end thump/squeak noise,pos,I love the handling of this SUV. I had my rear end noise fixed as per TSB 09-002. Problem came back after few months went to the dealer to fixed it again. I hope the parts replaced the second time will last.
acura,mdx,2008,De, 07/28/2009,Great car,pos,"I researched this car for over a year.  My work paid off. The dealership is great and the automobile is fantastic.  The only negative is I feel the paint is a little thin.  It nicks very easily.  I love the drive, the reliability, and handling. Is it fun to drive???  Really, it is an SUV not a Porsche! "
acura,mdx,2008,houston, 07/14/2008,Don't Buy It!,neg,"I purchased this car in March. I previously owned a Honda with well over 100,000 miles and loved it. So you think you are getting high quality for the money? Wrong! I have had problems since the beginning. There was extreme wind noise which they attributed to a bent windshield. The car started making clicking and grinding noises. That was the defective bushings. I have driven it exactly 16 days and the bushings have evidently gone bad again (bulletin on these). The entire dash is squeaking and they said they will have to tear out the dash to figure it out. There is some metal fluttering and continued noise like the door is open also. Buy anything else on the market and you will be happier."
acura,mdx,2008,Mary Ann, 09/02/2018,I would buy the Acura MDX again!,pos,"The car does require premium gas, but that's absolutely the only thing I don't like about it, even after 10 years.  Very minimal repairs and still looks stylish.  I love it!
UPDATE:   And now after almost 12 years, I still love it and don't want to get rid of it!  If I had to buy a new car tomorrow, it would be another Acura - maybe an RDX because I don't really need the space anymore, but definitely an Acura SUV!  LOVE IT!

Nightmare begins. 3/17- A/C blows hot - dealer replaces incorrectly installed refrigerant line; steering wheel shimmys during braking - dealer turns rotors; radio won't hold presets -  dealer reprograms key fobs 4/7- steering wheel still shimmys under braking - dealer replaces rotors and pads; radio still not working - dealer states ""it works now"" 4/15 - radio presets disappear again - dealer replaces radio tuner 5/22 -  radio still won't hold presets; Acura regional rep states ""there's no remedy""; problem is under investigation by Acura engineering; 6/4 - Acura customer svc rep states they know about the problem but there's no known date when problem will be resolved"
acura,mdx,2008,charles, 11/06/2008,Touch choice,pos,"This is a good car. Good power, great ride, it has a sporty suspension that can take jumping a curb or ramming through uneven pavement going 60 mph. So that's a plus.  The interior is nice, good heated seats useful, excellent rear view camera.  One problem: the gear shift, wiper controls and light controls are less than easy to use.  First the wiper and light controls should be lit at night: they are not.  The biggest issue I have with them is that they lack the European feedback that BMW offers, i.e., I like to not have to look down to see what gear I'm in, what level wiper I am on, or what light is on.  If it would work by just feel alone, Acura would do well."
acura,mdx,2008,Owen, 09/16/2016,Great car,pos,"Only con is that it's a gas guzzler.  Otherwise I love this car
"
acura,mdx,2008,David Johnson, 07/14/2016,Good choice for a used vehicle,pos,"This car has a lot of nice features that are not normally considered when looking for a new vehicle:  handle grips for getting in and out, sunglasses holder above the mirror, hidden storage area inside the shifter console.  I bought mine used, have had it for four years, and am  very pleased with its comfort and performance.  Dealership maintenance can be expensive but a good local shop can keep it running at an affordable cost.  Head turning quotient is excellent.

acura,mdx,2008,update after 9 month, 05/29/2009,Update after 9 months,neg,"MDX performs well and is a safe vehicle if you can start the vehicle!  I have had mine in the shop for 20 days and Acura customer service is horrible!  I have asked to speak to managers (who were worthless), called client services, and even wrote a letter to headquarters with no resolution.  The Acura dealership gives me the run around with what exactly is wrong with the vehicle.  First it was the battery (and tried blaming me for leaving lights on when they turn off themselves!), then the entertainment system, and now it's the power tail gate!  Don't spend good money on a company that doesn't care about satisfying a customer once the sale is made!"
acura,mdx,2008,wj, 06/25/2008,Shamefull quality of Acura,neg,"Bought the ""best"" end of MDX and end up with worst nightmare. The quality of the car is a shame. Been back to the dealer 9 or 10 times for repairs and repairs. Defective mirror, roof molding, gas door assembly, steering wheel, front suspension defects. Customer services are horrible both with the dealer and especially the Acura reps. Their attitudes are that you bought the car and you have the problem. Gas mileage is terrible, remember that with current gas price."
acura,mdx,2008,Disappointed, 06/22/2008,Should've bought the CX-9,pos,"Was shopping for a replacement vehicle for my Honda Pilot late last year and was looking at the Mazda Cx-9, Toyota Highlander and the Acura MDX. Narrowed it down between the Cx-9 and the MDX and chose the MDX based upon the Acura reliability history.  Now looking back I wish I would have selected the CX-9 as my MDX has numerous issues that should not accompany an Acura.  My radio randomly resets all the preset settings.  No one can understand anyone in the car using the Bluetooth.  When the moonroof is open you cannot read anything displayed on the radio. Rattle coming from back cargo area, etc. At this pricepoint, you get much more with the Cx-9."
acura,mdx,2008,John Vaughn, 07/06/2008,Horrid Reliability,neg,"Just too many issues to list here.  The main ones are the suspension defects for both front and rear of vehicle.  The front lower control arms busted twice on mine just from every day normal city/high-way driving - no offroad use at all! No aggressive driving either.  The rear suspension sounds as something is going to break off - Also ""repaired"" twice... so they say. Problems still exist.  This vehicle has a lot of problems and Acura refuses to work with the customer."
acura,mdx,2008,Bill, 01/07/2009,Not worth the money,neu,"Problems galore - AWD problems 2 times - Wouldn't start due to AWD problems - replaced DVD player 3 times - side dash panels replaced 2 times - seats losing color after 20k miles - replaced batter after 12k miles - front rotors warped after 10k miles.  I was a lover of Acura, they have really changed in quality for the price."
acura,mdx,2008,of, 07/15/2008,Great SUV,pos,"Bought this vehicle after extensive research.  After narrowing down to X5, MDX and Highlander Hybrid, MDX was the clear winner.  Owned CL and TL-Type S and liked the included standard features as compared to other luxury vehicles.  Main complaint is the required premium gas and gas mileage.  I also have had the thump, thump after starting and accelerating to 20 MPH.  Took to the dealer and they identified it as a ""bushing issue"" which there was a service bulletin for.  They made the repair, but still have the thump.  Will have that checked out again at next oil change. Overall, very comfortable and great handling."
acura,mdx,2008,oscarkat3, 10/22/2008,Update after 10 months,pos,I still love driving this vehicle but the quality is a bit of a let down.  There are a few rattles including a loud one from the passenger seat.  The radio settings malfunction sporadically. The A/C makes whistling noises that sound like brakes squealing.  The dealer finally acknowledged some of the problems but they never adequately addressed all the problems either.  These are minor problems but a disappointment because I had a higher expectation of reliability.  I still love all the positives about the MDX.  I plan on keeping it for a while but I don't know if I will buy an Acura again?
acura,mdx,2008,Wanna be luxury, 10/01/2007,Luxury?,neg,"This vechicle is adequate and has a smooth ride. However, the interior has too much plastic and is uncomfortable for a ""luxury"" SUV.  I feel I was pressured into buying the MDX and would caution others to look at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus before buying.  Even the Murano is competition and is 12k cheaper!  I feel like ripping out the corning looking dash.  The voice recognition is distracting and Acura should scrap it.  The steering wheel grip reminds me of my father's 1966 Chevy.  It is way too thin.  Also, the seats are way too firm.  I have to send them out for foam to be added.  The DVD player cost is a ripoff but it's the only way to get the automatic tailgate."
acura,mdx,2008,PBenjung, 09/23/2007,Great Handling Plus Super Navigation System,pos,"Bought last week and am enjoying the ride.  Excellent acceleration, transmission shifts very smoothly, handles great around corners.  Interior fit and finish is good.  Still figuring out nav system but its mostly intuitive and a great asset.  "
acura,mdx,2008,Randall Hazzard, 11/12/2007,Mildly Disappointed,neu,"Performance and fun to drive. Love to hear it rev. My gas mileage is poor at 16.2 MPG. That is a mix of 60% highway and 40% city. Reliability and quality is less then expected. Slow leak in tire that dealer wanted to charge me $380.00 dollars to replace because they cant find the link but acknowledge the leak is there.  Needed to jump start 3 times. Twice because little dome light was left on by kids. Once because of a draw off battery that has been difficult to trace.  Mirrors don't adjust with change of driver in preprogram settings. Dealer says this is normal but if you can change my XM stations with different drivers, you can certainly adjust mirrors."
acura,mdx,2008,pdx family, 11/14/2007,Exceeds Expectations,pos,"We have had the 2008 Acura MDX for a month now and couldn't be more delighted.  It is replacing a Chrysler T&C.  My ratings are based on what my expectations are in this class of vehicle.  The size is perfect for us, it seats 5 easily and the +2 rear seating is quite acceptable though the access is difficult.  The ride is comfortable, firm and responsive. Sport upgrade is worth it. The navigation system is outstanding and can be operated while moving.  You must read the manuals to understand all the features. The gas mileage we have gotten is significantly better than EPA ratings. We got 25 mpg on a 200 mile x-mountain trip and see about 19 mpg in mixed town driving. "
acura,mdx,2008,josephd05, 05/21/2008,Great CUV overall,pos,"I am 6'4"" and find the seating comfort to be superb.  The Sport suspension is fantastic.  In comfort mode, it soaks up all the bumps.  In Sport mode, I feel like I'm driving a sports sedan.  This is a fantastic vehicle, but not without faults. 1. AM radio sounds terrible, very muffled. 2. Telescopic steering wheel should extend out a couple of more inches. 3. Bluetooth is okay, but does not automatically activate if I make the call from my blackberry.  You have to make the call from the car itself, very annoying. Thats about it.  Overall I am very pleased."
acura,mdx,2008,JP, 05/27/2008,Super Handling AWD,pos,"One of the best handling vehicles I've ever owned.  Feels much more like a sedan than an SUV (once it gets rolling).  Averaging about 20 MPG, feels like less since the tank is relatively small.   Stereo is very good. Oil changes are expensive since it requires synthetic oil. "
acura,mdx,2008,C Turner, 08/26/2018,Best car ever!,pos,This was the best car I’ve ever owned.  The reliability and comfort were outstanding.
acura,mdx,2008,pink panther, 07/30/2008,Not a luxury SUV,neg,"Even after a few days there were problems with this SUV.  Nothing really big but things detaching, safety belt  not working (twice).  This SUV is characterized by poor quality built and an overall blunt drive.  The cargo space is quite big and the third row sat functional for kids.  Burt for the price tag you should get better drive quality and certainly better build quality. The bluetooth function is very poor and does not synchronize with most phones.  The dvd system does have some problems too.  Poor fuel economy.  Acura compares itself to BMW but they have a long, long way to go"
acura,mdx,2008,namdxowner, 09/09/2008,Excellent Value for the money,pos,"The 2008 MDX is a great luxury family SUV. The MDX rides like a car and makes my wife feel safe on the road.  The last row seat is only useful for kids under 10. However, two features should have been standard with this car."
acura,mdx,2008,I'm Dissappointed, 10/19/2010,Acura doesn't stand by product,neu,"Nice driver, poor quality.  When I hit around 30,000 miles I noticed my lower paint chipping badly and starting to get rust on bottom of my mdx.  Went to my acura dealer to see if they would remedy the problem.  They will not stand by their design or workmanship.  On new mdx's they added a plastic strip and plastic flare guard on door. So they know the design was bad but will not fix the problem.  My 2nd mdx, also have an rdx, will never buy another Honda product.  There are many other nice suv's out there."
acura,mdx,2008,gamerchick, 06/14/2010,Won't buy it again,pos,"After almost 3 months of owning it, I got a leak from the edge of sunglasses holder. I brought it over to the dealer ship, they didn't find anything wrong with it. Soon after, My memory seats are not working at all. It takes lots of pushes to get the seat moved to the right position. I brought it to the dealership again. when they tested it, the button worked fine. so they said they couldn't do anything till it acted up. And of course after I got home, the memory seat didn't work. Long story short, this issue is still not getting fixed yet.  I would not buy Acura again."
acura,mdx,2008,SXY, 07/05/2008,"Lives up to ""Sports Sedan of SUVs"" label",pos,"Bought the MDX for utility, but drive it for fun now.  I have an older Audi A4 quattro sedan, and was looking for a larger vehicle with more reliability for my weekend golf and ski trips.  Didn't think I would prefer driving this full time.  It corners as well as the A4!  I can also load lots of gear in the back, and rear seat passengers sit in comfort.  I compared this to the BMW X3, X5, 328xi wagon, Infiniti EX35, FX35, and the smaller sibling RDX.  The MDX has an unbeatable combination of performance, utility, luxury, and price!  Yes, price!  While gas prices are high, you can get this vehicle for under invoice prices!  "
acura,mdx,2008,Salil, 09/30/2007,2008 MDX with Tech Package,pos,"Just purchased the 2008 MDX with Tech Package. It's a great solid SUV with AWD std. This SUV is very good compared to other luxury SUV (the lexus RX350 is too small inside, the BMW 5 series is too expensive, the Cadillac SRX is too much of a station wagon, and the Escalade is too big). We love the backup camera and the navigation, worth every penny. I would say Acura has done a wonderful job outside and inside, although there are some cost cutting methods implemented like the door handles. I really wish the tech package had the automatic trunk (hatch) release where is opens up completely. You have to buy the Ent. Pack to get that. Overall it's a great SUV at this price point."
acura,mdx,2008,Nick D, 03/19/2018,Love this car,pos,"Solid, great ride, excellent pick up. Other than the gas mileage, excellent car!  Strong performance is worth the extra gas cost. Strongly recommend it.
"
acura,mdx,2008,OC MDX, 06/02/2008,Best For Four,pos,"If you are moving 4 adults, this is the best vehicle in the segment.  Lots of others have uncomfortable second row seats.  It is as fun to drive as something this size can be.  Great power to weight ratio once you are rolling.  Great highway cruiser, effortless and it does not wear you out in transit.  We have not gotten to really use the 4WD yet.  We have had it for 7 months.  "
acura,mdx,2008,CDouty, 06/06/2008,The jury is still out,pos,"I've had my MDX for three weeks and can't say that I love it. Chose it over RX350 because I wanted something different - around here if you drive an RX you see yourself coming and going. Had 3 MB MLs, very happy with them, especially the last one, but didn't like the new ones. The MDX feels very solid and safe, and my daughters think the interior is huge. It is no longer than our ML, but it is wider. Acceleration kind of sluggish, mileage so far not as good as my MLs. The interior looks cheaper than my 2005 ML, but in fairness, so did the standard interior of the new MLs. Too much gadgetry for my taste, but my husband drove it to work one day and loved it. Hope it grows on me."
acura,mdx,2008,Edmund, 06/10/2008,Love this car but...,pos,"This is my 2nd vehicle from Honda first being an Odyssey, which was great except for the run flat tire issues.  I sold my '07 X5 3.0 & leased this car and saving a lot of money on the monthly payment. Compared to the X5, the MDX is roomier, more high tech, better acceleration & breaking and priced well below the X5. However, there is no comparison when it comes to build quality and attention to details as the X5 wins hands down."
acura,mdx,2008,HI MDX, 06/14/2008,A Good All Around SUV,pos,"Had this SUV for 2 months now.  I had more problems with customer service from the dealship than the vehicle.  I did have the b-pillar plastic trims replace because they were bowing outward and the plastic trim on the side of the passenger side dash.  The adjustable rate shocks are worthless.  Comfort and Sport modes feel the same, very spongy."
acura,mdx,2008,B'ham Alabama, 06/15/2008,SUV version of the TL,pos,"I've owned two Acura TLs previous to purchasing the 2008 MDX. The MDX feels like and handles like the TL. I'm very pleased so far. The MDX doesn't have the spunk that the TL did, but I appreciate the compromise because it gets fair gas mileage for a mid-sized SUV. My wife and kids love the MDX."
acura,mdx,2008,Jason, 06/15/2008,Great total package,pos,"My wife and I wanted a vehicle that could fit a growing family, carry a lot of stuff, and have AWD. We looked at the MDX, Highlander, Acadia, 08/09 Pilots, and CX-9. Final decision came down to MDX, CX-9, and Highlander. I've always liked the MDX since 2001, and with the dealer incentive, it made it easier to justify the price jump. The MDX drives very smoothly with ample power. Handling and comfort is very nice for a vehicle this size. The interior is nicer than the competitors although the GT CX-9 is pretty good, too. The exterior looks rugged yet has enough curves to avoid being boxy. Have not owned it long, but I expect typical Honda/Acura reliability."
acura,mdx,2008,twosweetbabes, 06/30/2008,Pleasure for All,pos,"As a busy mom of 6 year old twins, I needed the size of an SUV, but didn't like the size of my Expedition.  My kids love the ease of this vehicle and I love all the bells and whistles.  The navigation is by far the easier I have ever used, the voice recognition is very useful, can command even climate control!  All controls are easy to use and the dashboard is just beautiful.  Very smooth ride and an absolute pleasure to own.  Fuel economy is not as good as I had hoped, but to be expected in this size vehicle/motor.  I would recommend the MDX to anyone w/ children, my kids can open/close the doors w/ ease and the back seat is very comfortable.  The safety features are top-notch as well."
acura,mdx,2008,cb, 07/11/2008,Solid ride,pos,"So far a great purchase.  Gas mileage has been better than expected.  Ride is smooth, shifts quietly, handles very well, lots of power, brakes are very responsive.  Plenty of leg room.  Base model is very well-equipped with everything we wanted."
acura,mdx,2008,MeBuyToo, 07/14/2008,MDX Tech w/ PTG - Steel Blue,pos,"Great ride; words cant express how much I love this car. The car is nothing but classy inside and out.  It stands out on the road and it's always the best looking vehicle in the parking lot.  Kudos to Acura for coming up with technology ideas that leads us in the 21st century.  Nav is working great; traffic incidents works.  Hands free link works.  Climate control is really good; super handling, plenty of go power; stereo sounds great. The voice commands works well for me, even with the windows down.  With all its features it's best to get to know the voice commands. Thank goodness they work.  Considered Lexus RX350, BMW X5, Volvo C90.  MDX design and Technology value outstanding.   "
acura,mdx,2008,jp82765, 07/18/2008,Great SUV for family,pos,"I looked at many luxury SUVs and loved the MDX. It is extremely spacious, comfortable, fun to drive, navigation is great, sound system is great, and handles very well. The only thing it lacks is it could use a smoother ride. The ride is not as smooth as the Lexus or EMrcadise, but it is also much less. Great for 2 kids and 2 small dogs. I have yet to experience any problems with the truck and the fuel eco. is average for an SUV. "
acura,mdx,2008,MeBuyToo, 07/22/2008,Great Car,pos,"I love this car. It gives you a lot of confidence on the road.  It has good pick up, it's quiet, pretty smooth, it feels safe, the music sounds good, love the navi, especially getting the traffic incidents in the morning; I havent had any problems to report.  I researched this car pretty much in depth before buying it, so its pretty much what I expected it to be. I considered a RX-350 test drove it twice; test drove the MDX twice.  I felt the MDX had much more going for it in terms of style, technology and the MDX was packaged much better."
acura,mdx,2008,David, 07/26/2008,"Love this car! Sold my ipod, though.",pos,"We absolutely have loved owning and driving the MDX.  We traded in a Tahoe Z71 and thought we wouldn't have enough room (two toddlers, stroller, large dog), but we think we have much more usable room with the lower doors and fold-away third row seat.  The rear-seat DVD controls are all in the center console - fabulous for parents of toddlers; they also have a remote control that older kids can use.  The navigation system is easy to use and loaded with restaurant and hotel info.  The acceleration is brisk and driving is very enjoyable.  I hate saying it, but it does drive like a (powerful) car.    "
acura,mdx,2008,bruno, 07/25/2008,Great luxury SUV,pos,"I bought this car after researching many. It has the best of everything. Most room, most comfortable, great sound, and very spacious. The Lexus and Mercedes were too small, the BMW too rough of a ride, and the Porsche too expensive. Perfect for the price. The only thing I can complain about is a slight tire noise it has, but so did all the other SUVs"
acura,mdx,2008,Boris Milev, 07/28/2008,This is exactly what I was hoping for!!!,pos,"Acura has done a great job. I was originally looking at VW Touareg which I still love but since Acura arrived to China I fell in love with this car.  The interior quality is slightly inferior to Touareg but otherwise it is a great car. Industry-leading SH-AWD (Honda is one more time riding the waves of innovation) and superb GPS system are just awesome. Feels and drives like a luxury sedan. Offers plenty of space (I am 6'3"" tall). Sound system, air-con are just great."
acura,mdx,2008,Tim, 08/02/2008,Great SUV,pos,"I'm in the market for a new vehicle to replace my other car and since I have been relying so heavily on consumer reviews from this website, thought I would write one for the MDX.  It's a great car - very reliable, no problems whatsoever.  Quiet, luxurious interior, tremendous AWD handling, smooth transition, nice power, flexible interior.  Fuel economy is not great - I get around 23 MPG on the highway at 73 MPH with cruise set, but around 17 in town.  The car is just awesome and now that I am looking for new cars again to replace our other one, I am focused on the Acura brand for its quality.  If you are in market for upscale SUV, this is the one to get."
acura,mdx,2008,MSW, 08/08/2008,"So Far, So Good",pos,"The car is very comfortable even for a 6'6"" guy like myself.  The ""sit test"" eliminated many other models. I've only had it for 2 weeks, but so far, no major complaints.  I got 17.3 MPG on the first tank in mostly rush hour traffic which was surprising.    "
acura,mdx,2008,wtliao, 12/18/2007,Best Luxury SUV in the class,pos,"This is my first SUV after driving sedan for 15 years. MDX drives like a sports car! Love SHAWD handling and ride quality is comfy and quiet. The 5-speed auto transmission works flawlessly. I should've bought the sport package for sportier ride and sexy sport rims but we figure save additional 2K for my kids education funds. Navigation system is easy to use with voice recognition system. I think it's the best luxury SUV in this class for a 45K value! Complaints: Bluetooth phonebook import only works for very limited cell phone models. Gas mileage isn't great, only 17 city/21 highway, but it's a trade off for 300HP & SHAWD, I will never regret."
acura,mdx,2008,Tyler, 08/19/2008,Sporty,pos,"This is a great SUV with superior handling, comfort, and overall appearance. Fuel economy is edging toward the v8 area, but considering the size of the mdx, it gets pretty good mileage. Ride is very smooth and the 300 hp gets it up and going quickly. Recommend the mdx to anyone looking into an SUV with the performance and luxury you get with Acura, and the reliability you can expect from Honda."
acura,mdx,2008,Todd, 08/24/2008,Great quality car,pos,Second MDX we have owned.  First generation was good but unexciting.  New MDX quality matches all of the German competition with Honda reliability.  Very solid feel and intuitive electronics.  Nav and bluetooth are great.  ELS sound system is excellent - especially when surround is turned on.  
acura,mdx,2008,BH, 09/03/2008,Great SUV that's Fun to Drive,pos,"Compared to Highlander, X5, 09 Pilot, and GM SUVs.  MDX was best compromise.  Owned a 2002 model that was very reliable.   "
acura,mdx,2008,DG, 09/03/2008,"Love it, Love it, Love it",pos,"Looked at everything out there and the MDX won hands down.  Ride is excellent, handling is great, sound system is incredible.  Voice activation for almost everything you want to either control or get information on. A little temperamental with recognition of commands but if you're clear then it's OK.  Blue tooth is great.  Added chrome side steps, body molding and luggage rack.  Black on black combination turns alot of heads.  Acura doing great financing and going way low on pricing.  First time I ever owned an Acura, will definitely consider Acura for other vehicle purchases.  Lots of power in engine although premium should probably be used most of time."
acura,mdx,2008,DisplayName, 09/05/2008,Acura worth every penny,pos,"Purchased an 08 MDX a month ago.  Researched with great detail to determine which mid-sized SUV I would be the best choice.  I looked at BMW X5, Volvo XC90, Mercedes ML, Audi Q7, even Chevy Tahoe LTZ and concluded that the Acura was the best choice for the money.  Hondas/Acuras are legendary for thier reliability and resale value.  All things considered Acura is #1. Overall the MDX is a fabulous vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,Karigirl, 09/06/2008,Awesome Vehicle!,pos,"I leased my new Acura MDX almost a year ago and still love it every time I get in it.  My previous car was a 2004 Acura TL and I thought I couldn't find a vehicle I loved more than that until I got the MDX.  The handling, the transmission, the power, the comfort, the styling, just about everything!  I wish the gas mileage was better but I am lead-footed and I am averaging 17 mpg.  When I drive mostly highway, I get closer to 22.  We recently bought a second car, an '02 Maxima, and I couldn't wait to get back into the Acura. I forever will be an Acura fan!  Best cars on the road, in my opinion (well, at least in my price range-LOL!). Oh, and did I mention, I have the BASE model!"
acura,mdx,2008,Cindy, 10/05/2008,Better mpg than advertised,pos,"Shortly after buying our MDX, we went a 2,000 mile trip, mostly freeway miles with lots of mountains, averaged 22.9 mpg. That was a relief as I was fearful it might be even worse. The more we drove it, the more we liked it. Great combination of fun, comfort, and utility. Better visibility than originally thought. Never met a hill we couldn't keep accelerating up. I am almost 6'2"", my husband is 6'3"", we both have plenty of room up front and in the rear outboard seats, but the center second row seat is not for full- sized adults. This is basically a 4 person vehicle.  My previous car was a 2006 TL, which sat too low for me, the MDX has a good step out height and is easy to get into and out of."
acura,mdx,2008,nic, 10/16/2008,best suv on the road,pos,"Great ride for the buck, we love car like ride. Great performance inside and out, Acura did a great job building this luxury suv, anyone who likes to drive an suv this one is definitely the pick"
acura,mdx,2008,nemavezee, 10/31/2008,Another great Acura,pos,"Traded in 04 Pilot which was an extremely great vehicle - but this is sooooo much better.  This handles like a sports car, when in sport mode.  There is no wind or road noise. No rattles.  OK fuel economy, considering it's an suv. SH-AWD is truly amazing combined with Dynamic Ride Control in sport mode.  My other car is an 04TL 6MT/nav - no issues, love the car. Looked at Audi Q7 before MDX and I liked it, but MDX felt better during test drive, and handling is better on MDX. Acceleration seems smoother with MDX, and feels more powerful at any speed. Transmission (too bad only 5 speed) is very smooth;  This is my 4th Acura so far - and so far very pleased with all of them. "
acura,mdx,2008,Addy, 11/22/2008,Reminds me of my BMW 540i. Very elegant.,pos,"Traded in a 2006 Toyota Sienna LE for the '08 MDX Sport with black on black. Unlike many other autos, this SUV is truly unisex. I got this for this for my wife but would love driving to work ;-)  It really reminds me of the BMW 540i Sport I used to drive some time back. Do not expect a Lexus RX style smooth ride with the Sport package. It's a road hugging SUV, with tighter steering and superb pick-up. The 300 HP engine is pretty responsive "
acura,mdx,2008,Gurm, 11/27/2008,Excellent SUV... way to go!,pos,"I bought this 2008 Acura MDX sports new here in state of WA 3 weeks back... drives like dream. I chose it over Lincoln MKX, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5 and Lexus RX 400. MDX is very sporty both in looks & driving with option of comfort mode just by pressing a switch (but you'll be tempted to keep it in sports mode). I drive Audi S4 too & still respect Acura's sporty drive for an SUV. The Acura navigation is very easy to use, bluetooth & handsfree link are nice additions too. Suggested improvements below."
acura,mdx,2008,Gunn, 12/13/2008,A nice car from Acura,pos,"Before to buy this car, I have looked at Lexus 350, ML350 and CX9 finally choose this one because of its price, equipment and 7 passengers capacity.  I have owned this car for three months. It works great with no problems at all. Just enjoy the fun when drive it. This is my first Acura, some of my opinions are: Gas mileage is quite low (13 mpg) in local roads. When slowing down speed, transmission gear shift is noticeable. Comparing to X5 3.0 (my other car) acceleration and handling is inferior even MDX has more powerful engine.  Cabin noise level can be lower."
acura,mdx,2008,JamesT, 12/12/2008,Happy Buyer,pos,I purchase my MDX with the tech pkg a week before a taking a long thanksgiving trip out of town.  I must say that this vehicle is truly amazing. I traded in my BMW for this vehicle and this vehicle is every bit as good. I drove the BMW X5 and Infiniti FX series and the MDX proved to be the better value and overall better vehicle. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.
acura,mdx,2008,qwik_footed, 12/27/2008,The Verdict after 1 Year of Driving it..,pos,"Had the car 1+ years now and can now give objective feedback without the bias of ""new car purchase"" emotions.  My wife's been the primary driver to haul around our daughter (now 16 mo. old) and she loves it.  Bold exterior style & big interior compared to other vehicles (RX330, FX35) was a big reason for buying.  We went with the Entertainment system as it was the only way to get the power tailgate at the time, but it's been great for entertaining the baby on trips. The car has been perfect EXCEPT for a constant, infuriating rattle around passenger door area (even at low speed) that shouldn't exist on a $40k car (dealer couldn't fix). Overall, love it, but it's really a 2nd tier luxury SUV."
acura,mdx,2008,JERRY, 12/30/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"I bought this car about a year ago and have about 13500 miles on the car. This is a really great SUV. Remembering that this is an SUV the mileage is not too bad. I get about 17-18 mpg mixed (more freeway) and about 21-22 mpg freeway at an average speed of 75-80 mph. The back seats are comfortable. They can recline a little but not all the way flat. The third row seats are only meant for kids. Have had 2 problems so far. The air vent on the top of the dashboard pop out and was fixed by the dealer on the third try. I told them glue it down. The CD player jammed and was replaced by the dealer at no cost. All in all, I am very satisfied with this car and have already recommended it to friends."
acura,mdx,2008,Farid, 01/10/2009,Really Satisfied!,pos,"I'm a car enthusiast and then for buying this car I searched and test drove many cars during a 3 months period. Between all SUVs that I tested - such as BMW X5, BMW X3, Mercedes ML 350 & 500, Lexus RX, Mazda SUVs and many others - I am 100% certain that you can not find such a combination of handling, comfort, space, reliability and design with a very competitive price in another car. Also I love the technology package and I think that it has one of the best navigation systems. I have driven the car for near 15 months and 18000 miles and I've never had any problem with it. I think the seats are very comfortable with a good design. Handling is awesome and driver's position and view is perfect."
acura,mdx,2008,comet123, 01/22/2009,Nice SUV,pos,"Have driven 4,500 miles. Overall, great vehicle. In the snow is great. Solid like a tank. "
acura,mdx,2008,mchina, 02/05/2009,"Always fun, Never bored!",pos,"I test drove some of the other luxury SUVs out there, but none compare with the ride and the handling I get from my MDX. For the price you really get almost more than you can ever ask for. Fully loaded with options, some I didn't even know I wanted, its a great ride around town, out on a twisty back road, or cruising down the interstate. The sound system is exceptional. And the DVD keeps my son very happy with movies and games. And on cold winter days, my back seat passengers loved the heated seats. Navigation and bluetooth are great, especially with the voice activation. The SH-AWD makes me feel secure in any kind of driving environment. Just want to drive fast and push it to the limit!"
acura,mdx,2008,Judith Temple, 03/31/2009,Best SUV Bang for your buck!,pos,"After having owned the BMW X3, the MDX is a pleasure to drive.  Reliability is great for 25,000 miles. Only things wrong are Bluetooth; rings and cannot hear whose on the other end and many viable addresses do not show up on Navigation system. Dealer service excellent.  A few miss-steps in design; no lights for A/C controls at night; rear view pic doesn't come on in reverse for 10 seconds, some wind noise, transmission can be rough and erratic.  No ipod plug which I didn't realize until after I purchased. Front end design could be improved, very masculine. Sounds like a lot but I do really like this car.  Also test drove BMW X5 and Lexus 400."
acura,mdx,2008,Eric Dise, 05/02/2009,Excellent Replacement,pos,"I owned a 2004 MDX Touring and traded for the new edition. I am very satisfied with my decision. The pep this has over my old MDX is undeniable. The comfort is much improved too. This 2008 is equipped exactly as my 2004 was but thanks to the poor economy, I paid nearly $3K less than the 04 as a model closeout! The MDX is fun to drive and nearly feels like a car. (Nearly...) I am very pleased with the decision to purchase this vehicle and look to have it for many years!"
acura,mdx,2008,Former Cayenne Owner, 01/03/2008,Great sport SUV,pos,"Traded a Cayenne and could not be happier.  The 300 HP provides great power, especially when downshifted.  Base model has all any true driver would need.  Really, how often does anyone need to use a GPS or call a restaurant while on the road or, for that matter, not know what is behind their vehicle.  This is a vehicle which can complete with the top SUVs on the market and retain its value.  Third seat is not for adults.  SH-AWD is  truly for those who want to ""push"" the vehicle while maintaining control in all conditions.  I have found the seating position for the driver to be very comfortable.  Sound system with the subwoffer can blow your teenager out of the vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,paulv, 01/09/2008,Must Have,pos,I have had the car for a month now. I must admit this is more of a great crossover SUV than I expected. The base model has all the things you need for your life. I got 17.4 miles per gallon in city drive. Not bad at all.
acura,mdx,2008,jb, 01/14/2008,exhilarating,pos,fun to drive! great looks! high tech features! ample horsepower compared to its direct competitors with the same engine displacement! better fuel consumption for its horsepower!
acura,mdx,2008,bob, 01/20/2008,Best vehicle ever!,pos,"I traded in a Lexus for this car.  It is way better than the Lexus.  It handles better, is more comfortable, looks better, and gets much better fuel economy.  And the overall quality is the best I've seen in some cars.  Overall, I can say that this is a great car that everyone should buy."
acura,mdx,2008,oscarkat3, 01/23/2008,Great Vehicle,pos,"This is a great all around vehicle. It is roomy but nimble.  The ride and handling combo are refined and strike a perfect balance.  There are no tippy sensations driving this car.   The seat comfort and driving position are perfect, just absolutely perfect. People of very different sizes can all find enough room and the right position.  The memory settings are fantastic for multi driver households.  The cargo room is good."
acura,mdx,2008,Richpat95, 06/14/2009,Handles like a dream,pos,Nothing on the road can compare to this vehicle.  I have driven every one and this is the crossover.  Handles like a dream and technology is so seamless and easy to use.  Sound system is simply remarkable.
acura,mdx,2008,JnJ, 07/08/2009,Great Car-like SUV... still miss my car,neu,"My experience with the Acura MDX 2008 has been nice. I came from driving a 2005 Nissan Max and needed something bigger and better with safety for me at the time (10 mth old son). The MDX does get up and go, but not initially. I have had it less than a year with just 11,000 hwy miles on it and have never had a problem until now. Took a trip to NC and came back with a loud humming noise. Turned out it was bad wheel bearings. Hopefully once fixed, will not happen again. Other than that all has been well and I am happy with the customer service I have received."
acura,mdx,2008,john, 08/27/2009,Very nice rig,pos,"I now have over 30k miles and have had a good experience with this SUV. I've had a Lexus GX, ML 500 and this vehicle compares very well. Not as powerful but gets the job done very well. It handles awesome and once the rpm's are up there it rips. A bit anemic off idle though. I tow a snowmobile trailer and the dealer tells me I need new shocks which are covered under warranty thankfully. I'd recommend this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2008,Buck, 11/12/2009,Love my MDX!,pos,"Best car I have ever driven.  I came from a mini van and wanted something more sporty.  Handling is great.  Easy to parallel park.  Turns on a dime.  I love how it looks.  Few things they should improve on: paint chips easily, bluetooth poor quality, navigation system needs much more updates, coin tray cover broke, running board separated, needs a right arm rest or higher console, a lot of wind noise unless you remove the roof rack, need a place to put my purse. When getting in the car I wish the seat would not advance right away; this makes it hard to get in. Had roaring noise in drivers front.  We already had to replace the bearings!!  Even with all this I still love the car."
acura,mdx,2008,Norcal221, 11/15/2009,20K Miles - Little Flaws,pos,"After 20K miles and 24 mos of owning the base model, still a blast to drive on dry, wet or snowy roads. SH-AWD outperforms my 4wd 08 Tahoe. Had electrical glitches that the dealer had to fix: CD player failed, exterior temp. thermometer failed, sunroof failed. 2nd stage clearcoat not premium-needs to be detailed every 6 mos or so to restore the like-new luster. Forget the 3rd row seating unless you have little kids; no legroom. 2nd row fits 3 adults comfortably. No other problems! Currently averaging 18 mpg & tires starting to fade due to aggressive driving. Worth every penny!"
acura,mdx,2008,Satisfied, 11/19/2009,Loved it...,pos,"3 yr lease just expired...I'd buy again.  I absolutely loved this car.   I prefer Honda or Toyota, Acura is my favorite.  By the time I had equipped comparable vehicles (BMW, Lexus, actually), there was no comparison in price.  Don't get me wrong, BMW and Lexus were fantastic, but about $8K more when comparably equipped.   Leasing fit me...I drive 12,000/yr.  Gas mileage was just as advertised...sometimes a mile or two better.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was the giant shield design on the front...which is now apparently on all Acura vehicles."
acura,mdx,2008,Rich, 04/12/2010,Very Good Mid Size SUV,pos,"Just turned 40,000 miles and still love my vehicle except for poor gas mileage and weak exterior paint that nicks/chips easily. Car rides very smoothly with lots of passing power. Quality and Reliability up to my current mileage have been excellent.  "
acura,mdx,2008,Tony V., 02/04/2008,I bought another one,pos,Had an '06 MDX Touring that was totalled by a drunk driver. Looked around for something different but always came back to the MDX. Bought Sport model with navi and ent. Love it so far. Runs great (400 miles into it). Many compliments on style and looks. Very happy with purchase.
acura,mdx,2008,E-Bohm, 02/11/2008,AWESOME,pos,"Fantastic drive, makes my 130 mile daily commute both fun and comfortable. "
acura,mdx,2008,Rhubbard, 02/14/2008,Who could ask for anything more?,pos,"Acura hit the nail on the head with the 08 MDX. The ride is smooth, the engine is powerful, and the features are top notch. To get a comparable vehicle (BMW X5, Audi, Lexus), the price skyrockets. Acura bundles it all together without compromising on quality."
acura,mdx,2008,wen, 02/16/2008,Poor build quality,neu,"Bought this car two months ago, sport model with ent-package and other bells and whistles. Supposed to enjoy this luxury vehicle, but having nothing but troubles. Been back to the dealer repair shop multiple times to repair multiple defects. Distorted mirror, defect gas door, leather peeling off the steering wheel and roof molding loosening. Last weekend, the roof rack cap flew away while driving the car on highway. It is very poor detail work on this car. It will be seventh trip to fix gas door and roof rack next next week."
acura,mdx,2008,wingshooter, 02/16/2008,Best value in a midsize luxury SUV,pos,"Replaced a 2006 Murano with this vehicle and could not be happier with my choice. Test drove the ML350, X5, Lexus GX470, and XC90. The MDX beats them all for THOUSANDS less. The SH-AWD is a technological wonder.  Handling is agile and the ride soaks up the bumps well. With 300hp on tap, it move when you want it to.  This is my first Honda product and I'm really impressed with the fit and finish and build quality Seats are very comfy.  All said this SUV has as much Sport as it does Utility, wrapped in Honda reliability."
acura,mdx,2008,Bigbelt, 02/26/2008,You get what you pay for,pos,"This car is like driving a sports car in an SUV.  We were downsizing from a Chevy Avalanche, and this was a great find.  The fuel economy is the only real drawback that we can say at this point in time about the vehicle.  You really should test drive this vehicle if you are considering anything in this class.  Much more responsive than the Lexus and a lot more room.  Looks like Acura did a great job of redesigning the whole vehicle.  This is a true pleasure to be behind the wheel.  Acceleration is very smooth, shifting is as well.  Braking and handling is next to none."
acura,mdx,2008,SanAntonioSweety, 03/01/2008,I LOVE MY '08 MDX!,pos,"My truck is great & I play hard, it seems as though it's built to last! Just came back from a trip to D.C. made it to D.C. in 28 hours from San Antonio! Took the scenic route thru ATL on the way home & made a few other stops. The MDX provided entertainment for my son via dvd & the nav was on point for me! Would have been lost up a creek w/o that!"
acura,mdx,2008,RV, 10/08/2007,Satisfied,pos,"Hello, Have had this car for three weeks, bought the tech/entertainment package (blk/blk). Car is beautiful inside and out. Navigation is easy to use, if you've had navigation before.  HandsFree Link with our blue tooth phones is awesome.  Car accelerates and handles excellently.  We own an integra before this so we knew it was going to be a quality vehicle and are not disappointed.  10 speaker stereo is amazing. Kids can listen/watch DVDs in back while we listen to radio in front.  Can't complaining about gas mileage, car is full sized SUV not a Honda civic!! Our MDX gets same gas mileage as our Pathfinder, if you want excellent gas mileage buy something smaller. Awesome car!!"
acura,mdx,2008,fort99, 10/01/2007,Excellent SUV,pos,We bought ours a week ago. So far so good. Excellent handling especially compared to 4Runner. It would be perfect with less tire noise. 
acura,mdx,2008,V V, 10/02/2007,2008 MDX-Tech,pos,"I just bought this about a month now. Driving is so fun, comfortable, easy to use the navigation. At night the interior looks just like a cockpit (I heard this word from my friends who saw my SUV). Most of the essential features are standard, so there are no additional expenses for a luxury SUV. The handling of this SUV is very nice, any sharp turn, neither passinger nor driver feels much body sway as like other car or SUVs. I rate this SUV 8-9/10 for most of the features."
acura,mdx,2008,Lee, 10/30/2007,Great Value,pos,I have always driven BMWs and the last car was the GX 470 Lexus.  The new 2008 Acura is an excellent value for the money.  It is about 12K less than the X5 for the same amenities.  Very happy with the purchase.  I have not had it serviced yet so cannot give an opinion on that yet.
acura,mdx,2008,Mr. Wang, 10/31/2007,Acura is Awesome!,pos,"I just purchased my new 2008 Acura MDX Sport and I love it. My trade was a 2004 Acura TL. The MDX is very quick, has great handling, smooth ride, and the fit and finish is excellent. The interior design is very intuitive and the navigation system is easy to use. There is plenty of passenger and storage room. I love the exterior design. Must have accessories are the sport running boards, side body molding, roof rails/cross bars, and the front and rear silver garnish. This is definitely a high performance SUV with lots of luxury!"
acura,mdx,2008,Tchello, 11/13/2007,Outstanding SUV !,pos,"After thorough research that included major brands (BMW, MB, Volvo & Audi) the MDX came on top. The standard model comes with leather, moonroof and 3rd row seat. Got the Sport package with technology and it's a bargain compared with the other, more fancy, brands. At least $10K less for a very similar, and in many cases, superior product. If you don't need the status of a BMW or Mercedes, this is the way to go. I traded my Audi A4, and I'm very happy I did so. Overall, very solid and handles great. Smooth."
acura,mdx,2008,gaawb, 11/18/2007,Outstanding vehicle,pos,"For the money, this is the finest vehicle on the road.  The nav system is unequaled and incredibly impressive.  I test drove the X5, FX45, MKX, Q7, and Enclave. It was a tough decision between the X5 and MDX but I will never look back. I've driven 2000 miles and it is an absolute pleasure in every way.  The 300hp engine actually puts a smile on my face when I punch it.  If you are looking for a crossover, this is a no-brainer."
acura,mdx,2008,Ali Samara, 11/29/2007,Awesome,pos,"This is a great car. I've had it for about three weeks and it is just so fun to drive.  I added the 19"" chrome wheels and it just looks great.  The 300 hp engine is powerful and the nav system is the best on the market. Don't know how I ever lived without it.  Best cross over suv on the market."
acura,mdx,2008,Mike, 11/19/2007,Great Car!,pos,"I just purchased a new 2008 Acura MDX.  We have 2 kids and were looking for an SUV with a 3rd row of seats.  Test drove the X5, Buick Enclave and Mazda, Lexus, Volvo and Chevy. This car was by far more superior for the room, price and comfort."
acura,mdx,2008,BobinSFCA, 03/05/2008,Well Built at a Bargain Price,pos,"This vehicle replaced a 2005 Honda Pilot EXL.  I had such good luck with my other Hondas I decided to stay with the brand. The price of the MDX compared to what it offers is a ""no brainer.""  It drives like a combination of my old Pilot and an S2000 I use to have. I often forget it is an SUV. The build quality is spectacular; first new car I have had that has no rattles or defects. "
acura,mdx,2008,seamas, 03/08/2008,Performance with Style,pos,The experience in driving the MDX is in a category altogether different to any other SUV I have driven. The handling is superb and when coupled with the comfort and styling of the interior makes it an exhilarating and luxurious experience which was unexpected.  
acura,mdx,2008,leennp, 12/03/2007,Love this vehicle,pos,"Purchased this vehicle to replace Suburban and its string of problems and have been nothing but pleased with the MDX.  Even like the nav system which I only got so I could get the DVD and rear lift gate.  Highly recommend this vehicle, gas mileage has been better than stated."
acura,mdx,2008,Big Fan!, 03/30/2008,Wouldn't want anything else,pos,"Previously owned (and loved) an '01 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Looked at another JGC and found out that mine was superior to the current JGCs.  I shopped BMW, Infiniti, Lexjus, BMW X5.  MDX is easiest and most comfortable car or SUV I have ever owned, very quiet and smooth.  Navi took practice, but now is easy to operate.  I won't own another car that doesn't have it.  AWD is like you're on rails.  Stereo is second to none & iPod adapter is simple.  I don't use XM or real-time traffic, but I would b/c they were great during the free trial period."
acura,mdx,2008,Better than the lex, 04/10/2008,Very Pleased,pos,"Coming from an 05 Lexus RX, this is a significant improvement.  The MDX feels solid on the road.  Handles firm but comfortable on the highway.  Havent had a chance to check it out in the snow but looking forward to it.  Gas mileage could be better but its got 300 horses, cant have everything.  Nav system is a big plus.  Easy to use and comes with bluetooth and a very good sound system in the package.  "
acura,mdx,2008,tammyd, 04/13/2008,Love this car!,pos,"I love this car.  I owned an MDX before purchasing the 2008 with the new body style and roomier interior.  I opted for the loaded version.  I think the joystick navigation is wonderful and so much easier to use.  I also love the new body style.  The inside is roomier than the older version.  With trying to stay in the midsize SUV and having a 3rd row seat, this can't be beat.  The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row.  Also, with the position of the handles now being in the middle instead of the top of the seats, it is much easier to pull the seats up when using the 3rd row.  One simple tug and ""presto"" - extra seating.  Great buy!  You'll love it!"
acura,mdx,2008,v10Acura, 04/15/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"The only other car I was considering with it were the X5 and ML. The handling of SH-AWD simply blew us away. In my opinion it had significatnly less body roll then even the others. The ride is very confidence-inspiring in rain, sun and snow. The sound system is absolutely incredible. Furthermore, I for one also really like the knob instead of touchscreen navigation. I find that the engine power is good from a standstill, but could use more power for passing. Certain speeds dont allow you to shift down to reach high revs required for optimal torque. As such sometimes you dont get sufficient acceleration. i also really like the styling. "
acura,mdx,2008,rt, 04/21/2008,Luv my '08 MDX,pos,"Replaced a Honda CRV with this but not before test driving the Mercedes ML350 and ML320, BMW X3 and X5 and the Lexus RX. This vehicle was by far smoother, more comfortable, more powerful and somehow more economical! "
acura,mdx,2008,Mike, 04/23/2008,Great SUV,pos,"This is my first SUV and I couldn't be happier.  Choice was between an 08 Highlander and 08 MDX and for a few thousand more you get a much more impressive interior, better handling & steering feedback, a more agile ride, and HID headlamps.  Fuel economy has been much more impressive than expected - ~24 highway, ~19 city, 22 avg with 65/35 highway/city driving (1,300 mi on odo).  Only major gripes are you can't read the stereo display screen with sun glare from sunroof (even on max brightness) & no compass is present."
acura,mdx,2008,Lexy, 04/26/2008,Good Value,pos,Dealer painted the silver shield on grille the car color giving a sharper look. Traded a 2003 MDX which was a great vehicle. The new car longer wheelbase and more weight gives a smooth ride. Chose the MDX over the Lexus RX. Bigger inside and out with later technology.
acura,mdx,2008,shaba, 04/29/2008,2008 Acura MDX,pos,"Love this vehicle. I was actually considering the Buick Enclave before I test drove the MDX. The MDX feels much more solid, has smooth acceleration, lots of power, corners great!! You feel much more stable in the MDX than the other vehicles in this class. The interior is classy ! You really feel safe in this cage!!"
acura,mdx,2008,Albert, 05/03/2008,Right Choice,pos,"Test drove Lexus RX 350, Volvo XC90, Pilot, and 2009 Murano before selecting the MDX. It's the best in class.  Great SUV. It runs much better after the initial 500 miles or so. GPM got better too.  Some of the accessories should have been made standard (roof rail, side molding). The plastic door handle and the same color plastic on the steering wheel make the interior look cheap. Acura should have made them better and add a few hundred dollars to the based. This is sold by Honda/Acura as a luxury SUV. "
acura,mdx,2008,Ryki, 05/01/2008,My 3rd MDX,pos,"This is my 3rd MDX, I have had a 2001, a 2005 and now a 2008. This is the Best Bang for the Buck SUV on the road. Looks great inside and out. Good performance, good handling, decent feul economy (16 mpg on mixed driving) for a 300 horsepower engine and all these vehicles have proved very reliable.   "
acura,mdx,2008,CLEW, 05/05/2008,Acura MDX = Amazing Sport SUV,pos,"We just purchased an 08 MDX with Tech and Entertainment with the power rear door.  I drove X5 (3.0 and 4.8), Caddy SRX, and Mazda CX9 and hands down the Acura was the choice to make.  It handles like (or better really) than the BMW with so many more options for the price.  If you want a great, luxury SUV and want the best quality and value go with the MDX.  The handling is so impressive, and the power from the 3.7 litre V6 will shock you.  Navi is so easy to use and the whole sound system is unreal!"
acura,mdx,2008,Billboy, 05/07/2008,Excellent value by comparison,pos,"We traded our 2005 BMW X5 for this 2008 Acura MDX.  The BMW was good, but the Acura is surprisingly better in many ways.  Actually handles better, has a quieter ride and more power than the BMW.  The interior is well-designed and matches up with our previous best in class, an Audi we owned a few years ago.  The cost of ownership will be only slightly higher ($39 for an oil change where the BMW was covered while under warranty), but the eventual cost should be lower.  The styling is what really caught my eye.  More muscular stance and presence, but more interior space."
acura,mdx,2008,gtfranklin, 05/08/2008,Can't believe it's 4600 lbs.,pos,"My previous 4 cars were 3 BMWs and a G35, and I finally found a crossover that didn't disappoint in the handling dept. This is actually fun to drive! My G35 and previous M3 were quicker, but didn't handle significantly better in most driving situations. Solid, comfortable, tons of space, and WAY less expensive that comp. X-5, Audi, etc. Mileage 19.4 in 1st 2000 miles."
acura,mdx,2008,Bradley, 05/13/2008,Outstanding Value,pos,"I researched and test drove everything else in this style of vehicle (Acadia, Buick, Nissan, Mazda, Honda).  For the money, this is the best by far.  The ride is excellent, the nav is great and the graphics are much better than GM.  I love the cockpit feel of the cabin and the comfort of the seating.  The exterior got my attention and the interior keeps it.  I have three children ages 10, 8 and 8 and we are in a carpool with two other kids for a total of 6 people in the vehicle.  We can easily fit one more.  We have 16.6 MPG with mixed driving (mostly driving in the local neighborhoods).  Got over 23 MPG when on the highway for a short period of time.  We look for reasons to drive places!"
acura,mdx,2008,Bert Viloria, 05/12/2008,Great SUV,pos,"I just bought my 2008 MDX a couple of weeks ago and I have been thoroughly impressed with its superb handling, amazing interior with all its electronic gadgetry, and beautiful exterior, which has not always pleased everyone.  The ride is smooth, aggressive, but not dull and lifeless.  The standard electronics available, even for my basic MDX is a long list and should easily please everyone!"
acura,mdx,2008,rndymn16, 05/17/2008,It's just okay,pos,"MDX rides nice but everything inside is basically ""cheap"". Voice recognition is not quite there. Also surprised that it's the only SUV that didn't come standard with roof rails."
acura,mdx,2008,richard mcmullen, 05/28/2008,Disappointed,neu,"I have owned 3 Hondas and 2 Acuras before. I had an 05 MDX and a 02 TL-S. I am very disappointed in the rigid ride of this vehicle. I have the base model. My 05 was softer and a more comfortable ride. I feel every bump in the road. I am suprised that Acura would not leave the base model as a more comfortable ride and give the stiffer ride to the sport package. There is a soft thump thump when I first start the car and reach 20 mph. I don't know if it is transmission, engine or suspension knock. There is a rattle on the pass door somewhere. The shifter is on the left of the center console and gets in the way of my right knee/leg. Info center is too small and in wrong place. No compass."
acura,mdx,2008,martin Harris, 12/17/2016,Drives itself,pos,"Only weakness large blind spots sold 2016.
"
acura,mdx,2008,chcaviar, 05/28/2018,Can't beat it,pos,"This is our 2nd MDX.  Poor mileage is because it has been mostly city driving.  Absolutely no real problems with the car.  Buying the new 2019 RDX.
"
acura,mdx,2008,SpecL Ed, 01/21/2020,Still going strong,pos,"Bought mine in 2009 w 18K miles.  Just turned 100K. Interior and exterior still look like new. Runs perfect. Still pulls strong 19MPG in city 25 highway. I'd like something newer but hard pressed to give it up. 
"
acura,mdx,2008,Lorraine, 07/19/2020,MDX met da expectations!,pos,"Great car. Quiet, smooth ride
"
acura,mdx,2009,Aaron, 09/27/2016,The Golden Retriever of Luxury SUV's,pos,"This is our first ACURA after previously coming from a Honda Odyssey.  The Reliability has been very good. No Major failures, and never left us on the road. Only one repair done under warranty, a right front wheel bearing.  All else has been standard service work.  Not the cheapest to maintain but not BMW outrageous either.   Gas mileage has been below expected at just about 16.5mpg for mostly city use, but the handling and power make it kinda hard not to goose it a bit! Speaking of handling, the SH-AWD is awesome, you can tell when the torque vectoring is taking place, but it's not obtrusive, in fact it's kinda of addicting to engage it.  Fun, fun, fun to drive especially on any winding road.  Plenty of interior room for our family of 4 and large dog for multiple 1000 mile + trips.  Overall excellent ownership experience and most likely will be a repeat MDX buyer.
"
acura,mdx,2009,brod77381, 05/28/2010,Favorite vehicle I've ever had!,pos,I love my MDX - it's my most favorite vehicle I've ever had!  I bought a pre-owned 2009 MDX w/Technology package in black with black interior.  I knew I wanted an SUV mid-size and looked at several.  The MDX gives you the most bang for your buck.
acura,mdx,2009,Gerald Kershner, 04/05/2016,You won't be disappointed! Great handling SUV!,pos,"Best SUV I've ever driven and owned. Take a test drive and see for yourself. Bought it used with noisy directional tread tires, replaced them with Acura OEM tires ... wow, what a difference.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Jessie P, 07/03/2009,Huge mistake!,neu,"Generally I buy cars based on my trust in a company. I've owned a total of 6 Honda products (including Acura - TL), and all of them have been outstanding. This vehicle is a big disappointment!!! Where do I begin? I buy Honda products (and Japanese vehicles in general) for their bulletproof reliability, but I've had numerous problems with this MDX - been to dealer 6 times! Electrical issues, and a Transmission issue, and some others....and the power/acceleration is very mediocre (300hp?? Yeah, right!), and the ENGINE is VERY NOISY and unrefined when accelerating!!! Shocking for a luxury vehicle. Terrible leather! Sound system, Nav and handling are the only good attributes of this vehicle."
acura,mdx,2009,Carl R, 11/16/2009,Great SUV,pos,"I just came out of an Audi A-8 yet needed a SUV.  I normally would not even consider a MDX however my wife bought an Acura RL in April and loved the car; the quality and ride was excellent so I elected to look at the MDX.  The ride is excellent and the finish is terrific. I felt the interior was nicer than the Q7.  The sound system in the vehicle (with the Tech package) is exceptional and better then in my previous Audi, Jaguar and Lexus. I love driving it!"
acura,mdx,2009,Shandu, 08/23/2015,"235,000 miles",neu,"There is a common electrical issue.  From the first 3000 miles there was a short in the radio meaning, when it get hot the sound would skip like a turn table skipping.  The XM radio, CD player, AM/FM and DVD player sound would skip.  Took it to several dealership from Long Island, Manhattan, and Westchester Acura.  No one could find the reason, each saying to return the car at the time that the sound is skipping.  Replace the first battery within one year.  Twice the battery was dead within six months.  Second time, dealer replace under warranty.  Third time, the discharge of the battery even though the vehicle was off cause my a/c compressor to blow.  The dealer said that the unit was drawing power even though it was off.  The pressure build to the point where it cause the unit to blow.  Dealer replace the battery and the A/C relay.  Also the constant drain on the battery which maybe linked to the HLF/blue tooth system.  I had to disconnect the HLF/blue took system.  Gas mileage is very weak.  Average about  15 miles per gallon on high way, due to heavy foot.  Keep in mind I travel at least 160 miles per day.  Yes, gas prices are high but I love my MDX.  It corners like a dream at 65-70 mph on a curvy two lane country road.   I am 6'1"" and sit very well In my captain seat.  The second row is hard to move forward for rear entry into the third row.  Michelin Tires are the best so far in terms of gas saving and road noise.  Have changed the following, tire road, oil plan, a/c relay switch, 3 battery on my fourth.   Wanted to be the owner who reaches over 500,000 miles but it will be expensive.
"
acura,mdx,2009,mend, 03/18/2009,Disappointed,neu,Vehicle is daily driver for my wife and she seems to like the car but this is the roughest riding vehicle I have ever driven. All small bumps and holes in the road are felt in the steering and suspension. Make sure that you drive the vehicle on a long test drive on all conditions of pavement as this was the mistake that I made. Have tried running the vehicle with the bare min. air pressure in the tires but not much helps. Hopefully the suspension will loosen up with time as I try not to ride in or drive this car which is quite a let down.
acura,mdx,2009,Enjay, 12/11/2009,Timing belt issues with a 2009 MDX,neu,"My 2009 MDX with 3500+ miles has been taken to dealer 3 times in the last month. Once I had to get it towed to dealership. First time I was told that they was issue with poor quality Timing belt pulley. So timing belt got shredded. They had to replace them both. They took almost week to replace it. Within a day, 2009 MDX developed issue. This time there was an issue with Catalytic converter. They took another week to replace. Again within two days, ""Check emission system"" came up again. This time I was told they would have to replace another catalytic converter and also sub converters. This is putting a big question mark on Acura products. Quality?"
acura,mdx,2009,Stanley Eilers, 02/27/2015,Worst SUV/auto I have owned,neg,"My experience with a 2009 ACURA MDX with 71,000 miles driven
1.  AC Unit had to be replaced
2.  Struts had to be replaced
3.  AC Control module had to be replaced (illumination led lights on control board did not work)
4.  Control module overhead had to be replaced (illumination lights on control board did not work)
5.  Front wheel bearings had to be replaced
My best advice to anyone buying an ACURA MDX is to buy their platinum extended warranty.  If you have the experiences I have had with this vehicle it will set you back a pretty penny.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Sid Keeny, 06/25/2019,Work horse,pos,"Buy a used one so you don't take the huge hit from massive depreciation.  Does almost everything very well. No car does everything perfect but this one is on par with my Toyota Highlander. I had to move up one big notch so I could tow a boat. My High Lander towed the boat but I feared it was just abusive to continue. The MDX has proven to be reliable and does everything we asked of it. Parts and repairs can be a bit high but the quality is obviously there. I joke and tell people I had to pay 15K just to have one comfortable chair in my life. The acceleration of this SUV is amazing. When you put the petal to the floor it just flies and I have had it well over 100MPH and it never got scary.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Sri, 11/26/2009,Questionable reliability,neu,2009 MDX with less than 4000 miles developed an issue with timing belt and timing belt pulleys. Got it towed to dealer. Dealer told us the front part of engine also got damaged. So they are trying to repair. Filed a complaint with Acura.So far as there was no action from their side as well. I did not pay 46K to get such trouble prone vehicle. People buy acura vehicles because their reliability. It looks like Reliability is getting questionable now.  
acura,mdx,2009,Kristina W., 10/17/2018,Great SUV but some tech issues!!,pos,"Had this suv almost 3 months now. Bought it used with 113,000 miles on it. Luv the car but now seems to be having some technical issues. When driving it sounds like someone is hitting the unlock button for the doors. Got in it this morning and my windows wouldn’t roll down and the sunroof wouldn’t work. After a few mins everything started working again, but same problem when I got back in the car after stopping. Overall a great car for myself having 4 girls.
"
acura,mdx,2009,Jane, 03/10/2019,Best car I've ever owned,pos,"We bought our 2009 MDX base model new and I have enjoyed driving it for the last 9 years! We take it in for regular maintenance, replace the tires when they need to be replaced and generally take good care of it. We have roughly 122,000 miles on it and it's still going strong. We plan to let my daughter drive it once she has her license and we feel great about it's safety on the road. We live in Maine and have lots of snow and ice-- the car handles well in difficult conditions  the standard all weather tires work beautifully. I may well buy another one when I hand over the keys to this one-- or transition to the RDX since I don't have to drive as many kids around anymore! Love this car! Great family vehicle! Very comfortable front seats (I have a back condition and this is very important to me).
"
acura,mdx,2009,acurahappy, 04/08/2010,The Ususal Well Built Honda,pos,"Have owned two Honda's before the MSX, and have been happy with the reliability of both vehicles. Was looking for another SUV, but more upscale from my 94 explorer. All the other stuff out there didn't appeal to me or was too expensive. Since I have had the mdx (sept. 09) I am completely happy with my purchase. The ride is very comfortable and quiet. Has been a pleasure to drive in the city, long trips and in the mountains. The all wheel drive system makes it handle very well on turns of windy roads. My mileage in the city has averaged 18-19 mpg, and up to 25 on the hwy. Impressive for a 300 hp motor. I like the style. Don't mind the ""beak"" in front. It gives it its character. A lot of car for the money.  "
acura,mdx,2009,fishin8tor, 12/01/2009,New and nice,pos,"Only had the car for two weeks, but really like all the features, especially the way this car customizes everything from the drivers seat, ac, and keyless memory system.  Steering is accurate and direct on center, but took some time to get used to as used to drive a Odyssey.  Power is soft at first, but comes on strong when you push it.  Love the transmission and shifter as it is quick on the shifts and doesn't hesitate like other systems.  The SH-AWD is kinda neat, and haven't used it but once in a turn, but it's nice to have and gives great confidence when driving.  Mileage on is 20 on trip to bay area, and city seems around 16.  So far, so good!  I am looking forward to years of driving."
acura,mdx,2009,Myron Yorks, 01/05/2010,What a machine,pos,The MDX is truely a SUV with excellent handling and is fun to drive. I've had the MDX for one month and yet to find anything that requires me to go back to the dealer for. The craftsmanship is something else. I would highly recommend the MDX. I have no regrets with my purchase. My wife and I have driven our new MDX to the coast twice over the past month and it handles so good thru all the twist and turns on highway 1. What a awesome ride. Yet it is still a family SUV. The MDX is the complete package.

"
acura,mdx,2009,Papa Leo, 10/02/2010,Not what I expected from Acura,neg,"13 months into ownership and I have nothing but a trouble with that car. One week into ownership, Air Bag warning came up. It was found that side B-pillar air bag was lose. Another 2 month, car started to pull to the side badly (car had only 3K miles on it), it was found to be misaligned. Another 2 month, gas door wouldn't keep close (replaced under warranty). Another 6 months into ownership and drive side window wouldn't open (window motor bad). My previous '03 Mitsubishi Montero didn't see repair shop for 6 years I owned it (55K miles), only oil changes, tire replacement, and one new set of brakes before drunk driver plunged into me and totaled it. This is my first and the last Acura. "
acura,mdx,2009,Greg, 04/06/2017,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!,neg,"This SUV looks good on the outside, that is about it. I purchased it in September with only 69k miles on it. like 3 months later, I am hearing a whirling noise coming from underneath the vehicle, while driving on the highway. At first, I was thinking it was a wheel bearing. Took it to my mechanic, he said it is not the wheel bearing, could be the Torque Converter. I was thinking perhaps, the propeller shaft and I still think it is the propeller shaft. The engine sounds horrible. My guess are the pulleys. Brand new, this vehicle is 40k, glad I didn't buy brand new. I will be going back to Toyota because Acura (Honda) is very disappointing."
acura,mdx,2009,MG, 10/27/2008,Not that empressive,neu,"All in all I expected much more in the power area and the sound system was a real let down and I have wind noise on driver side and the ride could be nicer I feel all the bumps one the road , right up into the steering wheel. But I have to admit it's beautiful looking. oh ya premium fuel so gas cost are terrible. It does not live up to the reviews it gets (my opinion)."
acura,mdx,2009,tastycakes, 11/30/2009,Best out there in its class [for now],pos,"Buying the MDX felt like an arranged marriage, not true love. For cargo storage, vehicle size, functionality, AWD and price compared to competitors, the MDX is great. But driving...well I don't know who said this is a fun drive.  5-spd tranny feels dated and sluggish to accelerate.  Feel disconnected from the road more so than other CUVs.  Lacks features like keyless entry/ignition, blind spot monitoring.  Leather seems cheap compared to all competitors.  Fuel economy disappointing at 14 mpg (80% highway) after 3 tanks. Lacks small touches in design - example is doors feel light and flimsy when closed.  Chose MDX over CX-9 for the badge but have been feeling regret since purchase."
acura,mdx,2009,Yoshodeep, 02/14/2010,"Overall, a great vehicle",neu,"Having driven the car around town as well as some long trips, I am satisfied with the vehicle. 3rd row seating works fine, albeit not for tall people by any means. Nice pick up. More spacious than I thought from the outside. SH-AWD works great in slick snowy condition. I bought the base pkg, and the sound quality is plenty good. Leather seats are not at par with BMW standards. Bluetooth is somewhat cumbersome (voice recognition only). Can't say enough about the leg and shoulder rooms enough. It is fun to drive, from the SUV perspective. At this price, expected scheduled free maintenance though. Overall one of the best buys in the segment."
acura,mdx,2009,usaheadhunter, 12/20/2009,Acura 2009 MDX Sport AWD,pos,"Purchased after looking at all the rest; BMW, Mercedes, Enclave, Audi, Toyota. Sport package took me over the edge to buy. Handling is fantastic. Seating excellent. Controls easy to use. Cost to own seems relatively strong in Edmunds. We will have to wait and see. After two years, this automobile should have 6 speed transmission. Looks like 2010 will finally have one. When I found out it had build parts in Canada, wanted to turn it back in to the dealer!   "
acura,mdx,2009,Terry Gonsalves, 10/16/2010,Worst I have qwned,neu,Thud/scraping noise from front wheel when driving from cold.Driver side window rattle. Dealer says that these are the characteristics of the vehicle. Acura Canada not responsive.Why is it only a characteristic after you buy the vehicle. Very poor fuel economy. Worst vehicle I have owned. Definitely a do not buy.  
acura,mdx,2009,davidb, 10/23/2008,Buyer's Remorse,neg,"I've bought at least 10 cars over my life and always been 100% satisfied.  For the first time I feel I made a huge mistake.  I've got 1500 miles on a new MDX and I've decided to get rid of the damned thing.  Engine noise reminds me of a 4 cylinder Camry, the transmission is jerky, particularly when downshifting - take your foot off the gas at 60 and the engine immediately starts dragging you down, almost like no overdrive.  The front seats are exhausting if you sit in them over an hour.  And the steering is way too stiff and the indentations on the wheel are spaced too far apart.  I took at least 4 or 5 test drives and for the life of me I don't know how I missed these details."
acura,mdx,2009,Kim, 11/12/2009,JUNKWAGON!,neg,"Well, two transmissions in the first year of ownership should tell you something.  Gas mileage is terrible.  Never got more than 15mpg.  Rattles like it has 100k miles on it.  Dealer stinks and is not very knowledgeable.  First and last Honda product."
acura,mdx,2009,richard, 01/29/2017,Worst car ever purchased!,neg,"We were so disappointed ...... trim pieces broke, sunroof leaked and fried relay circuits, handles for seats broke, leather on drivers seat ripped, and many more.  Certainly others have had these problems because we are gentle folks and maintain the car to a fault.  Where does Acura get these faulty trim pieces?  I forgot to mention rear suspension pieces broke at about 40000 and other front suspension problems.  Never again Acura (or Honda I guess).

Still the worst car ever!
"
acura,mdx,2009,Richie Rich, 08/29/2008,The MDX is simply the Best Crossover,pos,"Simply the best crossover on the road.  I drove the X5, the Mercedes, Infiniti FX and none could compare the right blend of comfort, fun, performance, handling.  Not sure how anyone could even compare the Mazda CX9 to this vehicle.  You can never go wrong with the MDX"
acura,mdx,2009,Ryki, 04/15/2009,Great Bang for the Buck,pos,"This is my 3rd MDX. Great vehicle, reliable, comfortable, quick and fun to drive. Dollar for dollar there is no better SUV on the market today. I have put about 100,000 miles on the 3 MDX's with few if any problems. My only real gripe is that the few problems I have had, have been dealt with poorly. The service departments of the Acura dealers are well below par, in fact they are poor. This is my 4th Acura in 7 years and as much as I love the vehicles, because of the quality of Acura's service, this will probably be my last. Honda get your act together you ain't no Lexus."
acura,mdx,2009,JSC3605, 03/07/2010,Update afetr 6500 miles,pos,"Love the SUV. Just got back from a trip to Pittsburgh. Got over 24 MPG on the highway. This machine is very quite, fast and has lots of room. Great SUV for the money...:)"
acura,mdx,2009,NHHawk6, 12/07/2008,Brilliant design and execution! A joy!,pos,"Test drove everything over a three month period.  Decided on the MDX because of its styling, handling, and technology.  Nothing else in the segment came close. Now that I own it, I enjoy this vehicle far more than I ever imagined possible.  I knew it was a great SUV, but the package in total, leaves you shaking your head at times. It is a precise vehicle, inside and out.  Fit and finish is exceptional.  Performance receives an A++ for a seven passenger vehicle, and it makes you want to drive the long way home everyday.  The luxury, entertainment, and technology features lead you to believe you are already ""home""!  I recommend the Acura MDX Sports and Entertainment edition w/out hesitation!"
acura,mdx,2009,CarNut, 12/06/2008,Best of the Best,pos,"The sales consultant showed me a competitive comparison of the MDX vs GX470, X5, XC90, etc.  It said the MDX was #1 and I didn't believe it so I went and drove all the competitors and I admit I was wrong.   The MDX is the best out there.  Perfect blend of luxury, power safety and reliability.  No buyers remorse here."
acura,mdx,2009,Sean, 12/16/2008,Great handling SUV,pos,"This is one of the best handling SUVs in the market in my opinion.  I test drove several other usual suspects (Lexus RX, BMW X5 etc), and MDX has a nice combination of power, handling, convenience / luxury features at a very competitive price.  When you think about the balance of power, handling, value, reliability, it is hard to beat this SUV.  In 2006, Car and Driver did a comparison test and MDX came out on top.  Also, if you are thinking about getting an MDX for the third row seat, note that the third row seat is best used for kids or smaller adults on a shorter trip as space is very limited.  "
acura,mdx,2009,kurtkbee, 01/04/2009,My 2009 MDX,pos,"I researched this car for over 1 year before purchasing. While I test drove the BMW X5 (3.0) and the Audi Q7 I  always came back to the MDX (Tech/ent). While the other SUVs offered some minor technologies not found in the MDX, those features would have satisfied less than 1% of my needs but when they were configured with all the features of the Tech/Ent MDX the competitors were $8k-$10k more.  The performance of the car is really great and even when taking a bend at a high speed it seemed to handle the road better than my coupe.  The exterior design is very nice and gives the SUV and aggressive look. My wife and I love the SUV but really miss the efficiency that we once had with a sedan"
acura,mdx,2009,gregs, 01/12/2009,Super fun to drive,pos,"- Mazda CX9 was initially my #1 choice - After test driving CX9, I was disappointed with the driving experience (the ride is very shaky) - I tried the MDX, and was blown away by how it handled in the first 5 mins. The experience was silky smooth, yet at the same time aggressive, assertive and very sporty. - The SH AWD is amazing. During the test drive, the dealer encourage me to take sharp highway on-ramps at 60 mpg - I could feel the outer wheels ""pushing"" the car away from the turn - the feeling was totally exhilarating - I kiteboard - the adrenaline rush from the SH AWD (when used aggressively) is comparable to what I feel when on water - I would have never imagined that to be possible"
acura,mdx,2009,JT, 02/02/2009,09 MDX Tech/Ent Review,pos,"Upon owning my MDX for 2 months now, I am in some areas very impressed and in some areas let down a little.  15/20 is the advertised fuel economy.  I have managed as much as 28 MPG cruising at 58 MPH on the interstate.  I have a combined average of 19.8 since new.  On a 2500 mile trip I got 23.0.  Very impressive.  Downs - black interior trim swirls and scratches like crazy.  Leather seating looks like it's been sat in for 10 years already.  It sags and has permanent indentions.  I use Meguiars Leather cleaner/conditioner and it makes them look clean and shiny, but leather still looks worn beyond actual life.  Car is strong as heck, does what I want it to, but seats and trim are questions.  "
acura,mdx,2009,msam, 02/16/2009,SH SUV,pos,"Even though I loved the features of the MDX, I was originally not planning on getting a premium SUV and my preference was the Mazda CX9.  I got to test drive both the vehicles in the snow on the same day.  I was blown away by the MDX handling in the snow.  Compared to the CX9, it was miles ahead.  I bought it the same day and have not looked back. I love the features that come standard with the MDX.  The SH-AWD system performs great in cornering and I don't have to worry about hitting patches of ice/water.  The MDX slows down a bit more than you would expect when removing your leg off the accelerator, which took me a bit getting used to. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
acura,mdx,2009,JAnn, 02/27/2009,"Nice, but has some flaws",pos,"I love driving my MDX. The base model has everything you really need, it includes a lot of upgrades that you pay for in other cars. The negatives: Low quality leather, it wears bad. The black plastic trim would be better replaced with wood trim, for a $40,000 vehicle that shouldn't even be a question. I notice a lot of road noise in the cabin. Also, I have the worst time getting my hands free link to recognize certain numbers. Sometimes I will have to say the number 4 like 5 times before it will actually dial the correct number. That is VERY frustrating. Also, for a $40,000 vehicle, it should have an automatic liftgate. This car does have excellent road handling, overall I am happy!"
acura,mdx,2009,AcuraMDX09, 03/11/2009,"Fun to drive, joy to own",pos,"I tried to convince myself to buy a German SUV. I test drove the X5 (3.0), Audi Q7, and the ML 350. In my opinion none of the German cars come close to touching the MDX in handling, comfort and space. Material could be a touch better in the MDX (the black fiberglass trim looks cheap for example). But there is no way I could justify 8-10K more for any of the German cars. And don't get me started on the RX350 or the CX9. "
acura,mdx,2009,rams, 04/20/2009,Transmission problem at 400 miles,neg,"Bought my MDX 4 months back. After 2 months transmission fluid started leaking, noticed oil marks on my garage floor. Took to dealer - they had to open the whole transmission and check inside. The problem was a faulty ""O"" ring which was causing the leak. If a $20 part is faulty after 400 miles not sure what to expect from this SUV. The dealer had to remove the whole transmission, unlink it with the engine, opened up everything connected to the engine to get to the faulty O ring. Don't buy this car, for this price there are much better options in the market. I have Lexus SUV as well and it far exceeds Acura from performance and reliability."
acura,mdx,2009,sunsky, 04/28/2009,Best car ever,pos,This is the best car ever. 
acura,mdx,2009,schooldoc, 04/29/2009,Better than expected gas mileage,pos,"I read these review before I buy so that's why I'm doing this. My first SUV, typically German sports cars. 11,000 miles no problems, gas mileage computer at 65 mph freeway 25-26 mpg, if I were to drive at 80 it would drop to 20-21, so I'm happy. Love sport suspension, in an emergency quick manuever suspension tightened up and I avoided an accident, fun too. Sequoia mtns. Snow was fun an safe handling, lots of power, remember im used to BMW's and Porsche's, no longer trust Mercedes. Surprised I enjoy the elec. Tail gate, love the taupe interior, nav screen big, blu tooth wonderful, computer info good, x-lights great cockpit comfort, luv the front grill etc. Looking to buy another in 2 years."
acura,mdx,2009,shooterj, 05/06/2009,Nice ride...,pos,"Switched from RX400H to MDX due to the need for more room to haul rugrats. :) Test drove X5, Fx35/50, and GX470, somehow overall MDX gave me the best combo scores in handling, performance, luxury amenities, and reliability... not to mention the safety rating on this 300 HP beast... "
acura,mdx,2009,amital, 05/08/2009,Disappointing,neu,"Save your money folks -lot better stuff out there for the price. Have owned new MDX for about a year.  Maintenance costs are VERY high. Differential fluid changes every 15,000 miles - not kidding. It's based on the service code.  Dealers are all old school and in terrible condition. Have been to 3 different ones and they're all unprofessional -- and crooks to boot!  Today I took the MDX in and apparently the brakes went out at 25000 miles. Fog/DTL light cover had melted from heat and they told me the exhaust from someone backing up real close must have done it -- unbelievable!  Acura cust svc is just as bad.  I have a Lexus too-the service experience and reliability is in a whole diff. league."
acura,mdx,2009,IN46321, 05/10/2009,Safe and solid performer,pos,"Love my MDX. Solid build quality and fit n finish. Did a apples to apples comparison with the Lexus RX 350. Hands down the MDX is much better value. The smoothness of the ride and the technology package is just incredible. My 2 kids(8 & 6) are having a ball. Bluetooth and phone book downloads are so convenient. The navigation system with lane assist, traffic updates and other advanced features like Zagat rocks! Xm is a nice icing on the cake..Can't stop looking at it and driving it. Plunge in and pamper yourself. You live only once.."
acura,mdx,2009,J. Isman, 06/01/2009,Great 3-row SUV,pos,"For comfort and luxury it can't be beaten....design is sharp, esp. front grill and badge....wish the city gas mileage were a bit better...not bad tho' on the highway..."
acura,mdx,2009,ljndsl , 06/02/2009,So Far So GOOD!,pos,"Picked up this vehicle one month ago and so far logged 3200 miles without any problems. The vehicle runs great and is very comfortable for a guy who is 6'5"" tall and 280lbs. I researched all AWD high end vehicles and went with the MDX. I had the car in for service at the dealership I purchased it and they were fantastic and extremely professional, so maybe Honda has listened and read all the consumer complaints. Last, I own a BMW X3 also... this SUV smokes the X3 in regards to service maintenance. A BMW oil change is 250.00 plus... a Acura oil change is 39.00 with a free car wash! "
acura,mdx,2009,Dave, 06/20/2009,Pretty good,neu,"Nice car. Build quality is excellent. Dealer service has been excellent. Bluetooth cell phone pairing is easy and nice.  Seats are hard for me to set up comfortably though and the headrests are absolutely awful. Very uncomfortable due b/c they tilt too far forward.  Dash has too many buttons. Acura should consolidate the controls to make them easier to use, rather than trying to make you depend on voice input. GPS requires far too many steps.   No iPod integration is disappointing. Needs better, more durable clear coat on the paint.  Rear camera display hangs switching modes (dark to light) backing out of a driveway so often is useless when needed most on a sunny day."
acura,mdx,2009,JW, 06/30/2009,Not too shabby!,pos,Owned it for only a few days and really enjoy driving it. Panel controls are complicated but not impossible. Will see about reliability later...
acura,mdx,2009,Ralph, 07/22/2009,"Nice SUV, Could Be Better",pos,"I am very impressed with the handling and many electronic features of the MDX, but I am somewhat disappointed in some of the interior fit & finish, harshness/loudness of the engine, audio quality, complexity of the navigation system, and the dealer add-ons that should be standard in a $40K+ vehicle."
acura,mdx,2009,Dmitriy, 07/24/2009,Solid SUV,pos,"This is a very well-built SUV. Great interior, audio, engine, transmission. Exterior design will be updated, no doubt. Fuel-economy is a really big down side. Otherwise, better-priced then BMW and Audi. Way better, than Mazda and American-made SUVs."
acura,mdx,2009,Buster, 07/29/2009,Best in class,neu,"Driven my Sport/Ent MDX for 12000 miles now.  The drive-ability of this SUV is impeccable.  As in other reviews, I'm not sure it has 300HP, but it is enough. The smooth and quiet ride is why I bought it.  Stereo is good, but not earth shattering.  Nav is good, but has too many 'warning' prompts.  Can program on the fly, unlike others.  I really like driving at night and the headlights are great.  Have had one problem with compliance bushings, but dealership is very accommodating with loaners.  I don't like the key fob and think this league auto should have keyless options.  Not sure about the transmission, which is designed to help you brake, is all that comfortable, but it is sporty and smooth."
acura,mdx,2009,MDXer, 08/06/2009,Six Weeks,pos,"I've had my Tech Package MDX for about 6 weeks now.  I love it.  This is an amazing vehicle.  Comfort, power, handling, technology and the sound system is amazing.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone shopping in the luxury SUV market."
acura,mdx,2009,Marisol Wesson, 07/29/2009,Disappointment!,neu,"I am a complete Acura fan. I have owned 3 Acura cars (all TLs) and now my great MDX.  I fell in love with the MDX, its performance and reliability.. Feel safe and excited driving the MDX.  However, for some reason, and for the first time, I've had several electrical issues. First, the CD player got stuck and it had to be replaced.  Now, the electronics on the seats do not work, the memory is gone. The Bluetooth for my phone sometimes works but most of the time, I have to take my calls from the cell phone directly as the calls do not get through.  After paying so much money for this MDX, it is disappointing to be having so many problems. Yes, Acura dealer will correct all these problems."
acura,mdx,2009,2009MDXFAN, 08/09/2009,Best SUV in its class,neu,The 2009 MDX is a good mix of luxury and performance.  Interior styling is visually pleasant but Acura should not have skimped on quality of material such as the plastic interior handles and plastic fake wood.  The strengths of the MDX is definitely the handling quality compared to other SUVs.
acura,mdx,2009,1st MDXbuyer, 08/20/2009,Not a bad one,neu,"Got it a month ago after thorough study and many colleagues bought MDX previously. Overall it is a nice SUV and worth with its price. Good handling and smooth drive although steering wheel is too restrained to turn. For exterior I like front design, but tail looks terrible. Power is good, especially like the manumatic shift to satisfy sporty drivers. A typical sport SUV."
acura,mdx,2009,Mibrego, 08/24/2009,A True Luxury SUV,pos,"Now over the initial new- vehicle ""crush,"" I'm still very impressed with what this car is capable of.  Lives up to the designation ""luxury-performance SUV.""  I have subjected this vehicle to all kinds of conditions: towing a 4000 lb camper through 60-mile per hour gusts, plowing through white-outs on snow- covered roads in the Sierras, carrying three kayaks over dirt roads and sandy beaches.  In all these adverse conditions, this vehicle kept its cool and did its job with grace, power, and control.  It kept my family of five comfortable and safe with its arsenal of super-handling features. All of this, for a good $3000 below that of competitors with comparable features.  You do the math."
acura,mdx,2009,zisimom, 08/29/2009,Awesome SUV with good gas mileage,pos,"This is my 3rd Acura and 6th Honda product and I love it. I live in Washington, DC and with almost 100% city driving I am getting 19.5 mpg overall. That is awesome city mileage for a full-size, comfortable 3 row SUV. It is comfortable, easy for the kids and very intuitive. The entertainment system can be ""driven"" 100% by the back seat passenger (in my case a 10 year old) which leaves me free to listen to satellite radio. Holds everything I need it to. One big feature for me, even with the 3rd row up there's enough room in the rear for kids school backpacks, some sports gear or groceries. The SH-AWD satisfies even my BMW loving husband who drives a 2009 535xi. He was pleasantly surprised."
acura,mdx,2009,No1UKnow, 09/29/2009,Great choice for our family,pos,"After 6000 miles this summer, I'm extremely pleased with our MDX.  I really wanted a station wagon with a 3rd row seat and this was our best option.  Great leg room for the kids in the second row and I've ridden in the 3rd row.  Love the NAV.  Easy to use.  Bluetooth actually understands me!  Love how stable and responsive the car is.  Plenty of power when I need it on the highway.  Tons of cargo space.  Even with every seat in use, plenty of room for backpacks behind the 3rd row.  Didn't want a minivan and I feel like we've finally found the perfect family car.  I often take 300 mile+ trips by myself with the kids and I feel very safe in the car.  I occasionally let my husband drive!"
acura,mdx,2009,Will, 10/06/2009,Solid SUV,pos,"We bought our first MDX in Dec 08. 5400 miles later, my wife was T-Boned on the drivers side at a major intersection. The front/side airbags deployed and there was some $20K in damage. I must say I was impressed to the way the vehicle took the direct hit, thus protecting my wife from any serious injury. The other vehicle was totaled. Based on the location, and speed of the vehicle that hit our MDX, this little thing really took it well. We got it fixed and bought another one. They may be pricey, but they sure are safe and dependable."
acura,mdx,2009,bayarea, 10/21/2009,Extremely happy with my purchase,pos,"I've had my car for a week, so I can't really comment on the reliability.  I'll update it later.  I originally went out looking to buy a Toyota Highlander, thinking that was the only SUV that was in my price range, but the deals on the MDX have been crazy so I could easily justify the $5 more I spent on the MDX.  This car has everything I wanted.  The SH-AWD is awesome, the luxurious interior is really comfortable and has a ton of features and tech (I got the tech package).  The voice recognition is way better than my BMW I used to have and it drives much more like a sports car than the RX.   I ordered all my accessories off of bernardi acura for way cheaper."
acura,mdx,2009,jenny , 10/19/2009,Acura MDX Tech. Package w/DVD on Headsets,pos,"Our brand-new MDX was broken into and the window was destroyed and two DVD players on the headrest were cut and stolen after within one hour of purchase. We think the DVD headrest design was inferior, and can not be pulled out at all and no accessory to cover the two DVD sets. We think this is fail design and vulnerable to be stolen."
acura,mdx,2009,BRV, 10/26/2009,2500 hundred miles - so far so good,pos,"I have logged just under 2,500 hundred miles since August.  W/tech pkg I paid 40k + tax & title.  Vehicle handles well on dry and wet roads (no snow in our area yet). It is fairly quiet and very comfortable.  Overall great vehicle and best value in the ""upscale"" SUV class. Beats others in its class for the same money.  EPA 15/20. I'm getting 20 to 21 overall in mostly country driving where I live and commute to work.  Best feature: performance/handling/comfort combination  Worst feature: roof rack wind noise. I removed the cross bars and will just put them back on when needed. Very easy to just unscrew 2 screws per bar. Takes 5 minutes."
acura,mdx,2009,JRS-CSC, 12/04/2009,One of the best SUV's on the market,pos,"I love my MDX!!!! I do not know what SUV the other folks are driving, but my experience has been great. The MDX handles like a dream. The stereo is one of the best I have ever heard and I have had no issues to date. The only bad thing is that I am only getting around 18 miles to the gallon on average, 22 highway. The sport package has some of the best looking wheels and a nice leather upgrade. I love my MDX... "
acura,mdx,2009,cegledi, 12/06/2009,First Time Acura Owner,pos,"I'm excited to finally own an Acura. It's my first glimpse into the luxury world and am not a least bit disappointed. Wish they beefed up the standard features (back-up sensors, power tail, USB cable, etc.). However, I think the overall value and the performance of that sweet V6 makes me not care about much of the other stuff. So far, so good. Life is good."
acura,mdx,2009,MS, 04/26/2010,solid car,pos,"great all-around mid-sise SUV.  Exterior styling wears well, looks striking in black, with the red/brick leather. amazing sound system, has to be heard to be believed. As an enthusiast, amazed at how well the car responds when pushed hard.  Car seems to prefer being pushed hard rather than cruising.  Can at least chase my brother in his STI. Ride is a bit firm on long trips, active damping with a comfort mode needs to be standard.  Needs better quality interior materials and leather.  Simplified button arrangement on dash. Car is very sporty, maybe adding Brembos, and 50bhp would fulfill its potential."
acura,mdx,2009,MDXMAN, 05/01/2010,Great SUV,pos,"I love my MDX.  I have a black MDX w/technology package.  I opted for the roof rails and sport side steps. It is a beautiful SUV.  It has a great ride, ample storage, terrific acceleration and handles like a sports sedan.  I was considering the Audi, but the Audi's handling does not even come close to the Acura.  The BMW handled well but was now where near as luxurious or comfortable.  MPG are quite reasonable considering the performance of the engine.  I've had the vehicle for 9 months now and have had zero maintenance issues.  If you're looking for a fantastic luxury SUV, look no further."

However this Advance model has the best Navigation on the market as well as the Adaptive Cruise Control, Blind Spot Indicators and the Collision Warning system. Took a 4,000 mile trip recently, got 23 MPG, and enjoyed effortless interstate driving assisted by the Adaptive Cruise control.  In multiple lane Big City traffic, the side radar (Blind Spot Indicators) are priceless from a safety aspect.

For newer models there has JUST been a recall, within the last month. New software needs to be installed by the dealer. Be sure to ask if this recall applies to your car. 
My TC was replaced two months ago in my 2010 vehicle. I find it interesting that only now has Acura accepted the fact that a general problem has existed across many years of the MDX production. This damages my long-time positive feelings about Acura automobiles."
acura,mdx,2010,JJ10, 10/06/2010,Good Value and Lots of Gadgets,neu,"Have had the car for a month and overall quite happy with it. It is the best value for the money in this size/category. The tech pkg has tons of features, though some are more gimmicky than useful. Not crazy about the exterior, but interior is roomy and comfortable. Cargo area is smaller than I'd like. Performance is ok. The engine lacks torque and has to rev hard for power (while making a lot of noise). Coming from a European SUV, I feel the suspension is too soft and steering is way too loose. The torque vectoring is a bit unpredictable when cornering. Road noise is surprisingly high. The car had a couple of small issues upon delivery, which is disappointing for a Honda product."
acura,mdx,2010,BMart, 08/18/2015,This Car Eats Oil,neu,"This engine is a oil eater.  I got the car used form the dealer with a fresh oil change - at 4k miles later the check engine light comes on - I check the oil and it does not even register on the dip stick.   I thought OK -it was not a Acura/Honda dealer I got it from (Mercedes) so they put the wrong oil in or something.   I made sure it had synthetic the next time.   Same thing happens.  The other problem is Acura has set the maintenance interval to 7500 miles - way to long for this oil eater.  I recommend 3k miles for sure and check the oil every 1k miles.   The bummer is my old cars have oil that looks fine after 5k miles but this car just chews it up.  I now make sure I have quarts of synthetic available,  and I went and bought a funnel to add oil to this car every 1k miles.  I have to treat it like a vintage automobile.

Other than that it runs fine - it has a solid feel that reminds me of a BMW.

acura,mdx,2010,er405, 02/25/2011,Transmission Cycling will cause performance delays,neg,"I traded my new 2010 MDX after months of working with Acura Client Services and the Dealer. 

The MDX's progressive transmission, in my opinion, is poorly designed. Although, the driver is pressing the gas pedal, the MDX will have long delays during gear cycles. 

This could be dangerous if attempting to make a quck turn in on-coming traffic. You want to go, but the MDX moves very slowly or not at all.

Second, the cabin lets in so much air that during the winter, the heat must be set to keep the cabin warm, especially at the feet.

Last, the MDX looses lots of horsepower as it cycles through the gears. A sluggish ride at best. 

For the money, find something else. "
acura,mdx,2010,tp12string, 07/30/2011,The Best SUV Period!,pos,"After much research and test drives I selected the MDX. I test drove the X5, Q7, and Grand Cherokee as well as the Mazda CX9 and others. The MDX was overall the better choice....and less expensive than many of the others. After owning it for almost a year and 30K miles I can say that it has met and exceeded my expectations. It is very comfortable; the technology is easy to use and intuitive; the navigation is the best I've seen anywhere. If you are considering an SUV, do yourself a big favor and test drive the MDX. Best vehicle I've ever owned, and I've owned many new cars over the years."
acura,mdx,2010,28if, 06/26/2014,Transmission harness didn't even make 75K miles,neu,"In the shop again for another transmission non warranty covered issue. This time the ""D"" indicator light starts blinking, no error codes. Dealer says the wiring harness between the engine and tranny needs to be replaced for $2K!!!. No the power train warranty doesn't cover this. Car has just under 75,000 miles on it. Really? The quality is so bad that basic parts can't last 75,000 miles. Putting it on Craigs list
as soon as I get it back.

acura,mdx,2010,CR1970, 10/08/2010,Impressive,pos,"I purchased one of the last 2010 Advance/Entertainment MX's that the dealer had on the lot and couldn't be happier.  We test drove a number of SUV's including the new RX, Highlander, and BMW.  The vehicle handles so much better than the RX and just seems to have a good balance of sport and comfort. I love the selectable ride option as well as the blind spot warning indicators.  The stereo system is AMAZING and light years ahead of my RX.  Voice recognition and navigation system were much better than the BMW we looked at.  The new 6 speed transmission shifts smoothly and pickup is impressive for a vehicle of it's size.  Fit and Finish is also impressive."
acura,mdx,2010,John Ta, 07/10/2016,Transmission failed at 45000 miles,neg,"I am the original owner and bought it in April 2010.  The car was awesome to drive at beginning.  It had pulling issue and grinding noise at low speed when turning the car right after leaving dealer.  Both these issues got TSB from Acura later on.  The grinding noise was not fixed since TSB came after warranty expired.  After 2 years,  the MPG went bad from 1 tank for 300 miles down to 200 miles locally and we need to down shift to passed another car.  At 45000 miles or 5 1/2 years, the transmission failed.  MPG went back to 300 miles for 1 tank of gas but the transmission is shifting so slow now.  I bought it since I love it's performance and handling.  My next SUV will be Lexus RX 350 since I bought lexus gs 350 and it changed me.  I have been honda acura brand fan for 15 years and it is over  now except Formula 1 Honda LoL
"
acura,mdx,2010,SW, 06/16/2019,Too many issues with my 2010 tech (disappointed),neg,"I bought the car brand new in 2010. Had many issues over the past 9yrs. A year after buying it, I took it to the dealer more than 3 times and complain about exhaust smell coming in the cabin and no one ever fix it. At times they won’t document it. They just call one of their mechanic  and he sprays freshener in my air vents and give me back the car saying that’s normal because the catalytic converter burning rich and it’s normal. I found a body plug fell off next to exhaust inner fender and once I replaced it it’s fine. About 5yrs later the roof seam between the tailgate cracked and water coming in the car when it rains. Dealer told me that’s body shop work and car is out of warranty so they didn’t fix it. I fix myself with silicone. The paint on the 2 front fender next to the hood flaking off on the edge and the lift gate paint flaking off above the Acura emblem about 3 inches diameter. The dealer said again that’s body shop to fix and car out of warranty so I had to fix it myself. My engine making a rattling sound when accelerating and the dealer said my tension pulley needs to be replaced. After paying $300 to replace it, it still rattles. Took it back they told me it’s a fuel. They said I cannot use premium gas from QT, Costco or sams club and I must buy from chevron or shell. What the heck??? After taking the car for a few times for maintenance I told one of the service advisor and he said I need a software update so the charge 1/2 hour labor. The transmission jutters a lot and the dealer say it’s normal. They want me to do a flush every 15k miles. What? The rpm gauge needle moves up and down between 1500 and 2000rpm when driving at 45mpg or 65mpg. Anyway, I did a flush and problem still there. I loose power to my sunroof and windows. Of course I had to fix it myself because it was out of warranty. Was a bad wire harness on the drivers door. All 4 of my shock absorbers went out. I don’t drive my MDX long distance, no bad roads, most of time I park in garage, don’t drive like crazy, etc. My oil level always low when checking it with the dip stick and the dealer says it’s normal. Don’t waste your money on this car. I wish Acura can read this and either buy my car back or cut me a check for the $4000 or so I sent in repairs. I don’t think I will ever invest in another Acura since I am loosing faith in their quality and workmanship. I owned 3 Acuras and my MDX was problematic. Of course I fixed everything except the rpm moving up and down and the transmission still jitters. Avoid getting a 2007 thru 2013. All these years have almost the same problem. Look it up on google or YouTube.
"
acura,mdx,2010,Pissed Acura Owner, 08/14/2019,Buyer Beware! Oil Burner!,neg,"I have a 2010 MDX base model and have owned since brand new. The MDX now has about 103,000 miles. I purchased this car due to its reputation for reliability, dependability, and longevity. 

In February of 2019 I got a letter in the mail from Acura explaining that there’s an issue with some 3.7L engines burning oil.  

After driving between 4000 and 4500 miles prior to back to back oil changes, the engine was bone dry with no oil on the dipstick. 

Prior to the latter oil change, the oil light came on and I notified the dealer considering the maintenance minder indicated about 30% life on the oil. 

I was advised to check the oil and if need be add oil. I did so adding about 3 quarts and the level still did not show on the dipstick. 

So a few days later I go into the dealer to complain and I begin the oil consumption test. After 1500 miles I was told my engine burned a half a quart and that Acura may not fix the issue since it’s not burning over 1 quart in a 1000 miles. 

I am pissed! Engines aren’t supposed to burn oil! Acura claims this is normal! BS! 

I may be buying a Lexus or 4Runner!

Honda/Acura has gone down in quality and are now on par with American manufacturers!

acura,mdx,2010,Mike, 06/19/2020,Great vehicle for the price,pos,"Hello, I purchased the 2010 MDX in June 2020. So far its a great SUV, lots of room, third row, seats fold flat, lots of tech goodies, sound system is really good. AWD seems to be more of a standard item with SUV's so I am glad the MDX is equipped with it. The middle row seats are surprisingly comfortable, if you haven't sat in them - try it out. We all accept that the third row seats are small - good for kiddos, not too much else. I like that the A/C system is linked in with the Nav so it knows when a passenger has the sun on them and will cool their side down more...neat feature.

Cons - As others have mentioned, not well insulated from highway noise, fuel mileage is so so (but it has decent power for the 3.7 v6). Timing belt will need to be replaced every 100K km's which does not appear to be a major job. The back quarter panel by the rear wheels seem to be somewhat prone to rust, take care of yours if it has avoided corrosion so far. Headlights have the same issues as all plastic headlights nowadays - they oxidize over time (can polish or wet sand out, just remember to use a good sealer after the job). Also, I am 6'1 and notice that it's quite a step out of the vehicle from a seated position, it's not a problem for me, but shorter folks may see this as a bit of an issue. 

All in all the vehicle seems to be well made and relatively easy to maintain. I hope it's a keeper!!

Update - 19 Dec 2020: Still a great vehicle, the only issue was with the spare tire hoist mechanism. When I added a trailer hitch, I discovered the problem, part was about $170 at the dealer, very easy to install. Very pleased with the amount of power the vehicle has, but again the fuel mileage is not superb. Put 10k km on since the last review and have had no other issues. 
"
acura,mdx,2010,steve, 09/24/2010,Not so happy,neu,Have had 4-MDX's. The 10 model is the worse. Second row seats don't fold flat unless the second row headrests are removed. When removed there is no place to store them. More squecks and rattles than other 3 MDX's. Milage is not good for having a 6-speed trans. Recommended is 91 octane fuel. If use less the engine gives a fluttering noise. Dealer says tht is normal. This did not happened in any of my other 3 MDX's. Overall not happy with vehicle. Will look elsewhere when purchasing replacement vehicle.
acura,mdx,2010,jccai1, 08/10/2012,Not Impressed,neu,"Replaced a Volvo XC90 with the MDX in 2010. We were sold mostly on interior space, price (model year end) and perceived reliability. Two years later, I have to say I'm not impressed.

The car is just a chore to drive. The engine has very little low end torque. The ride is busy and floaty at the same time. The steering is loose and vague on center. A lot of road noise makes it into the cabin. And the transmission has slow and sloppy shifts, even after the software upgrade. After reading the horror stories about failed torque converters, now I'm really worried. Since it's the new 6-speed, I had thought Honda had fixed their transmission issues. I guess I was wrong!"
acura,mdx,2010,Vincent, 02/26/2010,So many problems already,neu,"I have owned 5 Acura and Honda products in the past (2 Acuras and 3 Hondas). All of them have been pretty much ""bulletproof"" in quality and reliability. This one has been a terrible disappointment! Where do I start? My MDX has been in the shop 3 times already in just 4700 miles! The transmission jerks erratically. The ELS sound system was fixed under warranty, and the vehicle pulls strongly to the right (Alignment has not fixed the issue)."
acura,mdx,2010,hamish, 03/28/2010,So much better than the 06 MDX,pos,"Have had my 10 base MDX for all of two days now. Biggest difference vs. the 06 MDX is that you actually look forward to driving this one! Reminds me of my 03 TLS, fun to drive, responds well, too fast for the kids to drive on their own!! Handling is very good, sticks to the road like an audi quattro, sporty handling, very little body roll for an SUV. Also very good for tall folk, my 6 ft 4 son, finds it very comfortable as both a passenger and driver. "
acura,mdx,2010,carollyn, 05/28/2012,MDX transmission issues,neu,"My husband and I have a 2010 MDX and it's been in the service dept almost 5 times with serious issues. two of those being transmission problems.

It had to have a torque converter with less than 30K miles.
It recently needed another tranny software update.
Steering and axle issues......Wow.
For 50K purchase, we shouldn't have these problems!!!

I feel like we need to get RID of this car while it still has a decent resale value.
DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT!! BUY ONE OF THESE CARS!
 It's been nothing but a headache for us.
 We are trading it in tomorrow.
 Will never buy an acura or honda AGAIN!!!
 EVER!!!!"

Normal size from outside; excellent finish, pointy front grill; very spacious from inside; love all the advance features; adaptive cruise is really good. Traveled to Florida total 1600 miles no issues with comfort or reliability; unlike the space shuttle. The blind spot indicator is excellent as is the comfort setting of the ride. On returning home 1 foot of snow and the vehicle got stuck in it. Called Acura 800 number was told to call back after 2 hours if condition was same; no immediate help available.

I wanted a Sport/Entertainment at the time, but they were very hard to find. The first '10 MDX my dealer had was an Advance/Ent. and after driving it I had to have it. The '08 was great, but the '10 is even better. It looks more aggressive, the LED lighting is much nicer, and the extra gear is a nice upgrade."

It is also not a car for the technology-challenged individual. It is packed with so much stuff, including adaptive speed control, blind side sensors, heated and cooled front seats, bluetooth, you name it. I don't get the issue with too many buttons. The dash is well laid out. Awesome suspension. And tight corners it does very well, with sport suspension turned on. I was taking corners like I was in a tl. Ok, not quite as fast, but unbelievable for a 2 ton SUV. "

acura,mdx,2010,Timothy Hart, 11/07/2018,Acura MDX provides excellent/reliable performance,pos,"I read about how good the MDX was and switched from an Escalade to the MDX.  It has been a completely reliable vehicle without a single visit to the dealer for problems.  My car looks the same as when I first drove it home.  The interior and exterior have held up perfectly.  The car drives the same as when I first purchased it.  It is roomy and when I need to bring a large load home, it does a good job.  The car drives well on ice or snow.  It has always been very comfortable and reliable.  I would strongly recommend this car.

acura,mdx,2010,curious52, 11/13/2011,Torque converter issue,pos,"There is some concern about torque converters in older MDX vehicles, but now this goes forward to the 2010 model. At about 35,000 miles, my vehciles began to hesitate and shudder when it was necessary for the transmission to change gears. I read some Twitter reports which gave me reason to take my car to the dealer. They road tested the car and agreed the torque converter needed to be replaced, covered by the warrenty. They also told me they had replaced converters on four other 2010 MDX vehicles. The job takes about two days as the transmission must be lowered to replace the part. There is noticable difference now. My dealer was excellent in how they handled the matter."
acura,mdx,2010,Richie Rich, 05/29/2010,Simply the best SUV,pos,Purchase my 2010 MDX Tech/Ent and without any doubt is the best handling SUV on the market.  The new auto shift is smooth and makes the vehicle that much more responsive. The 2010s are much more quiet and upgrades to the technology is amazing.  The stereo motivates you to drive more and  the seats and active restraints are so much more comfortable.  Stunning SUV.

At first I didn't like it, but once I drove it alone and realized how fast this car is, I dig it! The v6 sounds awesome under heavy throttle and the car takes off! The SH-AWD is great in the snow, and the car handles like a dream. Stereo sounds great. Leather seats are very comfortable. Sport mode with the paddle shifters is a lot of fun, almost like a real manual. Now for the not-so-good.. We had to have a new transmission put in at 25k miles. Acura did it for free, but just be warned.after they fixed it we love the car!"
acura,mdx,2010,John McGreevy, 02/28/2016,Love it,pos,"This is definitely a great SUV with superior handling.  The only knock is the poor gas mileage.  8/2018 Update (92K miles)--> one other issue (non critical) I have now is that the car burns oil very quickly.  For example, if I'm 2800 miles post oil change and the oil life reading in the car says 50%, the 'Low Engine Oil' warning indicator comes on.  It's not a faulty sensor either.  The car is actually down 2 quarts of oil after this time.  3/2020 Update (118K miles) -->  Turns out the low engine oil warning and the burning of oil fell under a Honda / Acura recall a year ago.  That was resolved by new pistons replaced free of charge.  I've also had several sensors go bad in the last year (tire pressure and one other).  Overall, the car is still in great shape and drives well.  I'm looking forward to gifting this car to my oldest when she's done with college in 2 years.

acura,mdx,2010,Discerning, 01/08/2010,Top of the Line,pos,"Switched from BMW X3 for more cargo room but did not want to give up handling. This one handles like a vehicle much smaller than it is and it has lots more bells and whistles than the BMW. It's hard to beat the way a BMW handles but this one is close, especially for its size. Great comfort and conveniences. Plenty of pep and a smooth ride. Exceptional technology. Perhaps the best luxury SUV value in the market."

I tried but nothing else compares in this class. This suv drives like a sports car, it the right size and is very luxurious.

On several occasions I have hauled cargo that the car should have been able to easily handle, approximately 300 - 400 lbs.
However, that was not the case, both times the car wondered all over the road, behaving like it was overaloded, definately not what I expected. "
acura,mdx,2010,JG, 01/27/2010,Acura MDX- Value over Price,pos,"We switched from a Tahoe and looked at an Enclave, X5, Q7, GX460, GL and the MDX gave the best value for the price compared against the others.  Smooth acceleration, superior navigation system and great sound system and features.  We lost some room but got some gas mileage efficiency and this car has got the goods to keep us happy for some time.  6th gear added this year to transmission which make rider smoother and more gas efficient.   Upgraded HDD, LED interior lights which add additional style touches.  AWD is amazing and truly a safety feature for those that are concerned about driving in bad weather.  Truly this car provides tremendous Value for Price and we are picky folks."

Got new one for $41,903 - way below the TMV. Really happy about that. Thats only about $5K more than we paid 8 years ago for the 2002 Base model that can't compare with the new technology. Love the interior and wonderful stereo/NAV/HDD system., but all the buttons & various owner manuals are a little intimidating. The ride is similar to the 2002 in terms of feel and ride quality, so not a real cushy ride, has some road noise, but also a sporty feel like all Acuras.

acura,mdx,2010,Sleepysam22, 02/14/2010,Nice looking SUV,pos,I have owned several MDX'S and the 2010 Advance package is by far the best. The 6 speed trans is smooth and responsive. The navigation with hdd is the best I have seen from any manufacture and I have looked at them all as I am a big time nav/tech guy.

I have never been so satisfied with a car. The combination of comfort, space, performance, safety and reliability is great. I wasn't willing to compromise on any of those features and the MDX was the only one that met all of my criteria. The safety ratings really sold me due to the fact that I have a teen driver learning on this car and another one coming up in 2 years. Decent fuel economy given the size of the MDX."

I looked at: BMW X5(way overpriced - smaller then MDX) AUDI Q7(Overpriced - did not enjoy the ride) Buick Enclave(GM quality is not so good after years of use and I plan to keep this car for 10 years)  I chose the MDX because the price was right. Another reviewer said that they dealer would not lower the MSRP. HA. I say that person has no negotiation skills. I got mine for $41, 700, a few hundred below invoice and over $4000 off MSRP. ($47,400 out the door). 1.9% APR is great too. Buy at end of the month!  "
acura,mdx,2010,Joe Dimitrius, 04/26/2010,2010 MDX Tech,pos,"Bought the 10 MDX Tech a month ago. Looks great in black. Love the ride. Compared against the Q5 (smaller), Q7( much more expensive), Lexus RX (very girly) and the X5 (more expensive to own). Zeroed in on the MDX. 45 out of the door. Yes, wait till the end of the month."
acura,mdx,2010,Brian, 04/29/2010,Enjoying the MDX Experience,pos,"I have put some miles in the drivers seat and find the MDX is what I was after in comfort, styling, performance and safety. I typically drive distance spending hours at a time on roads in different states. The MDX seems to glide on smooth surfaces with little sound or feel from the road. However on rough roads, I notice wheel noise. I am impressed with little sound from the outside entering in the cab. I forget what other vehicles sound like as they rush by in this car.  I enjoy the sound systems as do my boys with thier IPODs. The cornering and handeling of the MDX gives me confidence that I can quickly manuever when needed especially in rain. "
acura,mdx,2010,Hilbilly 385, 05/03/2010,A solid value,pos,After a month or two  of ownership we are quite pleased with our MDX. Build quality and features are excellent. It has a quiet ride and feels stable at 80mph. The seats are comfortable and the Navi/audio system are excellent. While not a sports car it handles very well and gets up to speed nicely. It has an excellent balance of exterior size and interior capacity. Recommend highly.
acura,mdx,2010,Dr. T., 05/04/2010,2010 MDX even better than the 2007.,pos,This is my third MDX.  It is even better than my beloved 2007 MDX.  Much better sound system and much better backup camera.  This is the SUV for those of us who love the performance of a sports car.
acura,mdx,2010,charlie, 05/07/2010,Very impressed with 2010,pos,"The new 2010 MDX provides a smooth and quiet ride, with excellent body control in the corners (even w/o the Advance pkg).  The restyled front/rear- ends lend a more aggressive look, and together actually makes the car appear bigger than before.  The voice commands are intuitive and easy to operate, and the premium Milano leather seats are incredibly comfortable.  As with the previous gen, the fuel economy is only average for a V6.  With an MPG in the teens, I would've liked to have a bit more low-end torque, although it's a decent performer for that kind of size and heft.  The throttle is responsive and the new 6-speed auto is silky smooth.  It's a very well-rounded SUV and a great value."
acura,mdx,2010,Tom , 05/16/2010,"Great Car, lousy gas mileage",pos,"This is a great car with great comfort.  The interior is awesome and the ride is fantastic.  The advanced tech package and entertainment system is top notch.  My only real complaint is gas mileage, less than the 20 they advertise in the highway and about 15 around town"
acura,mdx,2010,Archie, 05/18/2010,Good car,pos,"This is my first MDX although I was buying Honda\Acura for the last 15 years. SUV drives like sedan, quiet in comparison with average Honda..Nice interior. "
acura,mdx,2010,Bob, 05/25/2010,Love this Vehicle,pos,"We just bought this vehicle. I got a very good price on this vehicle ($47,500 out the door). I also got some great accessories included in this price. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. We took a trip to Oregon (from Washington) and the ride was exceptionally smooth and handles great. I've owned several SUV's before, but never like this.  The cool gadgets is what I love about the MDX. NAV Voice recognition, automatic tailgate, keyless remote starting system, DVD entertainment system to name a few. I told myself ""one day I will get a luxury vehicle"" and now I finally got one! If you are shopping for a luxury SUV, I recommend the MDX.  You will be very pleasantly surprised.       "
acura,mdx,2010,Beantown 7, 05/27/2010,A very well thought out vehicle,pos,"Have owned many SUVs over the last decade, last 2 cars were a Cadillac Escalade and a Porsche Cayenne.  This vehicle has all the amenities you need in a well thought out package.  Excellent stereo in the ENT package, very useful blind spot indicator, great Nav, even the 3rd row is ok for kids. Excellent seats and ride is comfortable.  Forget the BMW and Mercedes, pricey and not nearly as comfortable inside."
acura,mdx,2010,CGDSAIL, 06/08/2010,Handles like a car,pos,This vehicle is a real pleasure to drive. The mileage is not great but I am getting 16 in the city and 18 for mixed driving and the car is not broken in yet.  I expected the mileage to be much worse during the break-in period.  The NAV system and other Tech features are great but all the buttons can be confusing. The bluetooth hands free phone feature and NAV voice commands are easy to use. The sound system sounds fantastic and the IPOD link works easily.  The back-up camera with a choice of three different views is a very nice feature.     
acura,mdx,2010,Denise, 06/10/2010,Love it! Love it! Love it!,pos,"I picked this car up 2 weeks ago and I absolutely love it!  While it's still early in the ownership experience for me, I have had no problems at all yet.  I have read some comments about the dashboard being cluttered with buttons, but this has not been an issue for me and I find everything easy to operate and understand. I purchased the Advance package with White Pearl exterior and Umber interior and it's beautiful!  It's so much fun to drive and the acceleration is swift and exhilarating!  I'm looking forward to many happy years with my new baby!"
acura,mdx,2010,CAMDX, 06/18/2010,Best luxury SUV on the market,pos,"The mdx is my first Honda/Acura, and after almost a month of ownership I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality, workmanship, and technology features of the mdx. It has plenty of room for a family of 4 . The handling and acceleration are top notch for an SUV of this size and weight, you feel confident driving it. Love the navigation, voice activation, and bluetooth connectivity. Dvd entertainment system works great. Awesome sound system. Well thought-out interior. Aggressive exterior design. Definitely a better buy for the $$ compared to other luxury SUVs from BMW, Mercedes, and Volvo. Highly recommend to others!"
acura,mdx,2010,luvCARZ, 07/05/2010,Best in class but,pos,"We bought it b/c MB gl450 lease ends in 4 months and my wife doesn't want to keep paying 2 car loans (leasing MB amg e63). Before gl, had 07 ml, 05 rx, and 01 mdx. Test drive all usual suspects. Mdx has best quality (as good as MB) and tech for price range. But I have 3 complaints. 1. Feel under power for 300 hp feel less power than 07 ml (263 hp) and hwy wind noise. 2. Questionable fuel economy. 19 mpg combined in mdx. 18 mpg for my gl450 only 1 mile diff. Hmm? 3. Quality of back-up camera is worst than my Prius. What's up with that ! "
acura,mdx,2010,Todd, 07/09/2010,Trip need more DVD Audio,pos,"I just took a 4600 mile trip from San Diego to KC down to Nashville and stopping off at Memphis. The ride of the car superb, seating is the most comfortable, I am 6'1"" and 270 lbs and never have been in a vehicle so comfortable. The AC unit did exceptional while driving through the desert in Arizona and New Mexico it was like instant cool when turning the car on after stopping for gas or food. "
acura,mdx,2010,jrdonta, 08/12/2010,Perfect 7 seats SUV except some issues,pos,"The SUV is perfect so far except the following issues 
1. Car pulled the the right (dealer fixed and said it is steering not wheel alignment) 
2. After dealer claimed fixing pulling to the right issue, the car still pulls to to right or left depends on different roads. 
3. When I reset trip A mileage average, the trip B mileage average is reset also. 
4. Accidentally, I turn of VSA then the car does not pull right or left any more (  VSA system issue? ) 
5. The plastic bolt holding cooling pad under the hood are losing after 1 week. "
acura,mdx,2010,db5644, 08/24/2010,A good blend of everything,pos,"Good upgrade from our trouble-free 2004 MDX. Honda/Acura continues to give the U.S. market what it wants in a SUV i.e. the right size, the right features, dependability, safety, resale, style (except not so much in the MDX front ends)and a choice between good value in the Honda and Luxury in the Acura. After a lot of study and considering Consumer Reports opinion, keep coming back to the MDX for the best package in a luxury SUV. "
acura,mdx,2010,Happy Owner, 08/31/2010,Very Happy,pos,"Just bought my MDX last week.  So far I am VERY impressed.  Bought it for my wife, she had owned an '03 and loved it.  I finally talked her into buying the new one so I would enjoy driving it around with the kids and her on the weekend.  I have an '05 TL and this car is just as fun, if not MORE fun, as my TL.  Handles great, lots of tricks and toys and looks fantastic.  My only gripe is the gas mileage."
acura,mdx,2010,Tien, 09/04/2010,Good Value for the money,pos,"Owned 2003 MDX and was very pleased with the reliability.  Did not want another MDX but ended up getting this one instead of the RX350 due to Value for the money.  RX350 is actually more expensive than the MDX and does not offer 3rd row seat.   Vehicle drives great so far. A couple of things.  a)  It required premium fuel.  Wife did not know and put in plus instead.  This caused the vehicle to jerk when transitioned from first to second gear.  One premium fuel is used, problem went away.  b) Leather seat is fairly easy to get dirty.   Interior is compatible with RX350.  Lexus used to has much better interior in the past but 2010 RX350 has similar leather grade as MDX 2010."
acura,mdx,2010,danny1878, 09/04/2010,Best Handling & Very Roomy,pos,"Acura electronics, SH-AWD, ACC and body roll is the best (feel like driving a sedan). Wish it has better MPG than 19.7. Roomiest seats among competitor such as RX, BMW, etc."
acura,mdx,2010,Bruced4, 09/12/2010,Gotta love this one!,pos,"Fast, nimble, comfortable, killer stereo. This is an amazing vehicle. It drives more like a sports car than an SUV. Incredible in the corners. Great power throughout the RPM band with smooth delivery from the 6 speed tranny. I have heard some complaints about gas mileage but I get 18 all around - quite good for this size vehicle. I think this is probably the best value in a luxury SUV out there, so make sure it is on your test drive short list.   "
acura,mdx,2010,Newowner, 09/09/2010,A well rounded SUV,pos,"I cant believe its almost better than a sedan, the way MDX controls its body roll, sudden stop with almost no head bobbing. Very quiet compared to my TL'04 and a ton of gadgets. I've always said that I'm not really into SUV (not fast enuf, heavy bodyroll, poor handling and sipping gas like crazy). Those impressions I got after i test drove X5 n RX but MDX adv has both world. With Adv model's price, I cud go with X5 premium or diesel, but reliability is my main concern. 7 seat is also a plus, bigger than X5 and it seems MDX sells better. After watching a youtube's video how MDX was compared with audi/RX in 20-30 degreed steep climbing an icy/snowy ramp, I knew my choice."
acura,mdx,2010,Brent, 10/10/2010,Disappoited,neu,"The audio system is both good and horrible. The AM radio is the worst I have ever heard on any vehicle, regardless of price. There is no mid-range at all, making it sound as though it is being played through a megaphone. Interestingly enough, when playing the hard drive, or CD, it sound much better. "
acura,mdx,2010,JR, 10/31/2010,Awesome SUV,pos,"The powertrain (engine and transmission) are unbelievable smooth.  The six speed transmission is a significant improvement over the previous 5 speed one.  Seat comfort is a perfect 10 as is the interior design. Handling is agile, especially for a vehicle this size.  Outward visibility is excellent, the ELS stereo sounds fantastic along with its USB/IPOD integration and the ability to rip CDs right to the hard drive.  The leather is soft and supple and the ride is extremely composed at all speeds.  A sporty yet comfortable suspension is the way to go and this vehicle nails it.  Gas mileage is as expected given this vehicles size & weight if no better than others for its size."
acura,mdx,2010,SJ, 11/14/2010,The Sports Sedan of mid-size SUVs,pos,"Traded in a 2005 Honda Pilot. The Pilot's acceleration, cornering, and braking can't compare to the MDX. I have it out on the twisty roads of the Sierra Nevada. It feels like a decent sports sedan, not an SUV. The interior ambience if the MDX is way more luxurious than the Pilot. Another huge difference is road noise.  There is very little road noise in the MDX.  Gas mileage is disappointing.  At 8,000 miles on the odometer, I am still not hitting the EPA highway mileage on longer trips.  So far it is has not had a single reliability issue. If is is as reliable as my previous 3 Acuras, it will be a 10. "
acura,mdx,2010,yar7, 01/24/2011,Overall satisfied but plenty of room for improvement !!!,pos,"After having a bad experience with the dealer who insisted & put a different remote starter because of supposedly Acura's is not reliable and dealing with Acura headquarters who were not responsive to our complaints, I am now content with my 2010 MDX ,7,500 miles on it. There is room for improvement in terms of gas mileage, noise reduction and quality of interior materials."
acura,mdx,2010,mark3840, 01/02/2011,A little disappointed,neu,"This is my wife's car although I drive it often. I'm not a huge fan of the MDX. It suited our needs and was a good value compared to other luxury CUV's. Way too many buttons and very confusing to navigate the controls and nav system. Voice commands are useless - even difficult to make a simple phone call.
(In the Genesis you just push 1 button and say, ""dial home,"" for example.) Nav & stereo, although rated high, doesn't even belong in the same league as the Genesis. Seams are not tight. Quite a bit of noise for a lux CUV. Good power and ride as well as fairly comfortable. I like it overall but I hope Hyundai comes out with a luxury CUV soon, because it will blow away Acura."
acura,mdx,2010,Pedro Rivera, 01/04/2017,Kick ass sports sedan with SUV cargo space.,pos,"I was looking for an SH-AWD TL, but after a long story with a dealer ended up with this MDX; and LOVE IT!!! It is a fast SUV, with sports sedan like feel. Loving the dealers screw up!!!
"
acura,mdx,2010,maryalyce, 05/15/2018,Love this MDX Technology Model,pos,"This was my first Acura. I switch from a Volvo because the technology was lacking in the Volvo. I have been very pleased with this car. I do take it to the dealership for service. I have no complaints with this car, except the voice command can't understand my commands sometimes!!!:)

"
acura,mdx,2011,kris2, 09/02/2011,Best value,pos,"Needed a sooner than expected replacement after my 2005 X5 3.0 got totalled. After looking at 2012 X5, 2011 Q7 and 2011 MDX I ended up purchasing the MDX and I am not disappointed.

In terms of performance I did not feel it a lot different than the X5. Torque felt low but there is enough power when you need and the brakes feel good. 

Been getting 17 mpg in mixed driving with 60-70% city using premium. 

Kids like the third row though the access is difficult like all third row SUVs. Seats are comfortable and provide support. You will get used to the power tailgate and backup camera in no time. 

Got the roof rails (should have been standard) so it looks like an SUV and I like the look."
acura,mdx,2011,becca00, 05/11/2011,WOW!!!,pos,"This is my second Acura (first was a 2010 TL Tech).
I fell in love with Acura after my first one, this one is even better.
I came out of a 2007 Suburban into the TL.
Great for me but my kids (boys, 16 & 12) didn't have as much room as they would have liked in the back seat.
So.. traded it for the MDX.
This is, by far, the BEST SUV in it's class.
I wake up everyday and cannot WAIT to drive it!
Somewhere, anywhere, I don't care as long as I'm driving.
I live on a curvy, hilly road and this car handles like a sports car (I have a MINI S too, so I know).
Handling, braking, steering, interior, exterior- all perfect.
Only one thing... just a LITTLE too much road noise.
Still the best!!!"
acura,mdx,2011,ploftis, 08/02/2011,Best 7 Seater Luxury SUV,pos,"We've had the MDX for about 2000 miles now and absolutely love it.
It's extremely comfortable and has a very smooth ride which is balanced with excellent handling for something so large.
Power is always there, but shines with highway passing which is exceptional
Looks beautiful inside and out and has the most comforable interior I've even been in.
The controls take some getting used to but once you do that, the technology is excellent."
acura,mdx,2011,el_pic, 01/25/2011,2011 MDX Advance,pos,"MDX = Multi Dimensional LuXover. It's not a rugged 4x4 SUV and its not a sports car but it is AWD and a luxury performance way to 5+2. Compared to 2011 others in its class (and be certain to compare the same class) ... Ten:
Infinity FX - Nine: Grand Cherokee Overland - Eight: Land Rover LR4 HSE - Seventh: Volkswagen Touareg V-6 - Sixth: Volvo XC90 Sport - Fifth: Lexus GX470 - Fourth: Mercedes-Benz ML350 - Third: BMW X5 3.0si - Second: Cadillac SRX AWD V-8 - First: Acura MDX.
Better price, handling, dependability, fit, finish. Enuff said !

Pros: Luxury Performance Value Dependability ! 
Cons: Single engine drivetrain choice - no Turbo, diesel, hybrid. "
acura,mdx,2011,janetrich, 09/28/2011,Heated Seats,pos,"I purchased the 2011 MDX in August and simply love the SUV.
I have always owned a Honda and wanted to own the luxury line of Acura.
I love the car but since I drove it out of the dealership I have had problems with the drivers side heated seat (back rest).
It feels like it is always on.
I have taken it back to the dealers and they ran tests on it but insist that it is fine. But my back always sweats.
They will not do anything about it but have told me that other people have brought in their MDX saying the same thing, that the back of the seat feels like it is always heated.
Does anyone else have this problem?
Maybe if enough people complain they will issue a recall."
acura,mdx,2011,swedenva, 04/08/2011,MDX with Tech Package,pos,"I purchased 2011 MDX from Pohanka Acura, largest dealer in U.S.
Got the best deal from all dealers in DC area.
Others not even close.
Pro:
Fit and finish; ride and tech package;


Con:
gas mileage, third row seats for adults cramped; visors cheap; premium gasoline; not enough cup holders;


Overall, very satisfied and expect to keep 5+ years. Still a much better value then the BMW X5; Mercedes GL/M Class; Infiniti QX56; Cadillac Escalade and Lexus GX460."
acura,mdx,2011,gdh12, 03/03/2012,"Aggressive styling, great value & a blast to drive",pos,"Unlike any other vehicle we have owned, after 16 months and 30k miles, I still get excited at every opportunity to drive our MDX.
I love the unique, aggressive styling and, after driving large SUVs for many years, the sports car feel and performance of the MDX makes it a blast to drive.
The interior is roomy, high quality and very comfortable.
Second row seats are comparable to front seats - very comfortable for adults or children.
The technology and entertainment packages are outstanding - best nav and DVD systems I have seen.
Voice activation features work great.
We average about 16 mpg in mostly city driving, but get 20-21 on freeway trips, better at lower highway speeds.

 "
acura,mdx,2011,mmr183, 10/03/2011,Great choice for nexus of features / function / value,pos,"Delighted with driving performance and comfort in our MDX. Owner profile can help, so share we are 55-plus couple and retired. Key factors for us in vehicle purchase are safety, comfort, cargo space, driving ease and reliability.


Considered Volvo XC90. Lexus Rx & GX, BMW x3 & x5.
Nutshell version is we didnt think any measured up against MDX for nexus of features / function / value.

Small snafu in our MDX has been the voice recognition system doesn't always translate some female voice commands correctly. 

We like the seemingly controversial grille / front end design. Looks sleek to us. Beauty in the eye of the beholder we guess. Love the look of the Bronze / Parchment combo."
acura,mdx,2011,svofan1, 09/26/2010,2011 MDX BASE..GREAT !!!!!,pos,"Just purchased the MDX base model this past Saturday, and so far I am very impress with the quality of build, features (bluetooth is great ) and in general very please with the purchased. I know is too soon but so far I am not regreting getting the base model over the TEch....afetrall $4k difference to me is a lot for nav and a few other features that I will not ahve a great use for"
acura,mdx,2011,tolson37, 05/04/2011,Simply Awesome,pos,"Very nice package - I've had about 30 different new cars and trucks over the years and this is a package that has sport, utility, technology, comfort, reliability, and safety all wrapped into a single package.
I have 2500 miles on my 2011 Tech with Entertainment system.
Not one thing has gone wrong.
Enjoy every ride / trip in it.
Plenty of power and nice powerband with 6 speed transmission."
acura,mdx,2011,kbgcpa, 11/03/2010,Acura MDX 2011,pos,Picked up 2011 Acura MDX on Saturday after trying to get a good deal on a   2010 but dealership made me a good offer. Had a Lexus RX 330 and then 350 for the last six years. Glad I switched needed more room but still wanted luxury. Drive is very powerful and I actual like the front grill which I could not stand at first. The buttons are very easy to get used to just use the tutorial online.
acura,mdx,2011,suitespot, 01/16/2011,"My first, but definitely not my last Acura!",pos,"A most impressive vehicle.
Mechanically superior to any other comparable tested.
Great ride, terrific fit and finish.
Traction -- starting and stopping -- with Michelin's in Michigan winter is great.
That tuning of the suspension at Nurburgring made a great AWD even better.
And, it's made in North America!

Can see why Motor Trend and Car and Driver have rated at top of class!"
acura,mdx,2011,tornadog, 11/11/2011,A nice upgrade from the Pilot,pos,"The MDX is a perfect marriage of a sturdy, well designed SUV witht e comforts and handling of a car. The interior is very nicely designed, the tech gadgets in the car is a treat to use. The rid eis super comfortable and while the mileage is a hog, it is still better than my 2010 Pilot."
acura,mdx,2011,maxbailey, 12/28/2011,Disappointed about my dream car!,neu,"I have been waiting nearly 7 years to buy an MDX.
I purchased my vehicle just over 6 months ago.
I love it...it is beautiful!
However, it has left me stranded several times and the technicians at Acura are stumped.
A message keeps appearing...""check starter system.""
Acura has had my vehicle on several occasions now.
They replaced the computer system and thought the problem was solved.
However, this morning after the vehicle sat in my garage for 3 days, I got in the vehicle and the XM radio stations were all reset to the preview channel, my #1 driver memory was gone and the a/c was on max.
I never leave the a/c or heat on when I shut off the vehicle. Tonight the vehicle won't start:-("
acura,mdx,2011,thomas642, 04/07/2011,"Nice ride, but-------------",pos,"Living in central Florida but bought in IL. have seen a vast variety of driving situations.
Handles excellent on snow and ice and does well with side gusts of wind.

Considered Enclave but build quality of Acura far superior.
MDX built like a vault.
Would like to see better gas mileage and wonder why the need for premium fuel and no cyl. deactivation as in my past Honda van.
Mileage as advertised though.
Only problem so far is occasional cruise control issues as it will cancel and car has to be shut off to get it to work.
No help from Acura on this.
Best radio I've ever had by far and I've had some good ones.
In black with optional chrome wheels, it's a beauty I love to drive."
acura,mdx,2011,panic492, 02/27/2011,"Very Good Value, Fun, Some Improvements Needed",pos,"I have had my '11 Nav/Tech for about a month now and I am overall very happy. The engine is silky smooth and the seats are very comfortable-it is a pleasure to drive. The tech ""stuff"" is great-nav, voice, IPod recognition...I also looked at the Audi Q7 (close 2nd choice) and BMW X5 (distant 3rd choice). My small complaints about the MDX are the fake wood trim, it is plastic. When the sun hit's it, it blinds you. Also, the visors are very flimsy. No big issues so far other than my AC is giving me a bit of a funny smell, probably needs a new air filter. Should be a reliable, fun SUV. "
acura,mdx,2011,KingofKings, 09/21/2015,Most Reliable Luxury with out breaking the bank,pos,"Try and get the CPO with an extended warranty just for a clear mind, but you might not need it, vehicle is highly reliable in my opinion.  Interior could have been made more attractive looking in comparison to other luxury vehicles but than again the MDX cost a little less.  Audi Q7 interior is someone better but the car is less reliable, and cost more to maintain.  I will highly recommend this vehicle, there may be others with more luxurious options but they would cost more to maintain.  Just Be aware of some dealerships service personal creating a residual customer out of you.
"
acura,mdx,2011,pjc123, 08/17/2011,"Solid Choice, very good vehicle",pos,"We have owned the MDX Tech for 4.5 months and 5,300 miles.
Overall, we are really happy with the vehicle.
It is good looking, fun to drive and perfect for our family of 4 to go camping and on vacations.
The gas mileage has been slightly over 18 combined which is fine by me.
The only suggestions for improvement would be the transmission and stereo.
Granted, we were ""spoiled"" with an Audi but... the MDX is smooth shifting but sometimes you have to coax it to the proper gear especially when it is loaded up.
The ELS surround sound is just adequate but NOTHING like the Bose in an Audi.
All that said, I know the Acura will be MUCH more reliable than the Audi.
I also own a 2006 TL."
acura,mdx,2011,Michael L, 09/02/2016,Couldn't be happier!,pos,"Bought mine used with about 30k on it. I now have 107k on it and could not be happier. I did tons of research before selecting this make and model. The instrumentation and navigation is excellent! No car I have ever driver beats its user friendly approach and boasts the same functionality. Acura service is fantastic. You get Lexus like service without the cost. Sure its more than my wife's toyota or a Honda, but only marginally. If I had to come up with a complaint it is this: I get all service done at the dealer and just about everytime I am in there they have some sort of recommended service. Then again, I think all dealers do this. It has plenty of acceleration when using the paddle shifters (which are great), but the std acceleration could be a tad better for those very heavy foot drivers. But the handling is great and the driveability is perfect. SH-AWD is money in the corners and about 18mpg with this is good enough for me - esp since I have a heavier foot. I am a big guy at 6'5"" 260lbs and this car gives me plenty of room. Even the back seat is nice with its reclining seats. 3rd row is for small adults or kids. I highly recommend this vehicle to just about any driver - you will not be disappointed!!

acura,mdx,2011,Let Down, 01/12/2018,Great until about 115K miles,neu,"Loved this vehicle until the engine started burning oil at 115K miles. Online forums showed I was not the only one with this issue. Great ride and handling, lousy mileage with premium fuel. I would rate this vehicle a 5 star if it would have lasted as long as I was hoping it would."
acura,mdx,2011,Mike Greteman, 01/30/2017,Be Wary of Surprisingly Expensive Repairs,neg,"I bought my 2011 MDX used from a family member, who had put 100,000 highway miles on the vehicle. For the most part, I have been very happy  with the performance of the vehicle, however I was shocked to receive a $4,000 estimate to replace my front struts and rear shocks from the dealer for the car's ""electronic"" suspension. At the dealership, the Acura maintenance person told me the expense would be covered under the extended warranty. As Acura had extended the warranty particularly for problems with the SUV's electronic suspension, they had acknowledged the problem and were doing the ""right"" thing by repairing it for free. However, the maintenance person went back on his word and subsequently informed me that my vehicle actually did not qualify for the extended warranty. I further voiced my complaints by calling the Acura Care line, and the representative told me there was a good chance that Acura could make a ""goodwill exception"" for my vehicle, allowing the repair to be covered under the warranty. However, once the representative called me back, he informed me that because I bought the car with greater than 100,000 miles on it, albeit from a relative, it did not qualify. I just wanted to post this review to draw attention to my experience. Overall, I have enjoyed the car, however I will never buy an Acura again. $4,000 - $7,000 expenses on a car worth $17,000 doesn't make sense, and I’ve been very disappointed by the false promises made by the company.

Compared with the bmw x5 i kept coming back to this suv for comparable ride/handling and the price difference was the clincher! 3rd row standard on MDX, upgrade on BMW, leasing a base model with NOTHING out of pocket for $610 a month!!!  will add DVD player for kids for 1k later on and get a garmin for Nav.  no need to pay extra 10k for all the extra gadgets. the performance and exterior of the truck are the same no matter the tech package."
acura,mdx,2011,tmh1, 03/11/2011,Great family SUV.,pos,"I have owned my MDX for 6 months and am very happy with the choice.
I looked at the Mercedes M-class, the Audi Q5, a Subuaru Outback,
and a Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland.
I chose the MDX because it had the best overall package for my needs:
nice interior for work, rear leg room, navigation system and electronics, and good handling.
The navigation system and voice commands are the best - recognizes the voice easily.
However, it is not optimized for all Blackberry phones, so keep that in mind.
This SUV drives like a car and is a breeze to park.
Kids don't complain in back seat and I have teenagers.
Great family car. "
acura,mdx,2011,bgf18, 12/11/2012,Good - with minor complaints,pos,"2011 MDX - Tech Package.
Decided to buy out our 2011 MDX lease...my wife loves it that much. This car is very comfortable on the road as it is reasonably quiet and seats have excellent support. Visisibility is good for an SUV. Room for luggage is minimal with all three rows being used, very good when only two rows. The SH-AWD works really well, but I would GLADLY give it up for a front-wheel drive version if GAS MILAGE would improve. Fit and finish is good, although I could live without the three square feet of PLASTIC wood on the dash. For a family of three, this is the perfect SUV. Fam of four would be ok, five would be tight. More than five is pointless unless going on short drives."
acura,mdx,2011,jrm1955, 06/19/2012,Another quality Acura product,pos,"This is one of many Acuras I have owned over the past 20 years and I could not be happier with this vehicle. It is roomy, comfortable and provides a level of performance that I was not expecting from a large SUV. The adjustable suspension has proven useful by giving the choice of a comfortable ride or sportier handling. Gas mileage is par for the course in this market segment. Resale value is also strong which was another factor in my choosing this vehicle. Love the sound of that big V6 too when you pull out to pass. Much more entertaining than a Lexus RX350 to drive."
acura,mdx,2011,Jeff L., 11/27/2010,Nissan Sales Manager Hung Up On the MDX,pos,I have been in the auto industry for 14 years and have owned over 50 vehicles and now with 3 little girls of my own I have come to understand the value of space and reliability and the MDX has all of these on its mind! We traded a 2010 Honda Odyssey in becuase if the overall minivan depression most parents feel  when the switch is made and this car not only does it all but easily fits 2 car seats and a booster. The controlls are easy to manage and the MDX drives like a sports car. I am an Acura fan and this car is no disappointment if you have the means do yourself a favotr and get one!
acura,mdx,2011,LeawoodEsq, 10/03/2017,Nearly Perfect,pos,"The 2011 Acura MDX with Technology and Entertainment packages is a very good mid-sized SUV . Some reviews call it a large SUV, but to the owner of a Chevy Suburban and a GMC Acadia, it is mid-sized and shows it most in the third row seating. Other reviews have covered the high points - quality of materials, driving position, handling, power, transmission, and the fantastic ELS sound system among them - so I am going to focus on the few things that detract and may have all been corrected in the latest model. The backup camera at night that is so dark it is dangerous to rely on for backing up. The radio tuning knob seems to be geared at 50:1 - you'll know what I mean when you try to go from Channel 18 to Channel 176 on Sirius/XM. The side mirrors do not fold electrically. The tailgate that does not power open when using the outside hand release. The third row seats do not power up and down, an inconvenience when hands are full. And there is no push-button start/keyless entry, which is hard to explain when so many other contemporary, comparable vehicles have it. On balance, however, I enjoy owning and driving the 2011 MDX. The engine pulls well, the transmission always seems to be in the correct gear and drops down quickly for rapid acceleration, and the steering is quick. The relatively short wheelbase makes parking easy. The high-beam headlights are as outstandingly bright as the backup camera is dim at night. The center stack of the dashboard - the topic of broad criticism - is straightforward if you compartmentalize it into three sections: top for HVAC, middle for media, and bottom for navigation/information. The ride is compliant and not too harsh for an SUV. The buttery-soft leather seating is of a very high grade and the front and second-row seats are very comfortable. After 67,000 miles it looks brand new. A great mid-sized SUV that seats five adults comfortably and two children in the third row in a pinch.

acura,mdx,2011,John N., 05/23/2016,Overall -Best car I've owned.,pos,"Dealer repair quality is lacking consistency.
In 6 years and 92k miles the repair bills have been less than $500, outside of routine maintenance.
New tires & brakes last month, 79,000miles each and still had wear to go ( not much).
Terrible nav system, Acura is UN-responsive and so is the supplier. Gets lost-can't even find the local hospital. 
Entertainment system is good but not worth the money. the Tech Package is a rip off.
HVAC has some quirks but OK. Seat coolers broke down(poor quality parts )and had to be replaced. Extended warranty paid. Can't imagine true cost to fix!
Backup lights are TERRIBLE - buy some LED ""reflector"" type bulbs from Amazon $20. They help
gas milage is poor 18-20. 
ACC - adaptive cruise control is FANTASTIC. can't wait for lane holding etc.
Super luxury it is not -but a nice car that always runs (so far) and doesn't break you wallet.

acura,mdx,2011,danmoch, 01/02/2011,"Excellent value in a 7 seat SUV, awesome in the snow!",pos,"Purchased '10 MDX in June '10. Needed an AWD/4WD SUV >5 seats with tow hitch, priced under 50K. Also have '09 BMW X5 35d (diesel) which I love. First looked at another X5, but 3rd seat optioned vehicles were hard to find.
The MDX drives well everyday, has nice electronic things (nav, rear cam, bluetooth, ipod/usb adapter.) Rear seatbacks tilt back a few degrees making the difference between an okay seat (BMW) and a nice relaxing one. Interior space definitely bigger/more usable than in '09 X5.
Where the MDX really shines is its snow traction. This car is better on snowy town roads in the Tahoe area than my X5. Note MDX = Michelin Latitude tires, BMW = Bridgestone Dueler runflats."
acura,mdx,2011,DILJIT KARAYIL, 10/28/2010,A Great Buy,pos,Took me 4 months and a lot of comparison to nail it down to the MDX.Compared to BMW X5 and Audi Q7 Great stability and handling.Does the corners well. Good Pick Up and a host of convenient features.GPS w/ weather and traffic is great.3rd row is ideal for kids and slim adults but other than that it is spacious. Braking is smooth and the headlights are nice. 
acura,mdx,2011,akanorm, 03/03/2011,Excellent Value,pos,"I've had the MDX for about 2 months and have driven it about 1k miles.
It handles well for an SUV and the quality and the technology is equivalent to that of BMW and Lexus.
I also, considered the A4 and A6 Audi, Avante,
The A4 was too small and the A6 was not readily availability
subsequently the dealer were asking nearly list price for the A6.

Overall, I'm pleased with the car and would suggest others in the market for an SUV to test drive the MDX."

It is affordable and offers all the things you need most in a day to day around town vehicle with children. Comfort, class, room, and options are excellent. The dealership here is a pleasure to do business with as well.

acura,mdx,2011,Nj mdx owner, 07/19/2019,Great Suv with Engine issue,pos,"After owning 2 Acuras, one CL and one MDX, Acura is still a great carmaker, however if an acura has an issue, it is almost impossible to deal with the Acura Dealers! My Acuras had to get transmission replaced and engine fixed due to losing oil. The warranty covered both, however extremely difficult to get dealers to acknowledge these kind of issues. They are dismissive of you until enough customers complain! It's frustrating, ridiculous and very bad customer service! Otherwise these acts are fine and hold up well and are reliable but the MDX not so good on gas.
"
acura,mdx,2011,Ned, 11/22/2019,Excessive Oil Consumption,neg,"We like the MDX for the first few years, however the oil consumption is more than acceptable as the vehicle ages. We need to add more oil because it’s bone dry before the maintenance minder even reaches 50%. Acura ran the oil consumption test and claims its within spec.  I wasn’t satisfied with this answer and tried to push the issue and now they’ve stopped returning my calls.  I’ve always like Acura but after this experience it has me rethinking them on future purchases.

acura,mdx,2011,jack1973, 09/19/2012,2011 Acura MDX,neu,"I had this vehicle for 18 months and recently traded it in due to a couple reasons.

- on a combination of city and highway driving I was avg'ing 16 mpg. I understand its an SUV but find this number unacceptable.

- The interior in this vehicle is horrrible. Not only is the design bad but the leather is cheap and showed massive wear with only 10,000 miles on the vehicle. The dash is covered in fake wood and there were many rattles in the car.

The ride is extremely hard and road noise is prominent.

Exterior is really nice but the interior and gas mileage really started to weigh on me.

I guess thats what you get when you try to make a Honda a luxury car."
acura,mdx,2011,mvarga, 12/04/2011,Good Value,pos,"I have had the 2011 Acura MDX w/Advance Package for about six months now, and I somewhat regret my decision to buy an Acura.
While the ventilated seats and blind spot assist are great, the interior quality is lacking. For a car that costs over $50,000, I would expect a lot less plastic and authentic wood trim.
If you are looking to buy a seven passenger midsize SUV, I would also consider the Lexus GX460 or the Audi Q7 because both of those vehicles have interiors that are far superior to that of the MDX's.
Overall, I think that you get a lot for a cheap price.
I would definitely recommend the Advance Package because it has many useful features."
acura,mdx,2011,Chae, 11/02/2010,MDX is awesome!,pos,"MDX is my third time car. I got impressed by the new technology of this car. I could feel this car gives me a very comfortable and fast reactiong driving time while I am in the car. I can't believe this is SUV. Especially when I make  turnings on curved roads, this car gives me real safe turnings; well-balanced, smooth, and fast. And the navigation technology is so wonderful that I am not afraid of visiting anywhere I have never been to. Also, the sound system of this car is very very cool! I feel like I am in a theater while I watch a DVD. My Kids love watching DVD in this car sooo much. No doubt! "
acura,mdx,2011,bala_71, 08/12/2012,Not worth the hype..,neg,"First of all, I am
surprised that why I am alone in finding lots of minute problems with this SUV. Are people insanely happy about owning a poorly designed SUV? These are not 20K Civics. Having said that, I am not going to argue that this should drive like a Ferrari or Aston Martin. But come on!
With in the last 11 months, I had to visit the dealer for vibration issues many times. One issue they fixed by adjusting the suspension system. But now I have a vibration in steering wheel at above 70 mph. The dealer convinced me that that's how these cars drive.
I think its due to the factory installed tires. But they won't accept it! I now have a vibration coming from the roof-top too!"
acura,mdx,2011,jon, 10/07/2010,2011 MDX - terrific nav and stereo,pos,"Picked up new Acura w/ tech package a week ago with silver roof rack and running boards, very comfortable seats in front and second row with plenty of leg room, love the exterior styling and just today went on a trip to the airport to drop off a family member and returned rush hour crossing the nyc metro area; made much easier by the nav system which redirected around various congested traffic areas and the upgraded stereo is probably the best I have owned or heard. Performance has been improved in 2010 by Acura on the MDX and it makes it a much smoother and peppy drive than the 2009 and prior."
acura,mdx,2011,SMB, 09/30/2018,Best car I've ever owned! and most comfortable!,pos,"The comfort of the leather seats, both front and back, is outstanding.  The stereo system is fantastic as well.  My only complaint is the gas mileage.  I bought the car used and have owned it for four years.  No issues whatsoever.  The grandkids love the third row.  You can easily put three car seats in the middle section.  I can't see me driving anything else now.  Love it!

Unfortunately after driving it for a year, I've been disappointed numerous times by the way Acura cut corners to save a buck.
It just doesn't feel like a luxury car.
It basically feels like a Honda.
This car is not nearly worth the $50K price tag it touts.
To add insult to injury, the sales team at the dealership was horrible.
Do not buy your Acura from Hendrick Acura!!!
I'm so disappointed by this car and the service that I'm in the process of transferring my lease. I just can't drive or pay for this car any longer."
acura,mdx,2011,Nesser94, 08/20/2019,Very reliable! Premium Gas sucks,pos,"I bought my MDX after researching it for years. I knew it would be reliable, and it has been for the six months I’ve owned it. I’m disappointed with the insane amount of money it takes to operate the MDX. Going from a smaller car averaging 24mpg with unleaded to an SUV averaging 16-18mpg on premium is not fun. I will be selling my MDX for this reason as my family is expanding and cannot justify the gas expense. Maybe one day I will buy another one when I can afford the premium gas. 
"
acura,mdx,2011,acuraleak, 04/27/2011,Worst car ownership experience,neg,"Within two weeks after purchasing the MDX, with 300 miles only, transmission fluid leaking was found.

It's a nightmare owning this car. This will be my first and last Acura. "
acura,mdx,2011,whomiam1, 11/14/2011,Don't get Nav - waste of money,neu,"I purchased a 2011 MDX earlier this year and got the tech package in order to have built in navigation.
I love my old Garmin and wouldn' travel without navigation again.
Unfortunately after purchasing it I found it to be so outdated and inaccurate that it is nearly useless.
I have to install my Garmin anyway.
I later learned that Acura uses a system made by a little company that has no credibility.
WHY!
You would think that with Acura's reputation on line they would look for a REAL nav system from one of the major producers.
I just hope i can prevent others from making the same mistake.
PS: if your thinking of getting a Lexus instead their system is apparently even worse."
acura,mdx,2011,xfbai, 04/30/2011,MDX quality and reliability,neg,"Was so happy after bought a 2011 MDX Base model on Saturday, however discovered a problem the very next day that it would jerk when decelerating from 35~40MPH to around 15MPH without breaking. The jerk is 100% reproducible and getting worse and worse. Brought back to dealer twice and finally convinced them it is problem that need to be fixed. Eventually they figured out that a secondary valve on the transmission is faulty! How could this happen on a brand new car? 
After replacing $200+ part, the problem is fixed. My new car has to stay in the shop for 3 days in the very first week. Really worry about the build quality. It will be my last and final MDX."
acura,mdx,2011,richtn1, 07/20/2011,Not my Old MDX,neu,"After 3 months My 2011 MDX is now on a Used car lot. I owned a 2005 MDX that I loved! It rode great, was reliable and got decent gas miliage. 
The new version is nothing like that. It rides like a Dump Truck, guzzles gas and is like being in a torture chamber. Seats are hard, controls are annoying and confusing. To top that, the dealership was awful. I purchased my previous MDX from Crown Accira of Richmond and it was a fun experience, This time ,the sales person was texting on my test drives and most of the time acted like she was doing me a favor taking me out. The manager was eating chicken on a console right as you walk into the dealership. It was a real side show. Horrible!"
acura,mdx,2011,g35shopper, 12/20/2010,Moved from a Lexus RX,pos,Took delivery of a 2011 last Saturday. Mostly very pleased. The exception would be the mpg. My Lexus was bullet proof but just too dull to buy another one. The MDX handles much better and the transmission is much more decisive. I do have to admit that I can tell why the RX commands a price premium. The interior and the controls in the MDX feel cheaper (although acceptable).

Well, I am looking to downsize my life while not giving up everything.
Then MDX offers all I need and what I want.
Versatility, sportiness, comfort, performance, and better MPG.
Thought about LEXUS, MERCEDES, and found the pricing too high.
The Range Rover does not provide the reliability and resale of ACURA."
acura,mdx,2012,Dave M, 04/25/2017,Oil Burner!,neg,"Bought a used 2012 MDX to replace a 2007 MDX.  Quickly discovered it burns oil at a rate of a quart every 1100 miles.  Thought the previous owner had abused the engine and not changed oil regularly.  WRONG. Seems that most ""reviewers"" and organizations have missed the fact that Acura has a bad engine - the J37A - out there on the 2008-2014 MDX.  A new cylinder material is rumored to be abrasive against the piston rings - and the oil is being burned quickly.  Acura has taken the stance that a quart/1000 miles is ""normal.""  And they are only ponying up money to totally irate consumers with signing of an NDA.  There is the rumor that the rings were installed improperly at the factory.  Initial statistics show that over 11% of Acura MDX's have this problem with the J37A engine.  Advise strongly again buying unless some warranty guarantee from Acura.  The problem has shown up in cars with as few as 40,000 miles.  Usually AFTER the warranty is expired.  Caution!!!

acura,mdx,2012,jg88, 04/14/2015,"My ""New"" 2012 MDX - 2k miles so far",pos,"Just bought a 2012 MDX Tech CPO with 30k miles and am pretty darn happy with it.  Tested the X5 and X3, the Q5, the ML 350 and the similarly sized Infinity; the MDX was hard to beat for overall driving, quality build and standard features.  SH-AWD is in a class of its own for on-the-road traction and performance.  Driving during a couple of heavy down pour is a breeze.  Surprisingly it has decent ground clearance for logging roads and unimproved two-tracks yet felt lower in driving than the others.  Noticed how low in the bonnet the engine sits, must be how Acura lowered it's center of gravity.  Lastly, could not believe the deal I struck with Acura vs. the German cars - much better.

Three years later, now with 52K miles - not one issue or problem with the MDX.  We've taken it many long trips, have used it for carrying large items - still going great as a people and cargo mover.  One area of concern, the MPG seems to have fallen both for local and highway driving.  On a recent 3K trip from TX to NM to CO and back back, overall MPG for the trip was about 19.5.  A year earlier, on essentially the same trip, it was about 21 MPG overall.  Have also noticed lower MPG for local driving, about 15 - 16 versus 17.5 during the 1st 2 years.  Not sure why this is.

Our needs were to fit full size cello in the back, 3 kids, 7 sitting capability occasionally for a car pool.
Drivability and passenger comfort with technology to protect them.
Acura MDX won at the end with the Advance and Entertainment features and space.
 Mercedes GL was close, had good room but much more expensive if decked out and the reliability history was not as good if reading feed back from internet.
Did not drive as easy as Lexus GX and Acura.
Lexus GX was best liked by driver sitting but not by the passengers (kids) secondary to cramped 2nd sitting and incredibly cramped 3rd row even for kids."

I had planned to buy a smaller 4x4 such as the Acura RDX or Honda CRV, but the MDX has the road manners of a smaller, sporty vehicle along with every convenience and safety feature I wanted.
Gas mileage was a concern until it returned over 21 mpg on 1,000 mile round trip while fully loaded that mostly exceeded legal Interstate speeds.
I expect better when it is broken in.
The ability to control so many vehicle functions by voice is amazing and the Acura navigation system (reputedly the best on the planet) even knows its way around the back woods of South Carolina!"

The car drives and handles very well and comes with a laundry list of standard options.
I wanted to check out the new Explorer before we bought this one but the Ford dealership was too difficult to deal with.
A relative of ours just bought the Toyota Highlander which I also like but the MDX handles better in my view.
I was also able to get a better deal than the Edmunds True Market Value.
Our kids love the car."
acura,mdx,2012,sebring95, 12/07/2013,Great value and decent features,neu,"We've had this for a little over a year and 30k miles.
It was really no more expensive than a loaded Honda/Ford/GM SUV.
Normally I wouldn't buy a ""luxury"" brand for our family hauler given the 25k-30k miles per year we drive, but operating costs on an Acura are a fraction of the Euro brands.
Depreciation also appears to be significantly more favorable.
Transmission is relatively lazy and you have to keep after it to capitalize on the 300hp.
Backup camera is terrible at night.
Gas mileage is as expected...averaging 19.5 and 21-22 on long trips at 75mph.
Unless you're comparing it to something significantly more expensive or smaller, this is a great overall vehicle."
acura,mdx,2012,bulldog1979, 11/21/2011,A Welcome Change,pos,"I traded my 2009 RL for the 2012 MDX. I was looking for more room, and was willing to give up some technology to get it. I now feel I have a win/win situation. I have the elbow room I sought, and don't feel I've given up any significant features. I now have a navigation screen I can see in the day or with my sunglasses on. The voice command system is more reliable/logical. The sound system seems just as good. I now have the hard drive storage for CDs. The power and acceleration seem better. The interior has high quality materials. It is a little thirstier by about 2 miles/gal. I miss the keyless ignition."
acura,mdx,2012,Lee Hoagland, 07/08/2017,Great SUV substitute for sport sedan,pos,"I’ll try to keep this short and simple.

• The gen2 MDX drives much smaller than it is. Even with the high ground clearance, it rivals many sport sedans, especially with the Advance pkg that comes with the Active Damper System (ADS) in sport mode. The overall dimensions (length, height, width, and track) lend themselves to a wide, stocky, and aggressive stance that handles very well.
• The J37A1 engine is no slouch and while the 0-60 split isn’t fantastic at 7.1 seconds, it has more than enough torque for brisk highway merging and passes. Bear in mind it is a high-revving engine, so you really have to get it above 3500rpm to really let it purr. 
• The most annoying thing about the MDX is the shift mapping on the transmission. It is constantly trying to upshift prematurely, sometimes to the point that it seems something is wrong with the powertrain. I do not use mine in Drive mode; I always have it in Sportshift mode with the paddles engaged, so I have full control over when the transmission gears up. It does not turn it into a DSG or SMG, but it allows you to hold gears through turns and up hills, or gear down to prep for a highway pass. The engine has rev-matching, so it helps ease it into gear more than most automatic transmissions.
• While rated at 16/21mpg, you will rarely see better than 18mpg if you use the paddles routinely. But, this is the price of having a sufficiently powered 4,550-lb vehicle that can hit the twisties better than the majority of crossovers, and better than some sedans.
• The SH-AWD is fantastic and one of only a few torque-vectoring 4WD systems currently available. The only vehicle in the same class that has a comparable 4WD is the Audi Q7. The X5, RX350, XC90, and JX35/37 have atrocious 4WD/AWD systems that do nothing but add additional cost to the vehicle. The SH-AWD is highly advanced and is an incredible feature to have.
• Wind noise is minimal as the aerodynamics are quite good. The engineers at Honda spent a lot of time in the wind tunnel making sure this beast was comfortable at highway speeds and it’s a very comfy ride.
• If you are a performance oriented driver, definitely grab the Advance trim if you can. Additionally, look at the ATLP or RV6 J-pipe to replace the stock J-pipe. These $500 bolt-ons can add 15-25awhp, which translates into 25-40bhp. A custom CAI, resonator delete, and high-flow rear mufflers would put your output in the 340-360bhp range.

acura,mdx,2012,erperp, 06/04/2012,First Acura...Impressed!,pos,"Only few negatives to get out of the way... Coming from the German SUVs including the last one being a Cayenne, I would say the handling is on the ""comfort"" side. And the center cluster is just way too cluttered for any standard.
Nevertheless, MDX makes up with enough grunt for such a heavy car and an exceptional value, especially w tech/ent that was by far the best deal compared with any comps, including JX. Very comfortable cruiser with ample room and storage and awesome audio too. We will continue to monitor if the Acura reliability is what people say it is...."

Sadly it was also wretchedly uncomfortable.....rock hard seats, rock hard suspsension.
I'm a mom with a bad hip and back who loves to drive fast but I just couldn't take it.
So I went for my gently used MDX.
My husband has a TL that is still running great at 70K, so now we're a
two Acura family.
 I agree that build quality is certainly not up to some of the European standards.
But this should be fine for a suburban mommy mobile that might see light off road duty on easy dirt roads on scout campout weekends."
acura,mdx,2012,gibbsie, 09/18/2014,Caveat Emptor,neg,"I've had my 2012 MDX for two full years now (and 25,000 miles) and it's definitely a mixed bag.  I like the way it handles and with room for 7 or 5 and lots of gear it's certainly fit the bill of people hauler and long road trip mule, but for $45k, I expected better--better quality and reliability.  

I have driven the 2015 model and there are some improvements, but there are too many issues with this vehicle to recommend it highly.  I plan to sell it and consider other options."
acura,mdx,2012,bayman48, 04/16/2013,Not Luxury Car Quality,neu,"Its an ok car, but maybe I set my standards too high, the quality and craftsmanship compared to the germans or to even lexus is sorely lacking.
I am downright shocked, I can see carpet staples, the carpeting stops in odd places so it looks cheap, the fake wood is horrible...some hard to touch interior parts.
The service is horrible, at two dealers, one makes excuses, I point out issues and he shows me new models that have the same issues...such as a sticking glove box handle, squeaking at the b-pillar, hood plastic cushions that fall off, etc.

Outside of the relatively poor build quality and craftsmanship (clearly not built in japan mind you) its an ok car, but acura needs to improve.

Update:  Its been four years with the car...my initial review has not changed, as time wears on the car runs rougher...it revs higher and hold its too long...dealer says its normal.  Cannot wait to move on to my next vehicle, this one has been a bust.

Had to add 2.5 qts to get dip stick back up to standard level.  Since that time, have found that it takes 2.5 -3.0 qts of added oil between 5,000 miles oil changes!!  Since MDX now has 96,000 miles on it, haven't discussed issue with Acura dealer.  Note:  in addition to MDX, purchased new Lexus es 350 in 2008 which now has 200,000 miles... have never added drop of oil!!

acura,mdx,2012,Jay Cassius, 03/19/2018,IT AIN’T WHAT IT SHOULD BE !,neu,"It should sell for a lot lot less. In 2017, I bought the 2012 MDX used. 55k miles. I wanted a 3rd row SUV. Was in perfect condition, inside and out. Test drive was ok. Had only heard about Acura’s high end reputation. For the high price it must be pretty good? It ain’t. It’s not especially attractive. The dashboard and controls are pretty primitive. The buttons are cramped together, hard to read, poorly positioned. The multi information screen has  so many layers of headings and sub info that you need a special course to figure it out. Just to adjust the interior lights and door locks takes about 20 pages in the manual. Not because it’s intricate, but because it’s preprogrammed somewhere in China and they probably got the module for pennies. Like inexpensive furniture that you spend a day putting together yourself. It’s hard to get in and out. The driver seat is so high you have to lower it so your feet can get near the ground. I’m 5’10. The doors are short, too short, so you always bang your legs and feet trying to get out. You have to move the seat pretty far back so you can swing your legs out. The wood grain? panel along the dash couldn’t even pass for plastic, let alone wood. The electronic throttle is downright dangerous. You get to a highway on ramp, ease up on the gas before you accelerate....  hit the pedal.... nada... that hesitation is enough to give you a heart attack. Oh well, that’s the electronic throttle, nuttin they can do about it. I had a 2008 Lexus RX 350 before this. The MDX tries to be a cheap imitation that costs as much or more. Not even close. The 2008 Lexus was better in every way, except for the 3rd row seat. And I bet no one ever got the 16 estimated miles per gallon. I had to make a conscious effort to get 12. I’m trading it in before 6 months.

The vehicle shifts up immediately, then slows down almost to a stall, then shifts down hard, goes 20ft then shifts up again.
I was embarrassed as hell, and as soon as I can dump it I'm going to.
Don't waste your time or money.
I'm headed straight toward a real SUV like the new Yukon Denali etc...
this was a wast of time and money and reputation on Acura's part.

By contrast, the 2012 MDX was a 'boat' of an SUV.  
'Quick' is NOT in the vocabulary; underpowered comes to mind.
It's comfortable enough, and functional, but no WOW. 
The steering is 'fine' but not agile.  
The interior was light, which I like, but all I remember is monotone.

acura,mdx,2012,AZEsq, 10/09/2019,"Loved it til 100,000 miles",pos,"I'm a late LATE reviewer, but I've owned the car, which I bought gently used at 40,000 miles, for over three years. At 103,000 miles all hell broke loose. LOL. In the last 12 months, I've spent $6500 on this car +/-. We did the 100,000 mile service, which was $2500 by itself, then we were instructed that there was some obscure part that needed repair, which was $2000. Tires and oil don't count, but we've also had an alternator come up--which, FUN FACT, only ACURA alternators will work on this car. Our emergency mechanic (it died in the middle of nowhere on the 4th of July, ugh) ordered one that ""should fit"" the MDX and it does. IT works, but the stupid computer is always threatening me to ""Check charging system"" and if I'm stuck in traffic or idling or using my radio AT ALL for more than 20 minutes or so, it starts dinging at me scaring me that I'm going to be stuck on the side of the road. Honestly, I've loved the car and I'm frugal enough to know that we're keeping it, but if I could go back to 2015, I'd buy a minivan. LOL.

UPDATE: The MDX obviously (at some point) realized that we were not going to re-replace the alternator and stopped regularly dinging about the charging system. It will, however, still do so if I'm idling in traffic for a long period of time or waiting outside with the car radio on, which is not ideal. Overall, however, I still love the car. The ride, which was why I purchased it, hasn't really diminished in the last 70,000 miles. I live in DC where the potholes are aplenty. I expect a bit of a bumpy ride, but my car compared to my sister's newish Altima are night and day. It's still fairly smooth and the car has been really easy to maintain since the debacle last summer. Considering that we drive it at best 3 times a week now that could be contributing to my joy with it. Honestly, now that I take metro almost everywhere, I have no impetus to buy a new car any time soon. But I still get the itch. And every time it comes up, the MDX is still at the top of the list!

There are duplicate buttons for every on screen function. In other words, navigation screen and the functions available there including audio are a duplicate of existing buttons resulting in cluttered dashboard.
Rearview camera is cheap and has poor resolution. Doesn't work well in dark and during rain. Almost monochrome. Wish the side mirrors could be folded from inside. Its a wide SUV and I need to fold the mirrors to park it inside the garage."

acura,mdx,2013,AmithW, 11/23/2015,BEST SUV IN THE CALSS,pos,"I always buy less than 2 yr old cars. Due to high mileage driving(25K/yr) I cannot lease. I compared the BMW X5, MDX, Lexus RX 350, and Benz GL class. After loads of research and test driving it was easy to zero in on the final 2 of RX 350 and MDX. MDX won due to following. Exceptional road handling over RX 350. Killer looks to match the Road handling. Excellent acceleration combined with the growl from under the hood makes you feel like a F1 race driver. And finally I only saw 5 star user reviews for MDX. I have now clocked 45000 miles in 2 years. (No major repairs only maintenance so far) Still feel like a kid getting into it every morning. Feels good to drive it knowing it will not fail me and give me the best driving experience. I just returned from the 2016 LA Auto show and realized my MDX is still so very good. I do get 17.5mpg combined. Highly, highly recommend this car. I wish Acura continued with the same or higher powered engines for the 2016 and up models. I strongly feel when one's willing to pocket out $60K price tag 2 or 3 mpg shouldn't be an issue. I shall have mine for 2 more years and hopefully by then Acura will come up with a higher hp MDX...
"
acura,mdx,2013,Anonymous, 08/14/2016,Satisfied with my Purchase,pos,"I purchased my 2013 MDX in April of 2016 as a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle. I researched the vehicle for about 5 months before finally making a purchase, I wanted to make sure I was buying a reliable vehicle since the car I traded in for the Acura was less than reliable. While I am overall very satisfied with my purchase the MDX did fall short in a few areas, at least for the 2013 year, there is no push button ignition, backup camera is very blurry and useless at night, and the vehicle likes to shift out of first gear very quickly which can be aggravating instantly losing that power(shifts at about 2200 RPM, would be smoother shifting around the 3000 RPM point), I also don't like the lever release for the parking brake, I'm use to ""push to release"" parking brakes, but it's no big deal. With those 4 complaints though, the MDX makes up for it in other areas. For starters, it runs great, there is no shortage of power and the engine has an amazing sound running through the RPMs. The vehicle also handles like a dream, you can take it on a mountain road and not feel like it's going to tip over or that you need to crawl up the mountain. Of course the appearance is what first caught my attention to consider the MDX, I have received nothing but compliments from coworkers and friends over the way the vehicle looks, it has a very aggressive front and rear end. The stereo is also amazing, while I could stand it to be a little louder at times, most people are not going to have an issue at all. I also get decent gas mileage, I average around 20 MPG, given the size and horsepower I don't consider that bad at all, although requiring premium gas does make that number a little irrelevant spending at least 50 cents more per gallon at the pump than a rival running on regular. One issue that has been prevalent since I purchased the car has been a vibration that comes and goes, after changing 2 of the tires it went away then came back a few weeks later, running the car to 5500 RPM completely eliminated the vibration, now only a slight vibration shows up on rare occasions and goes away shortly after. I have also noticed complaints about bearings going bad fairly quickly on the MDX, I have an appointment soon to check a slight roaring noise that I believe may be one of the bearings. Overall though, i would recommend the vehicle to anyone.

It’s reliable and I got a great deal on this used SUV two years ago.  You keep up with the maintenance and it will not let you down.  It’s got good room for passengers and stuff.  The far rear seats are a bit tight,but it’s very rear we use them. Other than that, this is a great vehicle.

acura,mdx,2013,Jean Hale, 05/19/2018,love but a few problems some chronic,pos,"We bought this as a certified used car from a dealer at 9mo old and very low miles.  PROS:  Very comfortable especially for my taller husband, most switches in easy reach, manipulation of back seats very easy, lots of cargo room, peppy engine for larger SUV, grips the road very well.     CONS:  Very noisy cab- lots of road noise and wind noise.  Burnt smell occasionally coming from circulation vents- mechanics have not been able to source it so not fixed over almost 6 years of ownership.  Controls on steering wheel not intuitive.  Climate control difficult and not real efficient.  Of the 2 USB ports, one quit working after a year (front of console).  Biggest and most dangerous issue was an issue with electronics; warning lights would come on, often several, radio lights would come on, engine would speed up and not be under normal control (this was after a year of ownership, still under warranty).  This progressed to multiple attempts to start (warning lights all on and acting like dead battery).  Would get jumps to start, bought a new battery and the car would still be difficult.  Became dangerous to drive so was hauled to dealer by tow truck.  Dealer attempted a repair that was not successful and car died again when out of town.  Dealer tried to fix again and was unsuccessful- could not find issue.  Finally had a relative who was a mechanic tell us about a Honda recall on electrical issues and steering column electronics.  Had dealer do the fix for the Honda issue and this fixed the problem.  Look up related Honda issues for Acura issues.

acura,mdx,2013,Former Acura Fan, 11/26/2019,Buyer beware. High repair bills ahead,neg,"I bought my MDX for the reliability, thinking I would drive it well into 200,000 miles. Unfortunately, at just over 100,000 miles, the check engine light came on. 10 weeks and $10,000 later, I got my car back with engine rebuilt. Luckily, I found an independent mechanic. I can't imagine how much the dealer would have charged for this repair. The worst part about this is Acura knew about this issue in 2013 and issued a Technical Service Bulletin (web search for: TSB 13-024). They refused to take any ownership in the issue or offset the repair costs in anyway. 

I can not recommend that any one purchase this vehicle or any other Acura for that matter. 

Here's an excerpt from the TSB: ""The cylinder bore may be out of round, causing low compression.
CORRECTIVE ACTION: Inspect the vehicle and, if necessary, replace the engine block.""

Had a 2012 RDX and the MDX is far better.

Acura dealers discounting due to coming 2014 model can result in a very attractive deal."
acura,mdx,2013,Ex-Acura Owner, 03/02/2020,Acura - Never Again,neg,"We owned a 2007 MDX which was a great SUV.  Drove it on a trip out west to see the National Parks, 8,000 miles and it never used a drop of oil.  In 2013, we gave it to our son and bought a 2013 MDX.  We thought the last year of a model would be the best, all bugs worked out - wrong.  It consumed oil from the time it left the lot.  We took it to dealers in NC, MD and MA.  They all said that using a qt. in 1,000 miles was acceptable.  We only used it on long trips so a consumption test was difficult to do.  We ended up extending the warranty for 5 yrs. and 70,000 miles.  We knew the engine wasn't reliable long term.  We carried several qts. of oil in the car with disposable funnels and filled it back up when it needed it, usually around 1,000 miles.  We just traded it in with 91,000 miles.  We received the notice of the class action suit against Honda/Acura over the situation and figured we'd never get rid of it once the word spread.  Acura did extend the warranty for the issue but from what we read, it is difficult to get them to work on the engine and even replaced blocks leak oil.  We loved the handling and comfort.  It felt safe.  But, Acura blew it on the engine and they refused to acknowledge the problem promptly and the recourse isn't satisfactory.  Would never consider an Acura again.

acura,mdx,2013,Jon M-, 03/06/2017,Sport Ute that Leans Towards Sport,pos,"So I’ve had this SUV for a little over 2 1/2 years now.  Performance is still terrific.  Been having some issues with front brakes/front end.  Replaced rotors/pads still some front end shake on braking.  Still have vibration that developed about 9 months ago in front end at 75-85 MPH.  Dealer can’t seem to sort it out.  Aside from these issues it’s still a very comfortable vehicle.  I’ve put about 20K on odometer.  Aside from maintenance any other issues have been covered by the CPO warranty.  Gas mileage is terrible unless you baby the throttle, but it’s also a performance SUV.  Some of the trim and the headlights are starting to show some age.  Overall it’s been a great vehicle over the past 2 plus years.  If I can work out the bugs before the CPO Warranty expires I’ll probably hold onto it.  If not might trade in for something larger as our needs have changed since purchased.  Might look into a pre 2018 Expedition EL or Suburban.

Update 9/14/19....  I traded in the MDX.  I now drive a 2019 Ram 1500 Classic crew cab hemi.  I couldn’t get the front end straightened out and it was bugging me.  The ram is actually quieter riding and gets better gas mileage.  Ha!!!  The MDX will still put a smile on your face in the twisties.

acura,mdx,2013,Sean , 11/01/2020,Stunning,pos,"I have owned my 2013 MDX since December of 2012. I have logged over 140k miles.  No complaints.  Phenomenal care.  One time the door actuator wouldnt lock the rear passenger door and I had to lock it manually, but that was an easy and cheap fix.  Tires and oil. I have absolutely no complaint.  Highly recommended cars.  I've convinced my two brothers to get MDX. I would like to see MDX stick to only 4wd, but I assume some dont want it. Newer models Hybrids improve power but not really MPG.  All in all, I recommend but then again I havent owned another car in 8 years, maybe there are better than out there.

acura,mdx,2013,love2drive111, 02/09/2013,Acura MDX Review,pos,"I recently bought a brand new Acura MDX and I am a satisfied customer. The primary reason I purchased this car was that it was a gift for my
mother and I believed it fit her style, a blend of luxury and accomplishment. Driving impressions of this vehicle were satisfying as the ride is very sleek, you can hardly feel a bump on the road. The ride is almost too relaxing as if you were on auto pilot in a commercial aircraft. The vehicle is extremely fun especially in the rain, as its suspension is highly tuned for safety. Seeing other MDX vehicles on the road is definitely an eye catcher because of limited ownership. If you have the means of 50k I highly recommend it.

My overall driving habits fall around 65% highway, 35% city, and I currently average a total of

23.9 MPG.
After 22,000 miles on my 2012 MDX, the best I was able to achieve was 18.6 MPG, so this is a huge improvement. Many of us have seen reviews with significant MPG stated -here's why.
The 2014 has a robust online computer that not only provides total MPG, but per trip MPG as well.
I drove from Central NJ to Newark, Delaware twice last week (78 miles each way, 80% highway, 20% city) and averaged 30.9 and 30.7 MPG on each trip, which is impressive for this type of vehicle."
acura,mdx,2014,tmariner, 03/14/2014,Even better! A keeper!,pos,"Moved up to the 2014 from a 2011 MDX. Looks similar, but big perceptual difference.

I can select the Sport mode and make the MDX handle like the 2011 3.7 liter, but normally luxuriate in the ""normal"" mode with handling and silence. The twin screen dash still befuddles my wife, but as a techie big step up -- and I have the ""base"" model without all the goodies.

Great acceleration, but more silent and refined. Tons of detail improvements to numberous to list.

If you're in the market for an SUV, either step up to or step sideways into this car! I mistakenly leased it -- a reasonable deal, but they will probably have to pry this thing out of my cold, dead hands."

Dealer duplicated motor noise on 4th visit. Corporate tech advised dealer ""they're aware of ""issue"" with steering motor, but don't have any solution at this time"". Dealer advised car ""normal"" and I should pick it up!! Problem without solution=no repair? What could happen if the steering wheel locks up again?
If you have this problem Please file your complaint immediately with National Highway Safety Administration 888-327-4236. BTW dealer said rattle windows is as per Acura design. Really?
 More than two years into the lease I became aware through a blog that there was a service bulletin sent to all Acura service centers. Neither of the Acura dealers that I visited 10 times to fix the noise alerted me that there was a fix. When I made an appointment to have 10 plastic clips that secure the plastic shroud under the hood I was given a very hard time before they fixed the problem explaining to me that it was not s recall!

acura,mdx,2014,dantl, 01/31/2014,Complete junk!,neg,"My MDX has been in the shop more than I had the car since I bought it 2 months ago.
A handful of owners, including myself, have had issues with the warning lights for various vehicle systems (i.e. lane departure warning, front collision warning, SH-AWD, Traction Control, etc) coming on for no reason and when that occurs, these systems do not work.

The car has been to the dealer 3 times for the same issue and most recently, they only reset the computer and gave me the vehicle back so I can test it out to see if the problem happens again.

This is my 4th and last Acura.
My prior 3 Acura vehicles were reliable and thatÂs why I came back for a 4th one."
acura,mdx,2014,Jim G, 09/06/2016,Still Disappointed With My 2014 MDX,neg,"This is an update to my previous reviews of my 2014 MDX.  I now have 65K miles on my vehicle, but I've never had a vehicle with more problems in my life.  It's a good thing I bought the extended warranty, but it's still a pain to have to deal with constant problems.  In my last review I wrote that I took my vehicle in to fix the stuttering at acceleration and it took two visits before they could diagnose the problem, which was a software bug.  Acura engineering was addressing the bug, so the temporary fix was to replace the transmission fluid, which did work.  However, it's now almost 2 years later and Acura has not completed the software fix, so I had to have the transmission fluid replaced again.  To make things worse, the Acura Service manage told me the MDX transmission is no longer the same as in my model year (and they're changing again), so it's doubtful that this transmission issue will ever be resolved.  Additionally, the vehicle has issues with the steering wheel grinding when it retracts, the trunk release is still intermittent, the navigation system send me to restaurants on the east coast even though I live in California, blah, blah, blah.  I can't wait to get rid of this vehicle, and I'll never buy an Acura or Honda again.

acura,mdx,2014,lbjr51, 07/03/2014,Beware of noise (VCM or modulator?),neu,"This car is comfortable to drive other than the fact that one must put up with an irritating noise that Acura refuses to fix (5 in all categories otherwise). Some have described the noise as being similar to ""a cell phone in vibrate mode going off on a hard surface."" My understanding is the noise is identified as being from the Variable Cylinder Management System (VCM) switching from 3 cylinders to 6 cylinders. Unfortunately, the noise gets louder over time. Acura contends it is the all wheel drive unit modulator activating.
It apparently is also noted on other Honda models like the RDX, Pilot and Odyssey. At the minimum, Acura's dealers should be required to disclose this issue."

Gets loud at >50mph.   I took it in, dealer says it is a known problem for which Acura hasn't put a fix out for.   They didn't want to try putting in rubber tape, etc and start messing with the window fit perhaps making things worse.  Recommended I wait and see if Acura puts out a fix.   Are you kidding me.. $55K for a loud noise in your ear.    Not a sign of quality to compete with rivals.   Stay away.  "
acura,mdx,2014,jedi4knight, 04/26/2014,Build quality is poor for a premium SUV,neu,"2014 MDX is a huge deal for Acura as over 40% of revenue comes from MDX sales but the overall execution is poor. First issue is not necessarily a bad design, but build quality of SUV that is made in America. If this SUV were built better, there would be a lot less complaint and more appraises but unfortunately, it does not represent a premium SUV class at all. Overall cost cutting also shows how much Acura cut material cost to save money in several areas for loyal Acura owners will realize rather quickly. After first three months and 2400 miles later, the ultimate question remains. Will you buy this SUV again? My answer would be ""probably not"" I have owned many Acura but this is the worst. "

Acceleration is smooth and steering feel is excellent...drove the RX too but, MDX sportier handling much more fun...very roomy 2nd seat with new push button slide ...cargo area gives me all I need. Having only 2 option packages from Base forces losing desirable options like heated rear seats, folding rear view mirrors, remote start, parking sensors, better insulation, better leather, etc without paying $8K more for Advance pkg and then you get 16.2 in DVD screen, 22.8 mpg on first tank."

Made an appointment with the purchasing dealer only to have them tell me it needed tires.(21,000 miles) and alignment. Could not find the noises. Said if I came back and purchased a set of new tires $1300.00 they would look at it some more. Talked to Acura about this and they said it was a dealer issue and I would have to take care of it by working it out with the dealer. What happened to my warranty?? No more Acura's for me.

We have had a lot of winter weather lately and the MDX does great on snow and ice.
We are pleased with fuel economy for a vehicle this large.
This is my wife's car primarily and she drives like she's running from the law - still averaging about 22 mpg in mix of city/highway.
Only complaint is that touchscreen seems difficult to use as compared to simply having a knob or a switch.
But all cars seem to be going the touch screen direction.
Also wish Acura didn't do quite so much bundling of packages.

One of the tech parts I most love is the ACC and LKAS, this is basically a self driving car, a small touch to the weel from time to time is the only thing you have to do.

Acura is aware of it and they do not plan on fixing it.
I have driven other vehicles with fuel saving systems, and you don't hear or feel it switching cylinders.

As a semi BMW loyalist, I went to look at the X5 to replace my Suburban and share garage space with my M Roadster and 7 series. The Suburban is too big now that the kids are grown, but the X5 was too small. I then proceeded to drive several of the other luxury SUV's (Lexus, Infinity, Mercedes, and Acura) and the MDX stands out in every category I saw important. It was close to the X5 in handling and better in ride (It blew the others away in both). Acceleration is strong and braking is quick and reliable. 2nd seat leg room rivals the 7 series.

The only time I ever actually enjoy the console is the week after I take it for service and get hit for $300 bucks. The other 90% of the time the tire pressure and service lights are constantly on. It reminds me of my printer that never works because it's constantly trying to make you buy new toner instead of just working.

acura,mdx,2014,hhhjjj, 02/25/2014,Diappointed and mislead,neu,"We purchased a 2014 Acura MDX 2WD. It has a harsh and noisy ride over bumps. This is due to the light suspension and the light rear end. If you accept more bounce and are indifferent to thumping noises you will be OK. Our dealer suggested riding around with a 50lb bag of dog food to help quieten. Also, notice the resistance when the engine downshifts. Our biggest objection is the Dealer, Gary Force Acura in Brentwood Tennessee, mislead us by putting us in an AWD model for our two test drives. We thought we were buying a much smoother and quiet vehicle. Either way, I would not recommend this vehicle. Based on price you can do much better purchasing another vehicle. "

Everything else worked extremely well.
The vibration caused me to purchase a 2013 Lexus RX 350 which was a quieter and smoother riding although smaller.
We recently checked out a 2014 MDX and were blown away by the improvement in ride and road noise.

Stereo issue remains. Sometimes when the iPod is plugged in and I try to change from one playlist to another, it puts up a message: ""Generating voice recognition commands...""

We keep the 3rd row seats folded down for more room. It's a very roomy cabin and

Fortunately, my dog and I were not injured, although the SUV sustained considerable damage.  The airbags did not deploy because the other vehicle hit the passenger side of my windshield and structural support pillar.  Did over $14,000 of damage.  I had no time to react.

I added the following options; towing pkg, fog lights, roof rails and cross bars, mud flaps, and rear bumper protector. I felt they added a lot to the style as well as some function. This car is primarily my wife's car. She says it is the most comfortable car she has ever driven or ridden in. Good gas mileage for this class vehicle, however the 91 octane fuel requirement over regular cuts down on any fuel savings. I was concerned about the variable cylinder management system, which Acura used to get the 28 mpg. I was pleasantly surprised, no noticeable delays or lack of power. Most cars of this class get improved gas mileage  via CV or 9 speed transmissions, the 2014 did not. Strangely enough the 2015 model did come with a different tranny, however it did not seem to improve mpg.
The only real gripes are with the navigation and the radio display. The navigation locks you out on many functions while moving (safety) however it is frustrating (when passenger cannot input address or search for points of interest). My VW warns you but allows all functions. The GPS display does not provide the posted speed limit like my $100 Garman portable or my VW Touareg GPS. The radio screen is huge but truncates song/artist info beyond so many characters, go figure.

acura,mdx,2014,David C. Laredo, 09/01/2015,Poor Customer Service - I will NEVER buy another!,neg,"As an owner of an Acura MDX I must express my extreme disappointment with Acura's customer service (and lack thereof!).  The dealer from whom I bought my car lost its contract with Acura.  (This can happen.)  BUT... Acura never contacted me to advise as to where I should take the vehicle for warranty work.  

The nearest Acura dealer is a 2 hour (one way) drive for me, but an certified Honda dealer is only 10 minutes away.

Acura now sent me a recall notice informing me a bolt needs to be replaced.  The Honda dealer tells me they can do the work, but Acura will cover and authorize this work only with prior authorization.  Acura denied authorization, which thus required me to undertake a 4 hour round trip to effect this recall.  Oh... and it took Acura 4 weeks and multiple calls on my part to decide my request to deal with the Honda dealer would be denied.  Never once did Acura return my call.

Oh.  Acura did send me a letter to wish me a ""Happy Anniversary"" in recognition of my Acura Ownership.

Based upon their lack of caring, and lack of responsiveness, I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ACURA!

As a postscript, the Pearl White paint blistered & peeled - and while covered under warranty, this AGAIN forced me to make TWO 4-hour return trips to get the work done.  And now the cover-glass (plastic?) for both headlights has major fogging.  Guess who needs to make another 4-hour return trip to get this done... when my friendly Honda dealership is once again available to do the same a mere 5 minutes from my home.

acura,mdx,2014,bgf18, 02/09/2014,Acura Venza,neu,"Overall, we are seriously disappointed. We made the mistake of trading in our 2011 MDX for a 2014 before we had a chance to live with it. Acura has, unfortunately, transitioned the MDX from being an SUV to a minivan-shaped SUV, much like the Toyota Venza. The vehicle is shorter, fatter, and longer. If you need or want an SUV-shaped minivan, then this is the vehicle for you. Also, if you like navigating touch-screen menus while trying to stay on the road, you'll love the new MDX."
acura,mdx,2014,VP, 09/15/2015,Acura is not worth leasing or buying,neg,"Update:  After driving leased Acura MDX for 3 years, I was very happy to return it to the dealer even before my lease expired.  Not a good car at all.  Eats gas, poor performance, transmission problems.  I am driving Acura RDX now and its not a good car either. THUS, Acura is not a good car, do not waste your money on it!
I leased new Acura MDX in 2014 after driving it for 18 month, I am extremely unsatisfied with its performance.
The engine is lacking in power, the car jumps at 20mph and 40mph points and stoles and shakes, so  speed changes are very palpable inside the car. It also lacks in performance as it’s almost impossible to get the speed to 80mph. There are noises from the front and sides of the car every time the speed is over 40mph and they increase with speed.
Break safety feature works at its own whim and beeps at any time, no matter if there are cars in front or if road is completely deserted. Lane departure feature is unusable, when its on, it beeps all the time and distracts from driving. Multi-view rear camera does not have all necessary angles to maneuver safely in a tight spot, it is too high and not a wide angle.
However, absolutely unacceptable is the way audio system and navigations system work, or more accurately – don’t work.  It’s a shame that car that costs more than some homes do has such a poorly designed and obviously malfunctioning navigation and audio systems.  Navigation gps, if able to find an address at all, which happens 5 out of 10 times, will show you the longest route, if to the correct place at all.  The directions end about 400 ft away from the address and you are left guessing about your final destination all the time. The gps screen is very user unfriendly and when you enter the city it “helps” you by showing you cities that start with the same letters you typed all over the US. Many times it cannot find the street or the house number on the street. Gps cannot be updated without spending additional $200 every year and it is about 10 years behind even on a new car, so any road or development built after 2005 will not be found by this gps.
The good navigation system in the car was one of my main requirements when I was signing a new lease, because I use it for work, and I was assured by dealer that this is the car with best gps in the marketplace.  I am ashamed every day to use it in front of clients because in most cases it will either take me to a different address, cannot find address at all, or directs me to drive 16 miles in a roundabout way when my destination is located 2-3 miles away. The features to find a place by name or by category usually show places that are on the other side of the country. If I am searching for closest coffee shop or gas station, it will usually direct me to KY or NJ, and I am in FL. You cannot find an airport by name or address or any other popular venue by name at all.
Audio system does not work with blackberry phone, it does not transfer contracts, interferes with audio and navigation when linked to a phone, and changes settings automatically without me re-setting the system.  There were so many times when after a phone call I was not able to disconnect, or not able to pick up a call at all, or the panel screen would freeze on the phone disconnect screen and would not switch back to navigation.  Many other features do no work at all, but I have no use for them anyway. When talking on the phone,  navigation sound increase so that you do not hear the person you are talking to. The voice recognition does not work, the voice dial does not work, I stopped using Bluetooth function completely because it interferes more than it was ever useful. So the second main feature why I leased this car is also not working, and creates a danger on the road when I have to hold the phone instead of being able to use a Bluetooth.
Overall, I am completely dissatisfied with the
 car functionality and features. I asked the dealer to help, but if system does not work, it does not work, there is not much the dealer can do.  
I went to a dealer and asked him to exchange my car before expiration of the lease because it makes no sense to be paying over $550 a month for a car with features that don’t work and create problems for me.  I wanted to get out of this lease and switch to Acura RDX without the crazy navigation and audio systems, just a basic car that drives (hopefully).  But I was told that there is no way I can change the car until the end of the lease term. So my understanding of the situation is that car does not hold value and it makes no sense for company to buy it back.  I send a letter to the Acura headquarters, and after a long conversation was told that they cannot help because every dealership is doing their own thing and the dealership only can make a decision to exchange the car.  I advised both the headquarters and the dealership that I will use all available social media to share my experience with Acura.

acura,mdx,2014,johnkim575, 07/12/2014,no spare tire!,neu,"Be warned that there is no spare tire on some models.
I found out the hard way that Acura has put in a tire inflator/gel rather than a spare tire.
What should have been a 15 minute tire change turned out into a 5 hours ordeal where Acura wanted me to have the car towed to a dealership because the puncture on my tire was larger than ""nail"" size. 
What would have happened if I was on a road trip with no acura dealership near by because Acura road side service will only tow to an Acura dealership?
If you don't tow to a dealership YOU pay to have it towed.
A car that nearly costs 50K should have a spare tire/donut."
acura,mdx,2014,deannie, 10/06/2013,Handling + Braking + MPG = Great Car,pos,"Wow.
I expected excellent fuel economy, but I did not expect to regularly exceed the mpg rating.
Light throttle at 60-70 mph = 30-32 mpg.
This is HYBRID-LIKE fuel economy!

Make no mistake, handling and braking are crucial to active safety, and this car has it.
It was upsetting, though, to have to opt for the tech pkg in order to get the 19"" wheels/lower profile tires which make tech pkg cars handle and brake marginally better than those non-tech-equipped.

Short people MUST test-drive before buying.
My 5'2"" wife BARELY found a suitable driving position.

Love the side mirrors reverse-tilt feature, but prefer both mirrors tilt down when in reverse, not just one."

acura,mdx,2014,heather52, 06/29/2013,Front Seat,neu,"If you are vertically challenged this is not the car for you. I test drove the 2013, seat adjusted fine. The 2014 is a whole different story. The front seat does not adjust to where a more petite person like myself can see adequately to drive it. Something to be aware of. My new suv is now my husband's. When ordering in the 2014 I never thought that this would be a factor."
acura,mdx,2014,icern, 06/13/2014,Good SUV but Can be better,pos,"Before i purchased the MDX, i test drove other SUV in or near this 7 seater class. From Explorers, Qx60 and Highlander etc. But it came down to two. The infiniti or the Accura. I went with the MDX. For the reason that it is more enjoyable to drive. Good suspension on minor bumps although the Adv Tech seems to be quiter that the other trims.
It has A good Gas Mileage. I get 22 to 24 MPG Combined with more Bostonian/suburb driving than highway. The Interior does not feel cheap at all. Although the Center console looks outdated. It has pretty cool features like the flood lights and interior lighting are LED's. Safety is also good"
acura,mdx,2014,Bob, 05/17/2018,I expected a Lot!,pos,"When I purchased this vehicle I expected a lot from it .... and l got it! It iss truly a pleassure to drive and economical to own and operate. When Itake to the highway I have a heavy foot so averageing 80 -85 of more mph if normal. And the vehicle rides like I am doing 45 - 50 mph, the ridel is smooth, controled and I average 26+ mpg. In the city I drop down to 21 -23 mpg which is still not bad at all. I have owned the MDX since November of 2013 and with the exception of routine scheduled maintance I have not had to spend a dime on repairs. Another positve is the room and confort of the interior which is very nice when you are on those long trips. The only negative I can ssay about my MDX is wind noise on the highway. But believe me, with all the pluses the MDX offers it is easy to overlook that minor problem. When I think back to the other SUV I test drove before I purchased the MDX I am so glad that I made the decision to go with the Acura.

acura,mdx,2014,buchem, 11/10/2013,Unacceptable noises,neg,"Soon after delivery we took a long road trip. Would have been enjoyable with great comfort but trip was ruined by dashboard rattles and intermittent grating noise under light acceleration. After three trips to dealer the dash noises are less but not eliminated and are judged to be ""normal"". Not in $50K car. Worse is the grating noise. Dealer says it is a ""known issue"" with no known cause or solution. I know the 2014 model is a total redesign butt his is just unacceptable. All I can say to potential buyers is avoid this car. Acura is selling cars with a known issue and not currently able to fix them. We are very unhappy customers. "
acura,mdx,2014,David S, 01/21/2016,Nice highway suv,pos,"The mdx drives like a sedan on the highway. Comfortably and very quiet.  Surprisingly good gas mileage for a full size vehicle.
"
acura,mdx,2014,mogulz, 08/26/2013,"Better than its predecessor, but not perfect.",pos,"The '14 MDX is a driving experience different from the '13.  In comfort mode, it drives like a Lexus RX300.  In sport mode the suspension and steering tightens up and it drives stiffer than a '13 MDX.  'Normal' mode is a happy medium.  Power is still impressive and smooth especially when you remember it is only 290 horsepower.  Acura claims it is faster than the '13.  Getting in and out of the back seats, including the third row is a breeze.  Mileage is excellent for a vehicle this size.  I'll get at least 26mpg on the highway - maybe 28 on summer blend gas.  Around town has been closer to 18.  My complaints about the car are minor.  Visibility through the C and D pillars is not good.  In fact, since 2013 we have had two minor bumper scuffs with roadside posts that were not seen when backing up.  You really need the back up camera to see what is behind you and the Acura/Honda camera is not great, especially at night.  The technology in the stereo, navigation, bluetooth, etc is impressive, but not intuitive.  I have had to flip through the manual on several occasions to do something I had thought should have been elementary.  Some simple tasks like changing the fan speed require two or three inputs.  I guess a complaint about the '13 was that it had too many buttons and knobs.  This car has two few.  The old system with a simple knob for a specific function was better.   Also, the car deactivates some sophisticated NAV and music features and requires you to use voice commands when driving, which can be MADDENING when the voice recognition misunderstands.  But there are workarounds.  Acura/Honda really needs to update this system.  The new cars appear to have the same two screen system as my 2014 model.  Year seven with the vehicle and there have been two maintenance issues out of warranty.  Spent about $1700 total.  Overall I am still pleased with this purchase, but I would not buy a new MDX unless I was certain the infotainment tech was completely new.
"
acura,mdx,2014,bohlson, 09/04/2013,Great except.....,pos,After driving a Chevy Suburban for 18 years I am loving the smaller car with its handling and better gas mileage. I purchased the MDX over the competitors because of the reputation for reliability and because I found it more comfortable than the other cross overs. My one complaint though is that when I open the sunroof I get the smell of burnt rubber or something that immediately comes in the car. At first I thought it was sucking in exhaust but I think the smell is coming up the windshield and into the car. The dealership said it is the smell of the new engine and that after 4-5K miles it will go away but I am not sure. 2k miles and it still does it. Anyone else experiencing this smell???
acura,mdx,2014,johnra, 08/23/2014,Love my MDX but would hesitate to buy again,pos,"This is a great family car with plenty of room, power, fuel efficiency, safety features, and style.
For these reasons I am very happy with my purchase.
However, there are enough quirks that I would hesitate to buy an MDX again.
There is an odd noise the car makes when shifting from 3 to 6 cylinders; the lumbar adjustments on the front driver seat are too limited; sound quality from the radio is pathetic; and I have heard awful things about the in car nav (thankfully I did not waste my money on this).
All cars have quirks but these are too many for a car in this price range.
I get the sense Acura rushed this out the door - a lesson learned for me in buying the first year of a new model."
acura,mdx,2014,Nan, 10/15/2018,Not as happy with this model,neg,"I purchased the 2014 MDX new and have been the only driver -- just now has a little over 20K miles (the little 'ol lady owner joke :-)  Anyway, I too had the squeal of the steering column whenever the temps were hot or cold.  It took several trips to the dealer (which is a long drive from my home) before the column would make the noise for the service department techs -- service department finally acknowledged they'd had others with the same problem. Now 2 yrs later, steering feels like something is loose and so now back to the dealer I go.  I'm very disappointed in the braking system. The rotors are bad.  It is disappointing I have to have those worked on since the car does not get driven much/brakes aren't used much (no issues with my 2011).  I'm disappointed I cannot use car play because honda won't/can't offer a software update for ""older models"". I don't like the touch screen and the voice recognition works only when it wants to (my 2011 has this same problem), and sometimes the Bluetooth for phone goes crazy and won't recognize my phone.   I purchased this MDX because I own a 2011 MDX and am pleased with it.  It too has low miles. It is used in mountain driving and handles superbly in the snow, down the mountain, etc.  Will keep the 2011 but looking at the Subaru Ascent to replace the 2014 MDX.   I'm sure there are other small issues with the 2014 that I'm not remembering now.  Maybe I just got a lemon.

Heading west on a sunny day produced a significant amount of glare off the aluminum trim around the center console and the entertainment center.It was so distracting and bothersome to the driver that we had to cover the trim with articles of clothing.Dealership was notified their solution was to cover with electrical tape. Acura client relations was contacted their response was thx for feedback, no solution because its the design of the interior for the MDX.No other model has that reflective trim!Stay away,there r
many other competitive choices.I will solve it with ""DUCT TAPE"" :("
acura,mdx,2014,nukem4ever, 05/16/2014,I Don't get all the negatives,pos," (AWD with tech and RES package) I have put 14000 miles on it so far, I drive a lot on highways and I find very little to dislike about it. It is a very quiet car, with a great transmission with perfectly in-tune shifting, it has fairly good acceleration. Sure it is a new model and some folks are going to have bear with the fact that new models will have some issues but those will most likely be ironed out easily. Honda makes excellent engines and the one in this car is no exception, I have driven this car almost daily for about a year and couldn't be happier, but I guess you have to drive it to appreciate how great the ride is"
acura,mdx,2014,Smokejumper, 11/23/2015,Just Dumped it,neg,"This was our third MDX, and the last.  Unfortunately, they got progressively worse.  We had a 2004 that was great for nearly 10 years.  We bought a second in 2007 which was different, but fine.  An accident with the 2007 left it with electrical issues that the Acura dealership couldn't fix after a dozen trips in so we got rid of it.  I immediately bought a 2014 without really looking around - what a mistake.  
-The transmission and breaking are horrible.  
-The navigation system performs less reliably than my iPhone maps app.  
-The voice command system is completely worthless.
-The seats are among the least comfortable I've been in.

Overall, the 2014 MDX would be a disappointment at a price point 10K under what it sells for.  I dumped it after 20K miles.  Goodbye, Acura.

I lean more towards Tech than pampering in my cars so I'm all in.

The build quality and fit and finish was so bad that even after two dealer service visits, many items are still unacceptable. Based on the build quality alone, Acura is no longer a premium car manufacturer. The design and engineering of the technology package is not user friendly and certainly not intuitive. Losing the weather information is a major backward step. The noise from the injectors, the noise from the steering wheel, the noise from the lift cylinder are unacceptable. The dealer says these are ""just the way it is on this vehicle."" I have 3000 miles on this vehicle and I am looking to trade. I am really disappointed in Acura.

At that point, the seal is popping out.
Looks ugly and water can get inside.


I examined all three 2014 MDXs on the dealership lot, they all had this same issue. Dealership doesn't know how to fix it, and Honda Canada is asking the design engineer in U.S. 

THe 2013 & 2012 MDX have the same 30 degree angle, but no such problem.

Going to golf courses, going to Big Box stores, picking up and toting gardening supplies, flowers, plants, small trees and shrubs. Very adaptable. Very reliable. Very comfortable. Then, a flat tire. Had to replace two original tires, Continentals, with two Firestone tires. Now the vehicle has annoying, maybe serious, vibrations. Firestone has checked their tires, the alignment, etc. Vibrations still occur at 65 to 75 mph. Can the car be blamed for this problem, getting a flat tire? Can the tire manufacturers be blamed? 
Acura dealership serviced the MDX, changed oil, rotated tires, balanced and aligned wheels, and the car travels like brand new. Service at local Firestone shop was the problem. Not too good.

I drive a BMW and this has never happened, not once.
We live in Chicago and I was really upset.
The dealership didn't provide an explanation, they blamed the washer fluid not the car.
There is a fault with the tank and the nozzle.
If you live in cold climate, please avoid this purchase.
Look into a Toyota or if you can afford it, step up to a German car.
You can get good deals on CPO BMW and Mercedes. "

This SUV is an amazing highway cruiser and family hauler when it's not in the garage for electronic issues. My vehicle has been in the garage for multiple two-week periods trying to fix an electrical issue and now the newest issue is the keyless entry/start system doesn't work.  I can't even unlock the doors without removing the key from the fob, and I have to hold the fob next to the button just to start the car (even then you wonder if it will work).  I have rattles, knocks, and electronic issues that you would expect from a $15K car but not from a luxury brand.  I want to like this car, I really do."
acura,mdx,2015,Michal, 12/08/2015,GPS sucks!,neu,"I had great expectations for this car and it has been a great disappointment. Driving experience is excellent, comfy, well responsive, good visibility to the front. Poor visibility to the back when parking. Infotainment is big mess. I find using my i-phone more than car's features, because it takes so much time to enter or find any Point of interest from Acura database which is extremely poor or algorithms for searching are poorly designed. Acura owns apology to all owners for this mess and perhaps free update to fix it. It is also very slow in response and user experience requires numerous endless clicks to get to anything. I prefer hands down my GPS in 10 year old Honda Pilot EX than this new Acura. It seems that a lot of owners are furious over this infotainment fiasco. I really want to love this vehicle but in the future I will definitely look more closely at many other brands before buying another Acura.
"
acura,mdx,2015,CORunner, 08/13/2015,Huge disappointment!,neg,"I have owned my 2015 MDX for about 8 months so far. I have tried to love it, or even like it, but I cannot. I traded in my 2008 MDX after six years of loyal service to “upgrade” to the new model. That was a big mistake.

The 2008 MDX was a great car and I loved it from the day that I bought it. It wasn’t perfect, but it was good at almost everything. The 2015 was a hassle starting on the day I drove it home. It was raining really hard outside, so we did most of the deal looking at the showroom floor model. My mistake. The salesman informed me that all models had parking sensors, fog lights, and Michelin tires and I assumed that he was correct. In fact, he had lied about all three… I got the dealership to agree to swap my tires to Michelins for free (they only come on the top of the line model now). The fog lights and parking sensors were something I should have checked, so I decided to pay for the upgrades myself. Buyer beware. The fog lights went in without issue, but the parking sensors were a joke. When you upgrade, you can only get rear sensors, not front, and they are not the same sensors that are used on the top model. My installed sensors were not flush with the bumper and they did not work. I had to back almost completely into a brick wall to make them start beeping. So a 50% success rate for dealer installed options. Not impressed. Why Acura would dream of building a $50,000 CUV, make it longer, and not include parking sensors as standard is beyond me!

The changes from the 2008 to the 2015, or rather the 2nd generation MDX to the 3rd, were largely not improvements. The power to weight ratio is better on the new car, but acceleration feels anemic in comparison. The suspension is absolutely awful. I had the electromagnetic dampers on my 2008 and it was impressive in the corners! The new model feels far less confident when pushed and my front dampers have developed a constant squeak that causes pedestrians to watch my car as I drive past. The stereo in the old MDX was one of my favorite features and somehow they managed to ruin that on the new model as well. The bass response is weak at best. The touch screen controls are simply awful and make things like adjusting the fan speed for the climate control dangerous while driving. The safety features, like lane departure warning was such a nuisance that I had to disable it. The forward collision warning is dangerous. Mine would go off randomly when I wasn’t near another car! The last thing I want is for my car to slam on the brakes and cause an accident that otherwise would not happen. I spoke with the dealership about the function and was informed that sometimes metal manhole covers or expansion joints will cause the system to produce a false positive. Another safety feature that I had to disable. The materials used inside look and feel cheap. I have a black interior and much of the plastic actually appears to be dark brown. I have had people ask me about it as soon as they get into the car for the first time, so it is noticeable. Finally, the redesign has lowered the height of the vehicle, so while there is a slight increase in cargo space, I’m finding it to be less useable. Oh, I just received my first recall notice…
Acura North America has been useless.

To be fair, there are a few minor improvements. The cabin is generally much quieter, the LED headlights are great, and the gas mileage is better. I was previously getting 14-16 mpg city / 20-22 mpg highway and I am now seeing 19-21 city and 26-28 highway.

If I could go back and undo this deal, I would! My 2008 MDX was superior in almost every way. Build quality has seriously gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's just with the introduction of the 3rd gen MDX or if it's also the assembly line moving from Canada to Alabama. If you are seriously considering a new MDX, I suggest that you take your money elsewhere. I wish I had.

acura,mdx,2015,mdx514, 01/02/2015,Poor visibility in rear,pos,"Overall, I have been very pleased with my 2015 MDX AWD with tech package.  After driving the car for a couple of months, I have become familiar with programming the nav and radio.  My biggest concern with the model is the rear visibility.  When crossing a four lane highway, stopping in the median to continue a left-hand turn, visibility is completely blocked by the rear window brace.  I have experienced this a few times when the car is sitting at an angle and look to the right, you cannot see anything--very scary and dangerous.
"
acura,mdx,2015,robfrommass, 02/27/2015,Forever an Acura Guy,pos,"Traded in my 04 Acura MDX for a 2014 Chevy Traverse, worst move ever. Bought a 2015 MDX Tech and love it. Much easier to see out of, handles like a car, plenty of power and shifts smoothly with the six speed auto. Dual screen can be a little overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of the redundant controls it is actually quite easy to operate with little distraction. LED headlights are second to none. No need to even remove the remote from your pocket, everything is operated through proximity sensors. Third row one touch entry is as easy as it gets. Interior build quality is high but there are a few little flaws. I'm 73"" and wish the drivers seat went back one or two more inches.
Update: Vehicle is now at 47,000 miles.  Needed power tilt steering wheel assenbly replaced under warranty as the electric motors had become very loud. No other repairs needed beyond routine maintenance as of today. There are a few rattles coming from windows when partially open and from the door trim that I wouldn't expect from a luxury brand like Acura, just cheapens the feel of the vehicle. Overall, vehicle has been very reliable and I am still happy with the purchase.

acura,mdx,2015,Christopher, 08/27/2015,7 months into MDX AWD w/ tech - Using everything,pos,"My first MDX.  Owned a TL and a TSX so familiar with the Acura style.   Overall - great SUV.  The most striking thing you will notice 1st is the ride.  Here in N. Texas, very bumpy riding on hard concrete roads that heat crack and leave you wishing for quite & smooth blacktop. The MDX performs extremely well taking a lot of the smashing right out of the ride.   The leather on the seats is the softest I've ever encountered.  Handling is great with the AWD.  Engine power is throaty and responsive.   For improvements, the NAV is crazy.  Found the best way is to just type in the address (good display for such).  Trying to use the voice recognition for NAV is just stupid.  You say,  ""Dallas, TX"" and it says ""Ft. Lauderdale, FL.""  Whatever.  Also stupid is that the NAV system locks (most features) while driving.  Come on!  Hey Acura, there is a passenger who can NAV while driving!    Any new car with a lot of features will eventually make you reach to understand the system instead of being intuitive.  The NAV takes time.  Once you have the address in, the NAV works great. Storage is good so long as the 3rd seats are not used.  Using the seats leaves you with a small space left.  Also, these 3rd-row seats are kid seats as grown ups will have a difficult time getting to them and being comfortable.  I've had luck with the quality- no issues.  Got a recall notice for the bolt on the compressor for AC.  Easy fix they say.  Dealership experience is great.  Give you a free Acura loaner if your request.   This is my wife's car and she loves it for herself and our daughter.   In fact, my daughter always wants to take the MDX over my car.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Gordon F, 02/11/2017,"Looking for Luxury, just can't find it in the MDX.",neg,"We chose the Acura MDX based largely on positive online reviews from car journals and magazines.  I suppose we should've read actual owner reviews.  The model appealed to us largely due to its advertised ""luxury"", and its size (with third-row seating) was a good match for our family of five.  At $50,400, our SH-AWD model with Tech Package was certainly priced in the premium segment over the Honda Pilot on which it's based on.  Unfortunately, as time went on, we grew to like the vehicle less and less.  Amongst our major complains are the lack of luxury.  This car simply does not feel luxurious.  The windows (all four of them), when lowered even slightly, rattle uncontrollably.  There is literally a half-inch of play.  Acura dealer says this is normal.  We don't think it is.  The rattle is not only VERY audible and annoying, but it doesn't befit a $50k luxury SUV.  Second, the overall interior feels cheap.  Many parts are not aligned correctly, the materials feel like they were made by the lowest bidder.  For example, our steering column cover has a huge gap in it.  The pieces were clearly not correctly attached at the factory.  When I brought this up with the dealer, he blamed me for breaking them and quoted me a price to replace it.  Which brings me to my other major disappointment.  Service.  They do not treat their customers like valued luxury-brand car owners.  They're more interested in constantly selling their high-margin services (ATF Fluid change, cabin filter, etc.), rather than addressing known issues.  Our local Acura dealer is consistently cold-calling us, trying to sell us ""specials"".  All this, despite the fact that Acura corporate tells me I do not need any service that is not displayed on the dash board.  We're not due for an ATF Fluid change until 20k-40k miles.  Our dealer said it was dirty and had to be changed at just 8k miles!   The power liftgate has been to service three times now.  Each time they claim to fix it, it breaks a day later.  I don't even bother taking it in anymore.  But reliability isn't a major issue for us.  The car has been relatively low-maintenance.  It's the little things that ultimately add-up to a less-than expected experience.  The infotainment system for example.  I'd expect it to be a little better.  We own a 2015 VW GTI (for which we paid roughly half the price - $25k), yet the infotainment has a beautiful, fluid interface.  It's fast, responsive, and does what you need it to do.  The infotainment on our Acura MDX has an interface as if it were designed by a first-year graphic design student.  They really aimed for the bare minimum.  It's also slow and unresponsive.  Changing functions or settings often results in a 2-3 second lag.  Why not use an updated processor?  The premium ELS Audio (as Acura calls it), is also, sadly, a joke.  It simply sounds horrible.  I don't have many cars to compare it to other than our 2015 VW GTI, whose premium ""Fender"" audio system is simply generations ahead of the one in our MDX.   We're frankly just not that impressed at this, supposedly ""luxurious"" vehicle.  It feels anything but, with a lot of the interior pieces feeling loose, being misaligned, and a the rattling windows and doors feel like they'll fall apart.  I was quite optimistic about the vehicle when we first leased it, but over the past two years I've grown to really dislike it.  We can't wait for our lease to be up next year.

acura,mdx,2015,jesseg2, 06/14/2015,GPS and Bluetooth are unsable- get a base model,pos,"I have had my tech package MDX for over 6 months now and can confidently say that a $100 tomtom GPS beats the in-dash hands down. 
Boot time takes about 60 seconds. Sluggish input. Passenger cannot input an address while moving. score 0 of 10.

The Bluetooth phone is horrible. People ask if I have the windows down or if they are on speaker phone. My $100 Plantronics voyager works perfectly. Also can't press any digits on touchscreen when vehicle is moving. But can use the iPhone to press # for conference calls, etc. 0/10

Save your money and get the base MDX.

acura,mdx,2015,Bizle, 04/21/2018,Beware of rear suspension clunk/thumping,pos,"Bought a 2015 MDX w/ 33,000 miles on it last weekend.   Noticed a clunking sound from rear suspension right away, mainly only at slow speeds on rough pavement, however very noticeable.  I just dropped it back off at dealer last night.  I was just told they need to replace the rear dampers as they are faulty.   I have had a really good experience with dealer and am confident they will take care of it.  Just want to raise awareness for any potential buyers of used 2014-2016 MDX.  I was unaware when I bought the vehicle-acura is aware of the problem and issued a service bulletin 16-035 in a July 2016.

acura,mdx,2015,Carrie Shaheen, 04/02/2015,beware the 19 in wheels,pos,"very happy with my new MDX with 2 exceptions, one serious, the other just annoying.  the serious issue, the  19 in wheels are a huge problem if you need to replace a tire anywhere but a large city.  NO ONE carries the 19 in tires.  i had a flat in Lake City, Fl.  My choices Macon or Tpa.   200 miles in either direction.  2 closer Acura dealers did not carry the tire.  200 mi on a donut is too much.  worse yet the  dealer says a full size spare won't fit.  Until these tires become more available I'd stay away from them.  The annoying issue:  the voice controls for navigation, radio etc are just flat hilarious.  Call home pretty routinely either adjusts my AC or finds the closest drug store.  "
acura,mdx,2015,tspring1, 12/31/2014,Very Pleased with my Choice!,pos,"After being an American car guy for years, I bought my first Honda ten years ago and have since owned three.  Honda's are rock solid and other that gas and routine maintenance, I've never had any other problems.

I am at a point in my life where I am looking to move to the next level and considered Lexus and Infinity, but given my history with Honda I looked at the Acura's.  I bought a black on black MDX with all the bells and whistles and while I have only had my new MDX for a few days, I am in love.  For being an SUV it drives more like a sedan and it's very agile.  The interior is top notch and the car rides extremely quiet.  It's still very early but I am very pleased with the quality."
acura,mdx,2015,SteveLo33, 07/19/2016,2015 MDX Tech Package- AWESOME!,pos,"My wife and I have owned several SUV's both large and small and when looking to replace a GMC Acadia we were having a tough time finding a small SUV with a 3rd row seat that had all the features and benefits of the Acadia.  After looking at many different manufacturers and not wanting to go back to a GM product due to repair and breakdown issues we settled on the Audi and the Acura.  Looking at and test driving both vehicles we both felt the Acura was more comfortable, offered better visibility and had a nicer interior.  We went with it and the MDX has been fantastic.  Definitely a 5 Star ***** vehicle.  Performance, handling and overall satisfaction could not be higher.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Florida buyer, 09/11/2018,Disappointed with ride,neu,"Test drove many MDX that seemed great. Bought a different one that seemed a little bumpy on test drive but not super noticeable. 6 months later and after having dealer change shocks and factory recall dampers in rear it still handles road bumps terrible. Hear thud and clunking and makes you cringe with every bump. Its like it has no shocks when it hits bumps and potholes. Transmission hunts at certain speeds and RPM becomes jerky. Highway ride on smooth pavement is very good. Changes the driver seat position from 1 to 2 at random. Good interior space, seating, and interior arrangement. Overall its not the dream MDX we thought it was. Other years ride better from what we understand. But this 2015 is very bad and we have to get rid of it now so we dont have to deal with the bumps for 6 years.
"
acura,mdx,2015,johnnymac_ak, 03/04/2015,Very good vehicle ***UPDATED***UPDATED AGAIN***,pos,"Owned the car for about two months now. Purchased in Oregon and drove the AlCan highway up to Alaska in Feb. to where I live.  This vehicle handled every bit of snow & ice thrown at it. I drove 2400+ miles, for 3+ days on glaze slick roads & never felt a slip. Very comfortable & lots of room.  It drives much smaller than it is.  The LED lights are very crisp & reach pretty far.  The infotainment system is definitely something you have to get used to.  It does so many things & is extremely complex so initially it was a little overwhelming, but after a few hours of seat time, things are getting easier now.  I drove the RX450 Hybrid, Audi Q5 & Q7, VW Touareg & Pathfinder & the MDX won us. I recommend it.  

*** UPDATE***
Been about three years now and I'm still pretty excited about driving the MDX every time I walk towards it with the key in my pocket....  It's our vehicle of choice when it's icy or snowy outside as it handles most everything Alaska has thrown at it with ease.  The SH-AWD is amazing.  I'm still not very good at using some of the tech that's installed.  The voice command systems is a bit sketchy.  It misinterprets my commands quite often, although I've used others and have had similar results with others, so I think the technology industry wide is still getting up to speed.  There are a couple of bugs I've noticed in the electronic system, like heated seats won't work after I've auto-started it twice, but nothing that would change my mind about owning it.  We can load quite a bit of cargo in it so long trips and stops at Home Depot work well, and if I keep my foot out of the ""go fast"" pedal, we get in the lower 20mpg's combined.  All in all, I am still very happy with our choice and knowing what I know now, I'd do it exactly the same again.

***UPDATED AGAIN***
Four years in now and still very happy with the car.  Haven't had any maintenance or failures out of the norm.  I'm a little surprised at the drop in resale value however.  I would have figured that being an Acura, it would have held it's value better.  According to Edmunds and other valuation sites, this vehicle has lost about 45% of its original value.  We have purchased a new Ram 1500 (Laramie - completely optioned out) in the last 6 months and although the excitement of driving a new vehicle is there, and the Ram has many creature comforts, the MDX is still our favorite vehicle for longer trips as it handles better, is more comfortable and is just all around a much safer vehicle.  As stated before (and even with my new truck) the voice recognition software that is designed to make things safer is entirely frustrating and it is simply easier (at least for me) to pull over and do it all by hand like I used to.
*** 5th Year UPDATE***
Still happy overall.  Still hate the voice recognition software.  Still not happy about the resale value.  Still have less than 30k miles on it but it seems that the MPG's are getting better.  Still our go-to car for trips.  I recommend it totally if you're looking for a few year old car that is a great machine.

So far not a single negative thought about the vehicle. Performance has been exactly as promised."
acura,mdx,2015,jeff, 07/26/2016,Acura flagship model dropped the flag,neg,"My 3rd Acura in the last 25 years. 1st was a 94 Legend - was a great car. Next was a TL - not so great. This MDX will be my last. Owned for 16 months and driven 13000 miles. Excessive road noise. Driving on rough roads difficult to carry on conversation with person in the middle seat. My 2 year old grandson can draw a better picture than the back up camera gives. It is totally worthless. Navigation is extremely poor - use your phone. Complained about issues at each service appointment but all I get is that will tightened this or that and see how it is until next time. Other words, kicking the can down the road till warranty is out. I did go visit local BMW dealer this past week - anyone want to buy a slightly used MDX?

12-1-16  Update - Traded the MDX for a X5 demo car. Took a $10K loss in the MDX but it was still the best move I could make. I am done with Acura.
"
acura,mdx,2015,JDC NJ, 06/28/2016,No longer a premium vehicle or ownership experienc,neg,"This is one of the worst vehicles we've ever owned and has been rife with significant quality issues almost since we picked it up. For reference, these include:      Body panels were missing attachment clips when car was delivered, quarter panel and bumper came loose. Multiple electrical issues including a bad alternator that dealer took 3 visits to diagnose. Satellite radio failed. Braking became uneven in the first year, dealer refused to address (in tolerance), now needs a brake job after <30k, abnormal tire wear, white paint comes off of car with the most minor contact (paint is thinner to save weight, per dealer), transmission shifts oddly with a great deal of engine noise (within tolerance). Aside from the quality issues, the electronics are poorly executed and difficult to use. You need to read the manual to learn how to change a radio station...and don't dare try to change audio or climate control while you are driving, its is so complicated as to be genuinely dangerous. I just had a great call with Acura customer service where I was told that I should bring the car back to the dealer and discuss all of these issues, again, with no support from Acura. This was once a great brand that produced great products, the MDX should really be out of the premium SUV category and reviewed against Hyundai, GM, Ford, and Toyota, it is premium to those products only in terms of price.

acura,mdx,2015,aparichithan, 12/18/2014,2015 MDX with Tech,neu,"I recently purchased a brand new MDX-Tech. Its a good car in many respect for a middle class family like me who can at most shell some 45k towards a 7 seater. But ACURA being a so called luxury brand, I would expect them to use some reasonably good plastic inside. My car seat hinge cover broke apart in one pull... that did not speak about the quality."
acura,mdx,2015,avv, 06/03/2015,Thermometer/AC problem,pos,"I haven't seen anybody else mention this, but it's probably my only problem with the car since I bought it last December. If I drive the car awhile, and then park it for an hour or so, the next time I take it out, the car thermometer will read about 10C to 14C degrees higher than what it should be. As a result, the AC will then blow full blast for about 5-10 minutes until the thermometer gradually adjusts itself to the correct temperature as I drive around. For instance, it could be about 17C degrees out, but when I take the car out later, the temperature might read about 29C degrees for a little while. If it stay less than 1h there is no problem at all."
acura,mdx,2015,bhuddle, 01/13/2015,My last Acura,neu,"I have owned several Acura products over the years.  I traded a 2011 MDX for this new model.  I can't believe how much they have cheapened up the new model.  The seats are very uncomfortable, covered with low grade leather.  The HD screen of the previous model has been replaced with two sub par displays.  The infotainment offering is horrible, unintuitive, hard to navigate.  It doesn't even have tailpipes, replaced with faux lookalikes.  I have to take the key fob out of my pocket and hold it up to the handle to unlock.  Overall, a very unsatisfactory vehicle."
acura,mdx,2015,emwhydee, 06/20/2015,I want to love this SUV but too many negatives,neu,"I live in AZ and have had this vehicle for 14 months and whenever the temps rise above 90 degrees and the car is parked in the sun the LKAS and LDW do not work.  I get a message that the camera is too hot.  10-15 minutes later, the cameras start working but by that time I am already home.  I purchased this car because of these safety features but did not realize they would not work.  What a waste.  The voice activated navigation system is equally poor and does not recognize addresses or place names so it is another lost cause.  I do not recommend buying this car for these features.
On the plus side, the SUV is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned.  The seat hugs you, the ride is quiet and it is easy to drive.  This is why I want to love this SUV but the negatives outweigh these positives.  I purchased a high end vehicle specifically for these safety features and when they don't work, I end up hating the car all over again.  I will not buy or lease an Acura again.

acura,mdx,2015,mrso718, 07/25/2014,Almost got everything right,pos,"My first car was the 2013 RDX so when a 2014 MDX redesign was coming out, I knew I had to get one. Because of the over design and value of this vehicle, two years down the road we (my wife and I) traded in our RDX, which was great, for the 2015 MDX. Fell in love with the vehicle immediately, BUT not a minute longer of driving off the lot, we started to discover little things that the quality of this vehicle is REALLY lacking. Loud adjustable seat motors, scraping noise coming from the steering wheel louder, louder then normal engine, a paint job gone bad, bad outside temperature gauge and the list goes on! Acura what have you done?"
acura,mdx,2015,Phoathnou Mao, 01/27/2017,Accelerate,neu,"Make sure test drive and pay attention to the acceleration. The speed dropped quickly causing the driver and passengers whiplash unexpected.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Tanner, 08/01/2015,It's on the inside what matter,neu,"The 2015 Acura MDX is not a ""flashy"" car to the normal eye but certainly does hold its own against other luxury SUV. Handling is very light but easy to get used to. The interior is where the MDX shines, materials are very nice inside and easily accessible however having the tech package you certainly must be good with today's technology because at certain points it can feel overwhelming. Road quality if very nice as well, having owned the Audi Q7 it is very comparable. However only having 15,000 miles I cannot touch base on reliability quite yet."
acura,mdx,2015,Patty S, 11/21/2016,Not so great,neu,"OK, was expecting much more for 50 grand. Biggest disappointment is nav-still use my phone, yet paid big bucks for what I thought would be luxurious, it is cumbersome & unuseful- never never use, sad technology. Radio reception can be shaky, connection light goes in & out(including volumn)-I live in metro area & should be clear as a bell. I am frustrated because what I read was so stellar on the MDX, car of the year. I realize I am fussy but I thought I was paying for that. Not so. Also don't like I can not have digital speedometer, only old school dash-not sure what happened here but I am wanted high end luxury, you can't even tell what kind of car it is from the side. I literally was confused when I first bought this car- is it too much to ask to put ACURA or MDX on the side of a car--CARS LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE FROM THE SIDE- WHITE SUV---MAKE IT SPECIAL--DUUH. Do not feel special in the least driving this car, what has happened to that's a cool looking car. Bottom line I would not have spent the extra money on an acura, it's not that great. Unfortunately, this is my dream car for a long time. What I like is the engine it does have power, but- the keyless entry is defective too- at times I have to find the fob to lock or unlock-perfection has not been found in the 2015 MDX in my opinion, what's better? that verdict is out
"
acura,mdx,2015,Jerry, 01/20/2016,Strange and dangerous downshift.,neu,"Be careful with the strange sudden acceleration when braking. Shifts into lower gear and lurches forward when applying break. Dealer recognizes this and tells me Acura needs to hear more complaints before addressing the problem. I'm worried a lot this during slippery roads.
"
acura,mdx,2015,richpar, 01/24/2015,The best SUV money can buy,pos,"I've owned several Acura's and this is the best yet. The power and how the vehicle handles is amazing. Extremely quiet, spacious with amazing technology. Test drove every luxury brand and my decision remained the same. The seats are like heaven and I just love the stereo. Took her on a trip across country and wanted to just keep on driving. Really a fun to drive SUV. Added fog lights and trailer hitch and can tow the required 5K pounds (more than what I need). "
acura,mdx,2015,Aroon Patel, 08/06/2016,Mostly satisfied.,pos,"The seating is not as comfortable as my Acura  2006. Long distances  I get tired. Cargo space  small. Gas mileage  great. Also the steering wheel cannot  be  adjusted  that much.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Fran Mirabelle, 09/23/2017,"Better Than My 2011 MDX, But Not Perfect",pos,"Regarding gas mileage, my 2015 MDX does much better than my 2011 MDX did.  For that I am grateful.  Both vehicles recommended using 91 octane or higher.  I faithfully do.  However, and unfortunately, I used to have weather information available in my 2011 with the tech package, which no longer is available without now paying for it.  Honestly, the vehicle costs enough already without add-on expenses.  Also, occasionally and without reason, the brake warning flashes.  I've asked about it at the dealership, but no one there seems to know anything about it or has heard of other owners citing it.  Apparently, no recalls are associated with this . . . yet.  Recently, my battery failed.  it was only 2.5 years old.  Generally, they should last 5 years, or so I'm told.  At any rate it was a Japanese battery that had a bulge in one side when it was replaced.  Not sure what that means, but it would not have been good for the engine compartment had it exploded.  Finally, the GPS is poor.  Honestly, a smart phone with a GPS app is far better.  I will likely buy another MDX in a couple of years, but will look to see if these deficiencies have been corrected.  The MDX is still likely one of the best in its class.  Added comment (9/2019): Recently, I have experienced a problem with the locking/unlocking mechanism.  It seems to happen after the vehicle is washed.  I took it to the dealership, but they could not replicate the problem, so it remains a mystery.  Overall, the MDX is a good vehicle, as it is approaching 100,000 miles, but will now look at other SUVs when it is time to replace it since the new MDXs have smaller cargo areas and an annoying engine cutoff when idling.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Karl, 04/18/2018,Not your Japan Acura,neu,"Now that the MDX is built in Alabama, the fit and finish is no better than my old Ram pickup.  The transmission is jerky and the brake assist likes to come on whenever it feels like it.  Nav, phone, and infotainment setup and use is totally overdone and complicated.  I can't really blame the problems on Alabama, but this is not the MDX you're used to.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Steve D, 07/28/2018,Not what I would expect from a $47k car,neg,"Suspension sucks! Clunky every time you hit a bump. Transmission is pretty weak. Shifts too many times.
"
acura,mdx,2015,GRJ, 03/01/2020,Nice and Fast,pos,"We purchased a 2015 Tech FWD model in the Fall of 2014 and despite negative reviews I've since read, have had no problems at all.  I take it in religiously every 5000 miles for the oil change / tire rotation and whatever else is required all at the dealer.  I have a lifetime alignment package from Firestone so a couple of times a year I take it over to be sure all is well as far as alignment is concerned.  There have been a couple of recalls handled by Acura but our MDX so far has been unaffected by the notifications.  I like it because it's quick, comfortable, especially for passengers in the second row (never used the third row) and has decent cargo space.  The negatives would be the actual amount of space for cargo (would like more) and the Acura/Honda info system is weird and not easy to use at all.  This is our second MDX the first being a 2011 and what sold me is that you can use regular fuel in this model (although they suggest premium) and the mileage is great 23/28.  Five years and no engine performance issues at all on regular.  Since it was expensive to purchase, I plan to drive this one for a few more years.
"
acura,mdx,2015,Lee Nalley, 08/09/2015,My first step up.,neg,"I have had my MDX for 10 months now and have several problems that cannot be explained:  The indicators for blind side vehicles will go off when no one is by them; the gas cap light will go off when nothing is wrong; the front breaking light will go off when there is nothing in front of me; and the windshield wipers will go off when it is nice and bright and sunny.  I'm told at the service area that they can't find anything wrong and cannot pinpoint the problem, but will keep checking the their update sheets and if anything comes across, they will let me know.  This is a safety issue as far as I'm concerned as the breaking light comes on, my reaction is put the breaks on.
Also, have a problem with the windows being down at high speeds, the tailgate wants to try to pop open, you can see gaps appear along the sides.  Again the service agent cannot find anything wrong.
I have the heated seats and it feels as if they were never turned off, making it a little uncomfortable during the summer months.
The interior is comfortable, but with a lot of road noise; handling is good and acceleration is really good.
I am sorry that I spent what I did for this car.

I have since traded my 2015 Acura for a 2016 GMC Acadia and am much happier with the overall performance and handling.

acura,mdx,2015,drjaykorsen, 11/17/2014,Buyers remorse,neu,"I had my MDX for just a few weeks and the warning lights started going off for tire pressure, check engine, and a few other things.  Brought it in and it had a computer reset.  That seemed to help but come on!  The computer, nav and radio voice commands are not very intuitive.  You have to memorize a text book to make it functional...no thanks!  I just got a ""recall"" notice in the mail I have been waiting for and it is just for the radio, nav and phone, not to address the other computer problem.  Lastly, I get flashed every time I drive at night because the headlights Blind Every Oncoming Car...What a 50K dollar pain in the Butt!"

At low speeds especially when turning into my driveway there is a knocking noise that sounds like a 20 year old car losing a ball joint.  When i start the car there is a rumbling noise that comes and goes. And the newest problem is a very rough downshift when slowing down to a point that you get thrown into the steering wheel. This is my first Acura i have had 6 new hondas and i am saying BYE BYE to honda and Acura forever. Their cars got cheeper and cheeper every year and i dont mean in price but quality.

Not to mention the last replacement was only one month ago, and it is already chipped AGAIN!! Not sure if this is due to the angle of the windshield or thickness of the glass. But we cringe every time we are driving and road debris or rocks hit the vehicle. And mind you, this is just typical road conditions. There appears to be other complaints online with this same issue.

I love driving this smooth piece Advanced machinery and believe its safety features will keep my family safe. There is no better purchase at this price range or higher and with as little maintenance as this is going to take, it's a keeper..."

The next morning, many error messages came on after starting the car - tire pressure warning, emissions system warning, transmission system warning. I was unable to drive the car. The car was towed to the dealership, we were assured it was a battery problem. We were given a new battery and left for a trip. We then drove it several hours, parked it overnight, and received the same messages the next day when we tried to start the car.
Another tow, another dealership in a new state.
Two weeks later, and we don't have the car back yet. Acura Client Services has been really unhelpful. I would not recommend this car to anyone. "

Suddenly, all my systems were not functioning and the computer was warning about no all wheel drive, no power steering, no LDW, etc. So, I used roadside assistance and scheduled an 830am appointment on Saturday morning to pick up my car and have it towed to the Brooklyn Acura dealer. At 9am, I was told they would tow the car at 940am. At 10am, I was told 11am. Finally, I had a tow at 11am. "

When the time arrives to buy another vehicle, I will look at another MDX, but will check to see if these deficiencies have been corrected.  Despite these nit picks, the MDX is still likely one of the best in its class, and it is very stylish.  That styling has been copied by other manufacturers.

I read another customer's review which stated he was having issues with the ""adaptable transmission"".  The transmission in my MDX is also rough with gear changes. I took the car in to the dealership numerous times to ""fix"" the problem before one of the service workers told me that it was just the way the car drives!
I am also having problems with the driver door not unlocking.  Most of the time I am able to get in the car but intermittently I cannot get in the driver door but I am able to open all of the passenger doors.  Has anyone had issues with lock outs?  Even though my car is still under warranty the dealership will not fix it because they cannot get it to duplicate the issue.  I even sent the dealership service manager a video of one of the lockouts clearly showing the key fob in my hand and not being able to open the driver side door but able to open the passenger door. Acura will still not fix the issue.
Also, the inside of all of the doors and lift gate have dark discoloration that cannot be cleaned off.  I've never had this happen to any cars that I have owned.  Anyone have issues with discoloration inside the doors?

Id owned an old TL that I loved and was hoping to have the same romance with an MDX. I took it to a third party mechanic the day after I bought it and he said it looked clean. A week after that inspection, while driving at low speed on my suburban neighborhood street the front suspension started to make rather loud thunks and creaks as if something was loose or a tire was about to break off. At higher speeds the problem disappeared. A week later on the way to Costco two blocks from our house my wife turned to me and said, “you need to take this car to the dealership and get it looked at.” I did. I took it and sold it and bought a Lexus RX350."

I called Acura customer service and even they just dragged it till my car was out of warranty and after that, they just hung up on me and nothing else they can do. I have all the dealership record to show I have taken the car to the dealer multiple times or same issue. Because of absolutely pathetic customer service I will never go near Acura or Honda product. Just wish they can improve their customer service and dealers. I purchased mine from Clinton Acura in NJ and they were the ones who failed to fix the problem.

This is my second MDX (my wife's car) and while I am big fan of the vehicle, Acura made some horrible tweaks to the car.  If I were to buy this car again, I would try to find a 2015 model.

Pros:  The interior is beautiful with great materials.  The ride quality is excellent and always gives confidence.

Cons: The are 3 man issues with this car
1) The transmission is truly horrible.  I am car guy who has owned many cars and have never experienced such a bad transmission.  PLEASE release a software update to fix this
2) The auto-idle is poorly executed and there is no way to permanently turn it off.
3) Infotainment system is dated and the GPS in mediocre"
acura,mdx,2016,Very Disappointed, 11/28/2015,2016 MDX Vibration Part II,neg,"Very disappointed, follow up to my previous post, ok my car has been at the dealers 6 times now for a vibration between 55 to 75 MPH 4,900 miles they keep saying they have to confirm the vibration which I have a service order from October stating they confirmed the vibration, they replaced the brake rotors, needless to say vibration still there, they replaced the tires, vibration still there, took it back to the dealer today for 6th time, another test drive with the service manager he said he could feel something but wasn't sure what it was, back seat was vibrating extensively, service manager acknowledged it, said he would take a new MDX off the lot drive it same route we drove mine to see if the road made it vibrate. They called and said they test drove a new MDX off the lot and it vibrates worse than mine so it's a characteristic of the vehicle. They actually put this in writing on the service order. I asked if they were informing consumers of this vibration characteristic when they were looking at the vehicles and they said no, I told them just because the other car vibrates does not make it right, it sounds like a design defect to me, this  directive came from the District Service Manager I cannot believe they would actually think that is acceptable, they all vibrate so that makes it acceptable???? Buyer beware I would not buy the 2016 Acura MDX."
acura,mdx,2016,G. Adams, 07/28/2015,"Great, responsive car. Terrible interface.",pos,"Before buying, I test drove a 2016 Pilot EX-L and a 2015 MDX. In my opinion, the MDX felt more agile and responsive than the Pilot, and I preferred the MDX's interior and exterior styling over the Pilot. 

The Good:
Car handles incredibly well. Accelerates, turns, and brakes superbly. If you're looking for a three-row SUV, I can't think of anything that would come even close to the same level of performance and value, except perhaps a Pilot. The only other option I considered was the Volvo XC90, but it would cost around 25-30% more, and although I greatly prefer the Volvo's interior and user interface, my friends with Volvos have had issues with reliability. Audi Q7 also looks great, but again price and reliability issues steered me away. So, from a price-performance-reliability standard, the MDX is very hard to beat. I took the MDX on a curvy, secluded mountain highway, and it was truly the most thrilling drive I've ever had. I'm happy with the car.

The Bad:
The user interface is disgraceful. Acura's worst yet, and that's saying something. Even though the dealer set up the car for my wife and me, my wife's first solo drive in the car had  her near tears because of the maddening user interface. For instance, getting the car to accept her phone's bluetooth connection instead of mine was crazy complex, and you have to go through two entirely separate menus if you want to transfer both the phone operations and the phone's media (e.g., Pandora) from one source to another.  Even everyday tasks like turning on the seat's heaters, adjusting the A/C, or tinkering with the audio settings (e.g., fade/balance) all take multiple levels of menus, requiring too much of the driver's focus and attention. I sorely miss when I could do any of those things with a single gesture (flip a switch! turn a dial!) without having to take my eyes off the road. Now, I have to find the 1 cm square on the display panel that takes me to the menu to adjust the fan. Then the menu changes, and I have to navigate my hand to the ""+"" and ""-"" icons. Even when I know what to do -- which isn't often the case, because the menu system is poorly laid out -- my eyes leave the road for what'd I guess to be about three seconds... just to adjust the fan! 

Speaking of user interfaces, the displays in the car are terrible. Just plain old washed out and ""fuzzy."" I'm wondering if Acura got a deal on surplus parts from circa 2001. Backup camera quality feels like it's made from Soviet-era parts, and the touchpad was probably made from leftover Microsoft Zune panels. Resolution and clarity are shameful. 

Other annoyances:
The glove compartment light apparently only comes on if the headlights are on. I, personally, tend to open the glove compartment when the engine is off, and even if it's light outside, the back of my glove compartment is still pretty dark.

The chrome trim used all over the center stack reflects the sun like a mirror, creating an annoying and blinding distraction. My wife and I each experienced this independently, so I don't think I'm being nit-picky. Look for a recall on this in future months, where your dealer installs non-reflective stickers over the chrome trim to solve this safety issue. ;-)   

With Acura's button-based transmission system, it seems impossible to park the car, turn off the engine, and keep the radio on. There's a ridiculous ""car wash"" mode that lets you turn off the car and keep it in neutral, but good luck remembering the proper sequence of brake, button, and transmission to put it in this mode, and I'm still not sure how practical this mode is anyway. 

Suspension is... bumpy if not jarring. 

Too much hard plastic.

Acura dealer mentioned crazy expensive parts when trying to upsell on warranty. Do headlights really cost $1,100!?

Notes on AcuraWatch Plus:
AcuraWatch plus is a suite of features like adaptive cruise control and lane keep
 assist. Unfortunately, it does not include blind spot monitoring. I had great hopes for both adaptive cruise and lane keep assist, but neither seem quite ready for prime time. Adaptive cruise is a little too slow to react, especially when speeding back up either when the car in front accelerates or when you change lanes to go around a slower car. Lane keep assist is at times too aggressive while at other times too oblivious of the car's drifting across lanes.  It also seems to continually ""test"" if the driver is actively steering by subtly turning the wheel slightly back and forth. After a couple of hours of driving, my arms and shoulders were sore from subconsciously fighting these small, constant tugs on the steering wheel. On the other hand, I have had at least one successful driving experience where I let the car do most of the steering while I barely assisted. That was kind of fun, but I don't foresee those opportunities arising often, due to typical traffic and road conditions.

Overall: Great car, terrible tech.

acura,mdx,2016,Glen Tryer, 07/13/2015,Wife's 2016 Acura MDX with SH-AWD Advance,pos,"We looked at numerous SUVs and Sedans but kept coming back to the Acura MDX.  Build quality, fit & finish, ride comfort, interior materials, driving performance and styling were equaled only by several of the other Japanese auto makers.  Acura was the only one with a dealership nearby so it wouldn't be a hardship if the MDX does have problems in the future.  This is our fourth Acura so we do have some degree of owner loyalty.  Both of these factors weighed heavily in our decision on which SUV to purchase.

However, there are several things that we do not care for and they are as follows,  the automatic stop/start feature is a nuisance (and it cannot be disabled), navigation system and driver / vehicle interface is cumbersome  and complex.  You're better off just learning to use the voice prompt for most commands.  I prefer the Bluetooth connectivity in my 2011 Ford truck than the Acura phone system.  My wife has learned to use Siri on her linked IPhone to make calls from the MDX's Bluetooth connection (it's easier than their system, at least in her opinion).

We drove both the two wheel drive and SH-AWD versions and I can say for a fact that the AWD option handles and performs MUCH better in a hard rain.  We typically don't have any snow or Ice in this part of Texas but my guess is that the AWD would do just as well in those driving conditions too.  Another consideration is that when the SH-AWD option ($2000) is purchased, you also get a spare tire and jack.  If you buy these items separately from the dealer they are $510.  The two wheel MDX drive DOES NOT COME with a spare tire. The multiple versions of ride control (e.g. IDS, Comfort, Normal, Sport) are wasted on us.  Why would anyone want to drive a glorified station wagon in Sport Mode, the MDX is not a sports car!  Acura could get away from having to install the VERY expensive magnetic shock absorbers currently in use but I suppose if that's what the competition is doing they have to do it too.

Transmission, shift points, smoothness, etc. all seem to be set OK for normal to moderately aggressive driving.  We really like the transmission push buttons in lieu of a ""gear shift lever"" sticking up in the middle of the console.  The MDX has paddle shifters, if you have the need to shift manually but I doubt we'll ever use them.

The engine is strong, quiet and idles smoothly.  Our overall fuel economy has been in line with Acura's posted claims for miles per gallon but I sure wish they could have figured out how to do it on Regular (87 octane) fuel.

Wheels and tires on the Advance model are good looking 19"" wheels w/ Michelin rubber, but I saw several of the basic MDX two wheel drive vehicles equipped with Hankook tires.  They would not be my first choice of tires on a $40K vehicle.

Warranty is comparable to Lexus and Infiniti, I cannot understand why the Europeans (especially the Germans cannot seem to keep up with their competition in this category).  As of this writing, we have not purchased an extended warranty on this vehicle and I doubt that we will.  After all, Acura and Honda's claim to fame is their remarkable reliability and dependably so those features should be designed and built into the vehicle. I wish we had more mileage and driving time in the vehicle prior to writing this review but at least I could share a few things with a prospective buyer.  

In summation, my wife REALLY likes the vehicle.  The additional room, the ability to set up a little higher than you do in a typical sedan and ease of driving were big selling points.
I've changed my mind about several items.  The nine (9) speed transmission is sort of annoying , especially when driving through an area where it has to stay in a lower gear.  It's constantly ""Hunting"" for the correct gear.  Ours is the Advance SHAWD version and it has proximity collision monitors front and rear however I think that ALL
 models should either have these as standard equipment or available as an option.  Safety should not be held hostage for an additional $6K option.  Still don't like the engine stop / start feature but it appears that numerous other auto manufacturers are opting to install the same thing in their vehicles.  Guess that's a way they can claim a fraction more gas mileage on their overall EPA rating.  Other than being a nuisance, I wonder what the toll is on the starter, battery, flywheel, etc. as additional wear and tear?
Having said those things, we continue to be very pleased with the vehicle!  Dependable, reliable and comfortable (both city and highway driving).  We would definitely purchase the same make and model again!
1/11/17 - 15,000 miles.  Vehicle is performing very well.  We have pretty much learned how to use all of the technology so that mini-crises has passed. We have not experienced any mechanical, electrical or driving issues with the SUV. Would continue to recommend it to other potential buyers.
1/16/18, 20,250 miles.  We're still happy with the Acura.

acura,mdx,2016,Sid J, 09/11/2015,I love my new 2016 MDX !,pos,"My wife and I were in the market for our first luxury crossover and we couldn't be happier with our purchase (Advance Pkg, SH-AWD). Let me say outright that we did not consider any German cars for reasons ranging from high price point/high maintenance to poor reliability/longevity. We weren't particular about having 3-rows, but felt it'd be nice to have the option (for trips with family/friends) - the MDX fit the bill perfectly. I've had my MDX for 6-weeks and driven 1800 miles, so its obviously too early to talk about reliability(which the Acura brand is known for) but here are the pros/cons as I see it.
Pros:
- Drives great. Plenty of power to summon in any situation (esply with Normal/Sport IDS modes).
- Very comfortable seats & ride. You don't feel minor road imperfections & the suspension does a great job of dampening out big potholes.
- Very quiet cabin. Conversation between 1st & 2nd row passengers have never been easier.
- Gas sipper (I use premium 93 octane). I consistently average over 24-mpg in combined driving. Averaged 26-mpg during a recent 600-mile road trip(80% highway) with 5 adults, fully loaded cargo space (3rd row folded). That said, I always use cruise at highway speeds and avoid very hard acceleration/braking.  I calculate MPG estimates to be 100% sure though the tip computer is not off by much (-0.5 to +1 MPG off actual).
- Realized the beauty of SH-AWD driving on curvy, hilly wet roads (yet to test on snow/heavy rain). Just when I thought I needed to hit the brakes to slow around a corner, the MDX breezes past with aplomb. It drives like a car - you don't feel body roll, side-to-side weight transfer during turns.
- Love all the safety features, esply the Lane departure warning.  I read recently that it received great crash-test scores.
Now for the Cons:
- Depending on the gear you are in, the transmission sometimes seems to lag for a split second before it accelerates. I believe this has to do with dog clutch in the ZF-9 speed design. 
- Adaptive cruise may seem hard on braking/acceleration depending on how you normally drive.
- Touchscreen response is a tad slower than I'd like it to be.
- Fog lights are offered only as an accessory (extra $)
- Power-folding side mirrors, panaromic roof,  motion-activated power liftgate not available.

I've seen people voice concerns on online forums regarding transmission, build quality(as MDXs are built now in Alabama Vs Canada until about a couple of years ago)  but based on my experience, I'm inclined to believe most of them are unjustified. There have also been complaints about higher than usual noise coming from under the hood(for someone outside the car) even when the a/c compressor is not running -  the owners manual clearly says that is expected as a result of the system checks ! Complaints related to dual-screen is a matter of getting used to - I actually find it convenient. The 3rd row of seating is mostly for kids (or short adults for upto 2-hr ride). In my opinion, this is the most well-rounded luxury crossover offering an optimal mix of comfort, handling, value and safety. Get one - you'll love it !

acura,mdx,2016,Carlos, 08/27/2016,This SUV almost got us hurt,neu,"We got a new 2016 MDX and before it hitting 3 months, our new MDX almost got my whole family hurt (or could have been worst). While driving on the freeway it just suddenly stop while I was changing lane. Luckily the car behind us managed to stop and avoid hitting us. I tried to restart the engine and when it did, it move very slow and roughly to the shoulder of the freeway. After restarting the engine, ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS  came ON including Break System Failure or Malfunction. It scared my whole family and it was the most horrible UNSAFE DRIVE HOME for hours worrying if we still have break system working. Dropped of the MDX at our local dealership and until now (about 9 days now) still trying to figure  things out.. We feel like this vehicle is just so UNSAFE now and it basically traumatized my whole family being in this MDX.  Will review lemon law and make sure we don't become the CRASH TEST DUMMIES for this. And I hate hearing them say ""Oh it must be because of the computers and technology""!.... We got this vehicle because of the SAFETY AND TECHNOLOGY advertised by Acura.

acura,mdx,2016,jl, 09/04/2016,They just can't get it right,neg,"I thought many times before writing this review. I felt that there was no need to let others know about my problems , but my conscience just kept telling me to share my thoughts with the media. When I was driving home the first time from the showroom there was a metal knocking noise under vehicle and was quite concerned. I immediately called my salesman who put me through to service.the manager said there is a bulletin on this but acura had no fix ,but are working on one. i asked how long? and he responded by saying they have been working on it since 2014.I laughed and then choked and said what are you talking about. He said the design of the parking brake cable was not designed correctly and it knocks like a chain hitting the bottom. after quite a few adjustments and the rear brakes overheated from  overtightening the cable, I just gave up and  said I will live with it until acura comes up with a fix. Well, to continue, Ive had countless parking sensor issues that just go off even if no one is around waiting for the red light to change. It sometimes scares me thinking another vehicle is approaching .The only way to shut the sensors off is to override them and shut the system off completely. they removed my bumper 6 times ( damaging the bumper)and replaced modules and sensors and harness and still no fix.The dealers remedy is to just shut them off permanently, even though i bought the advance model to get this option factory installed.My preset steering wheel only works sometimes. My 9 speed tranny clanks ,I guess it wants to let me know its still there . My brakes practically go down to the floor and acura tells me that its ok. Seat adjustments are not great,but i guess acceptable. My rear backup camera looks like I have been driving in a dense fog ( useless) .They say other mdx cameras look similar. The ride quality on smooth roads is fine ,but try hitting a few minor potholes and it goes right through the cabin. While I was even servicing the vehicle a woman was complaining about the terrible ride quality and vowed to sell her mdx just to keep her sanity. There is a scraping noise when you first start the suv in the morning. Might I have to say more. Acura customer relations keeps telling me that they would like to continue working with me to correct these issues after more then 5 attempts ( i stopped counting) and yes I am aware of the lemon law.I said the right thing is to put me in another vehicle and you can continue to correcting these issues on your own and spend 24 hours a day to figure it out so other loyal customers don't suffer. Acura ,unfortunately with being the best selling luxury suv cannot get it right. i guess people gravitate to it because the price is great compared to other similar suvs .Also, acura shares the same mother company as the civic and accord who have held top honors for many year, so people that want luxury and reliability will hopefully get it like the honda products previously mentioned.I am not writing to punish acura  I just want them to get it right. In closing, Maybe I just might just decide to stop punishing myself one day and move on to another brand after owning acura's for many years. I guess Im finally getting wise that taking off a shield on the front grill or giving real wood trim instead of plastic will ultimately not shield this company from customers realizing that there is something wrong here. What acura needs to do instead of fixing a grill issue is to fix mechanical issues that are the real reason why people have always purchased honda products in the first place called reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Jim Wickstrom, 01/06/2016,Dealer invoice is BS! Love my 2016 AWD Acura MDX!,pos,"Three days after we purchased the Acura MDX, we drove it 500 miles to Lake Tahoe through blizzards!  The AWD works better than my 4/4 Toyota Sequoia!  We passed cars, trucks with chains.  .stuck! We drove right though.  At one point in time we were up to our door panels in snow!   On the way up we got 24 mpg and on the way home to San Diego, 28 mpg, thanks to a nine speed transmission and half the cylinders shutting down on cruise control!  It is unbelievable how well this works with 290 hp to boot.  Consumer reports rated this vehicle an 89 rating, tops in the luxury mid size SUV category. To be clear, we looked at SUVs from Porsche, BMW, MB, Lexus but none of them have the top rating and best repair service record as the Acura MDX.   BTW, if you are buying a car, ""bait' each dealership against each other. That is how we got this MDX for $44,500 when list was $50,250!  Do not believe the ""dealer invoice"" number as it is fabricated.  You should be able to beat dealer invoice by at least a grand!  As it seems, even Edmunds believes this BS dealer invoice number, too. Oops!

acura,mdx,2016,SideStepping, 10/10/2016,Could have been a Homerun,neu,"Owners should know, and DEMAND, that early 2016 models built in 2015 have a software update to the transmission, technical service builletin 15-054, which changes the shifting dynamic of the car, and SHOULD resolve most of the transmission jerkiness issues.  Unfortunately, my dealership didn't apply the update, BUT next time my car is in for service, I will DEMAND they fix it, because I too, experience rough shifting, surges while braking and going downhill, and poor overall transmission performance.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE ON THE TRANSMISSION.  ACURA, ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?  Acura should be embarrassed to turn away customers.  No wonder they are LAST in customer satisfaction.  Now...onto the car.  Two major issues with this car: the transmission, and the infotainment system. The interior is nice size and comfortable, even though it doesn't feel so luxurious.  Handling is great, ride is smooth when the transmission isn't jerking you all over the place.  The overall infotainment system, navigation included, is SO slow and my 2008 Infiniti G35 had a better nav system.  It's pretty pathetic.  This is my first (and probably last) Acura until they get their act together, stop trying to fool customers into thinking their product is the ""best in it's class,"" and until they produce a real transmission and a real infotainment system.  What a shame.  BTW, my dad had 3 MDXs...a 2009, a 2013, and a 2016.  He loved (and so did I) the 2009 and 2013.  He had the 2016 for 5 months and got rid of it.  That's how embarrassing of a vehicle it is.  But, I'm sure Acura is laughing all the way to the bank...what a joke of a 50K car.

acura,mdx,2016,Sack, 01/08/2016,First Acura MDX,pos,"We just picked this up last week without even having the intention of buying an Acura.  We originally looked hard into the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilots but realized the lease incentives were absolutely horrible due to the demand of both of those (we are in a spot in our lives where leasing makes more sense).  We started to look into non-3rd row options since our youngest is 2 and we have another one on the way in June, and we could go for a 3rd row when they got older. So I noticed a lease deal on an Acura RDX and wanted to investigate since we didn't like the RAV4 and CR-V options.  The RDX drove well but was too small.  The salesperson told me about a lease deal on a base MDX so we test drove it and LOVED IT.  The features are the same and the quality is better than the higher trim Highlander and Pilots and the lease payment was cheaper per month.  It has heated seats, leather, moonroof, backup camera, dual cabin screens, a 3rd row, jewel eye LED headlights, among other options.

My wife has been driving is most of the time but so far we love it.  Definitely give it a shot if you're open to lease and are considering Toyota/Honda 3rd rows - you'd be surprised on payments.

acura,mdx,2016,Debbie, 11/13/2016,Transmission is still bad!,neg,"I purchased a 2016 Acura MDX from Jay Wolfe Honda in Kansas City, MO a year ago and so far my total overall experience is a ""0"" I had my car in the shop for about 20% of the time I had owned it in the first 5 months and my last repair (5 months after my purchase) was to replace the transmission with 10,000 miles on the vehicle! It still shifts jerky at low speed.  I didn't get any satisfaction from the dealership or with Acura - they told me I would have to pursue arbitration.  I don't have the time and energy for that process so I will drive it for a year or so two and then trade it in.  I had a loud noise in the rear end, after they replaced the struts (after 3 repair attempts) and it is better. There are 3 Service Bulletins out there for those of you who want to try them TSB No 16-035 replace rear suspension dampers and rear upper mount bushings. TSB No 15-039 Replace transmission end cover gaskets TSB No 15-054 Software update in powertrain and transmission control modules.  I called Acura and none of these were linked to my specific vehicle VIN #.  Had they replaced the gaskets, I may not have had a fluid leak which supposedly caused the transmission replacement. The module update is supposed to correct the shifting - it didn't. The rear end work did help the noise in the rear end.  The fan blower for the air conditioner is so loud that even on the lowest speed, phone calls sound like you have your window rolled down.  The blue tooth quality is very poor - lot's of noise and tunnel sound even with nothing turned on in the car.  I could continue with minor detail issues but suffice to say I WOULD NOT purchase nor would I recommend anyone to purchase an Acura MDX!!

acura,mdx,2016,Very disappointed, 10/31/2015,2016 MDX vibration,neg,"I bought a 2016 Acura MDX within the first week I noticed a vibration between 55 to 75 mph, at 459 miles I took it in to the dealer to install the mounding I had purchased and told them it had a vibration they balanced the tires. It did not solve the problem, took it back a second time where I was told by the service writer that there was nothing wrong with the car, I would find nothing wrong with it and it drives just as well as any car on the lot. You can visibly see the steering wheel shake and feel the vibration. I took it in a third time, took a service technician out with me, he witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating. So I asked, ok we are in agreement that you witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating he said yes, I took his name and wrote it down along with date and time. The dealer had my car for about a week, which they did give me a loaner, they called and said they had figured it out, they replaced the brake rotors. Needless to say the vibration is still there, since then I have taken it to a tire store that told me I had three bad tires, took it back to the dealer, they road force balanced the tires, vibration is still there. I have been in contact with Acura Client Relations since the second service appointment, next step is meeting with the District Service Manager. Not to mention how the transmission shifts, I am hoping they come out with a software update for that. Needless to say I am very disappointed and regret purchasing the MDX.

acura,mdx,2016,frustrated, 04/14/2016,"6,800 miles, new transmission required?!",neg,"The transmission on this car is just crap.  I bought it brand new and didn't notice shifting problems on the test drive. I obviously should have test driven the same vehicle multiple times before purchasing it because after about three days I noticed the occasional awkward shifting.  I just told myself it's a brand new car and needs to adjust on its own. I feel like it did get better after a few months - or I just got used to the awkwardness. Sport mode was not even an option as it was super jerky and completely annoying.  At 6,800 miles it suddenly started making a high-pitched chirping noise when shifting into second gear, almost like the sound of tires screeching when peeling out. I immediately drove it to the dealership and the technician confirmed the issue. The next day they called and said the transmission needed to be replaced.  What!? I've owned several Hondas over the years and never had major issues. I thought I could trust Acura for their reliability record, but apparently not. The 2016 Touring/Elite models of the Pilot have the same crappy transmission and complaints are well documented. I hope Honda/Acura will take some responsibility for the defect and offer a recall. If not, I will be pursuing a lemon law buy back.

acura,mdx,2016,amit shakya, 09/13/2016,JERKY RIDE!!!!,neg,"I decided to lease a 2016 MDX. It currently has about 700 miles and Oh man!!! what a dissapointment. The car jerks going from gear 1 to gear 2 and also to gear 3. It is something that you are not supposed to feel on a $50k vehicle.....I have also checked with few of my buddies that own mdx. They have the same feeling about the gear shifting......What a bummer!!!
"
acura,mdx,2016,VJ, 03/03/2017,Transmission issue on brand new MDX,neg,"Purchased a brand new 2016 MDX and within 10 months started having problem with the transmission - jerking with sharp squeaking sound whenever gears shifted (lower gear). Had driven only around 9500 miles when this problem started. Dealership replaced the transmission, but then also changed the radiator and the starter (since those also apparently had issues !) - all this took almost a month. In short, major components were bad/poor quality (?) in a brand new car - only major remaining part to replace is the engine !!! After the repairs, car still gives slight jerk during gear shifts. Dealership and Corporate customer service response was - slight jerk is normal for MDX. So buyers beware - from personal experience it seems Honda quality is not transferred to its luxury brand !!! Consider alternatives & do your research before spending your dollars....
"
acura,mdx,2016,Not Happy, 12/01/2015,Vibrations!,neg,"I had also recently purchased the MDX and had the same vibrations as the previous post.  The story is the same - changed wheels, changed rotors, then balanced the tires.  They also decided to deflate the tires to mask the vibrations.  But I immediately caught them doing this and asked the dealer to  inflate the tires back to 35psi.  Acura is no help either.  Both Acura and dealership say this is normal variation of the MDX, and the lemon law does not apply since ""there is nothing wrong with the car"".  Seeing the prior post, this seems like a fraud or cover up.  Anyone else having this issue?
Finally the transmission is scary. It doesn't always shift to the correct gear.

acura,mdx,2016,KLance, 05/18/2016,Jerky Transmission + Clunky Shifting = last Acura,neg,"Background: Purchased this 2016 model in May of 2015 - have driven for a year.  Thud/clunk noise e-v-e-r-y time I accelerate from around 40 to a higher speed.  Head mechanic at dealer acknowledged this shouldn't be happening, had my car for weeks, put in a new drive train.  Problem still there so then they told me that all of the MDXs do this.  Wait-what??  Engine will shut off when I stop, every single time I stop, unless I deactivate the fuel saving feature.  Get in the car in the AM, deactivate, go to grocery, get back in car, deactivate, stop to get gas, get back in car, deactivate.  You can see how irritating this becomes on a daily basis.  Dealer tells me no way to get around this.  Driver's side window rattles when it's about 1/3 of the way down.  After my first month of driving this car, transmission made a thud noise when in reverse (dealer was able to fix this).  Very jerky ride at slow speeds (i.e., pulling slowly out of my driveway or rounding a corner).  Lots of ""cool"" touch screen controls -- until you realize that you can't just turn a knob to change the AC or heat, you have to hit the control screen multiple times.  Even my husband, who loves everything tech, complains about what a pain this is.  When you shift gears, rolls forward or backward quite a bit so don't you dare park too close to anything.  And there are other smaller things that make driving this vehicle every day unpleasant.  My car history: every 3-5 yrs, when a typical manuf. warranty runs out, I get a new car (I've been hit more than once so I'm very concerned about safety) and this is the WORST car I've ever owned.  I hate it.  What am I comparing it to?  Going way back to my Honda Passport, Mercedes ML350, Mazda MPV, Subaru Tribeca, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Volvo XC60 (all of them high-end models w lots of features).  This vehicle may get a great review after being test driven once for a car website, but check online and see how disappointed all of us owners are who have to drive it every day.

acura,mdx,2016,Mike, 10/26/2015,Great Vehicle with Terrible Infotainment,pos,"We recently leased a 2016 MDX AWD with Tech Package. If we were to do it again the smart money would be the base awd model with the AcuraWatch safety feature package. Let me explain why....First off the car rides, accelerates, stops, turns, and everything else regarding moving extremely well. Even the headlights are exceptional. The interior seating design and the way they slide  is also great. The safety features shake the steering wheel if you depart your lane and warn you when other cars are too close.  Whats left is the way you interact with the controls in the dash and on the steering wheel. Every single thing about the interaction with the controls is unnecessarily complicated. In many cases it takes an extra click or 2 in a menu than in other cars. For example to turn seat heater on you need to click a button on the screen, select the heat level, then close the sub-menu. In every other car on the planed you click the button once to turn on the seat heat then another click to change the heating level. I consider this annoying, but not a deal breaker. Then you get into the gps. The gps takes longer than most to figure out how to do the basics. Its cumbersome to enter an address. The guidance is also poor. Sometimes there is no audible instruction on when to turn and a strange map of your turn with a flag that isn't always oriented the way you are travelling.  To sum it up you are better off placing your phone with google maps over the nav screen. I can only hope there is some kind of update to enable android auto or the apple car os. Last but not lease the Bluetooth connectivity doesn't play nice with my samsung galaxy s6. Every 30 seconds or so it pops up an error it can't import the phonebook. A quick google search indicates this is a common issue for many.  Then you quickly find out the text interaction is terrible. When you get a text a notification takes over the entire screen asking what you want to do (imagine you were getting ready to make a turn following gps). So then when you act on the notification you have to pick from a very small list of predefined reply messages. Every other car I have used including cheap rentals allow you to speak a text reply. My other vehicle is 2015 ram 3500 with uconnect and it does all of this with no issues.  In a day and age where so much of your interaction with a vehicle is the electronics acura needs to do a much better job. The kicker is you pay thousands extra for this tech package and get terrible tech bundled with some really good safety features. After having the MDX a few months I can say I would buy it again, but would not get anything above a base model awd with acurawatch.

acura,mdx,2016,CFM, 08/23/2015,2016 Acura MDX AWD,pos,"We finally bought our new SUV or I guess they call it a crossover. Keep in mind we only have a few hundred miles on it so its still really early. We looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the MDX. As far as a luxury 7 passenger vehicles go this seemed to have everything we wanted and needed after a couple of weeks of shopping and doing serious looking at the German counter parts. The MDX meets all of our requirements as follows in no specific order. Luxurious, stylish, roomy, safe, quality. We hope the maintenance is low and that it will hold its resale value I guess time will tell. The ride is great in the awd however on bumpy roads you can hear some road noise. The steering is awesome The turning radius is amazing making u-turns a breeze. This is a very easy and stress free vehicle to drive. Unlike most of the reviews I have read the command center is easy to operate we were a little worried after reading the reviews but it is super simple! We thought we wanted the black on black but after looking at the Lunar Silver Metallic we fell in love with how it really accentuates the lines on the vehicle.

acura,mdx,2016,kris reilly, 03/13/2016,Always Acura?! Maybe not,pos,"Always head right to the Acura dealer when we need a car! Have an older Acura MDX that I love!!! The new Acura looks nice, handles well but seems a bit smaller inside (although I was told it is a few inches bigger) the head room in the third row is cut back because of the angle of the body. This limits who is able to sit back there. It is very jerky in the shifting while excelerating and if you are moving very slow it feel like you are not in gear...Not happy with that! In addition, the radio is horrible. Most stations that I listen to do not come in clear. I have no problem with this in my other Acura or even the car I had before this one. Clearly the antenna is not good! I just feel like from my old Acura (2005) to this one (2016) they have definiately cut corners and the quality is not as good! For the price you pay I would expect an all 5 star rating which I can not give. We have been loyal Acura cutomers but think that this may be it for me. I am able to get more perks from other vehicles for the same or lesser price. I will be shopping around for my next vehicle!
"
acura,mdx,2016,Steve Chang, 04/13/2016,"Overall, this SUV is a good compromise",pos,"After driving this vehicle for 12k mile, I think this vehicle is a good compromise. It's not as sporty as a BMW X5, not as big/bold as a Chevy Tahoe, not as pretty/sexy as an Audi Q5, but its (fully loaded) price is most likely the lowest in this group, its fuel efficiency is good (I averaged almost 21 mpg with mostly city driving, and about 28 mpg on highway), has very large cargo area (if you fold down the 3rd row), a quiet/comfortable ride, handles impresively on snow, and it comes with almost all the safety features that you can imagine.

A few major gripes:
1) Watch out for the middle seat's seatbelt (a real safety hazard, and a major design flaw) - since the seatbelt automatically retracts to the roof where it is anchored, my mom was hit hard on her face (by the seat belt buckle) as the middle passenger released his seatbelt.
2) On a two-lane windy road, the auto collision sensor can mistaken an oncoming vehicle (in the other lane) as an obsticle and suddenly hit the brake for you (which can be very scarely to anyone in the vehicle)
3) Unimpressive accleration for a 3.5L VTECH engine.
4) So-so brake performance
5) Lacks a ""360 degree camera"" which I believe is an option for other countries (since the owner's manual talks about it)
6) No way to program the vehicle to ""remember"" the heated seat settings, which can be very annoying in cold climates
7) Interia material is OK, but not in the same league with the Germans
8) Why an SUV requires premium fuel??

acura,mdx,2016,CaryRaleigh, 11/02/2016,"MDX has major problem, Please read before buying",neg,"I have bought a brand new Acura MDX in February, 2016. My experience with my new Acura MDX is pretty bad so far.
On June 20th, I had the first experience of the problem with dashboard showing that there is Transmission, Emission, and all other system problem. The car stopped on the road. Later it started but continue to flash the warnings.
This same problem occurred second time on September 6th and at the time, I was starting the car and it won't even start. Later it started but continue to flash the warnings. I took the car to Acura dealership on these both occasions and it shows up later.
Again, Third time it happened on October 30th. Checkout the https://community.cartalk.com/t/dashboard-showing-that-there-is-transmission-emission-and-all-other-system-problem/96331 for multiple people reporting the issue. Please think hard before you sink in 50K for this car.

acura,mdx,2016,Loren, 05/31/2016,"New Transmission at 6,000 Miles!!!!!!",neg,"I began leasing this 2016 in December of 2015.  After 5 months and about 6,000 miles I noticed a ""clunk"" sound only on the upshift between 20 and 30 MPH.  Took it to the dealer and had a test drive with service manager.  He hears the sound and says ""I have never heard that sound before!""  I actually let him drive the car so he could hear and feel what sound it was making.  Sure enough they want to replace the whole transmission.  I was told something about a seal allowing some fluid into the transmission.  This is not what I would have anticipated for a car that costs this much!  Very disappointed, this is going to be a very long lease period that cannot wait for it to end.

acura,mdx,2016,Diana S, 09/17/2016,"Transmission Failed at 5,000 miles",neg,"Do NOT buy this car.  We replaced our 2013 MDX with the 2016 and wish we had the old one back.  This car is a dud.  Do not buy it.  We were driving on the expressway going 65 mph and the transmission catastrophically failed.  So glad we had just went through a 1 lane stretch on 75 undergoing construction and were able to pull over to the side of the road.  Dealership was awesome, but this car is terrible.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Peter K., 10/26/2015,The vehicle that's gone from great to a total dud,neg,"I hardly ever write any reviews but figured I just had to do one on this vehicle. I owned a 2010 MDX Tech, which was a great car, that unfortunately got flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Then, I got an ML350 and when the lease was up, we decided that we needed another 7-seat vehicle. So, as we'd already had an MDX before, we figured we couldn't go wrong with that one, right? Wrong! 
The first thing I noticed on my drive home from the dealership is that the car becomes ridiculously jerky while in traffic. The new 9-speed transmission just doesn't work well for daily city driving or when you're stuck in traffic on a highway. If you live in a rural area, chances are you'll never experience this. But if you're in traffic every day, well... you've been warned. I've adjusted my driving style since then and learned that switching IDS to ""Comfort"" makes it a little better. The problem, however, never went away and the dealer refused to acknowledge its existence despite the fact that Acura message boards are filled with similar complaints (I should have read those before I got the car).
Then, there's the touch screen. It's very slow with a non-intuitive interface. I've had it lock up several times while selecting a route.
I've always played my music from a USB flash drive and this is another area where this car is a total disaster. Once music is on, you can't switch tracks until the car's MP3 system is done reading the whole drive. So, it takes about 2-3 minutes in my case before I can switch songs or select another album/artist. It could be my flash drive but it's the same one I used on the 2010 and ML350 - worked flawlessly there.
We have two car seats installed in the second row (one behind the driver's seat and another in the middle). It's impossible to pull down the remaining second row seat and access the third row when there's a car seat in the middle. I had no problem doing that in the ML (needed the remaining seat pulled down sometimes to transport my bicycle).
Finally, there's the cargo net or lack thereof. I kept the cargo net from the 2010 and was able to easily install it on the ML. I figured it would also fit on the 2016 MDX. Wrong again! Acura has changed that as well.

acura,mdx,2016,Daniel, 10/13/2015,"Not what I had hoped for $50,000+",neu,"It came down to the 2016 Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, BMW X5, and 2015 Toyota Highlander.  We were inclined to get the XC90 for all the safety features & the incredibly cool look. The drive is great, however it felt really risky getting a brand new everything car.  The dealer had been saying they would get in Jan, the first ones did not appear till May and it seemed like they were trying to get it right.  Visibility was ok.  However, loaded with all the safety features it was getting to 60  though it starts at $47 all cars had very confusing option packages & what is considered a safety feature.  The test car 3rd row seat seem to have a problem. Then they recalled the vehicle to fix the third row airbags. We keep cars for 10 years & did not want to be going back to the dealer over and over again. The final straw is when they were offering factory maintenance for all models except the XC90 which had 1 year less of the maintenance.  On a new model they should not insert more doubt.  The BMW drove great but the 3rd row was not big enough for anyone over the age of 12 so had to cross it off.  The highlander felt less luxurious but most importantly did not have all the safety systems that we were looking for so we decided to pass. At the time the 2016 was not out, it appears from the reviews that they have added some safety features. We were left with the pilot and the MDX. In the end, the Pilot's cheap minivan arm rest on the drivers side along with the bad handling and turning radius on turns made us skip it.   Any man over 200 pounds will find there is no way to lean on the arm rest comfortably.  The turning handling and radius were a big concern also as on a sharp turn near our house the car veered into the oncoming traffic lane.  We did it twice.   Finally, unless you get the highest trim the handling is so ""trucky"" the kids got out and were ready to throw up.   This left us with the MDX.  We were excited to be moving up in the luxury ranks and were hoping the reliability would be there also.  After a bad selling experience we picked up the car and immediately noticed things.  There is a paint defect under the clear coat on the roof. There was a sticker there so it was clearly a known problem and they sold to us anyway. We have complained with no response. The hood does not latch unless you slam it.  If the hood is already down there is no way to close it without opening it and slamming it.  Finally if you look around the car you can see multiple places where the rubber is not flush including the doors & hood.  I walked around the lot and would say 50% of the cars had the same problem. Not what we had expected at $50+ .  Dealer was no help with these issues, I have read on line about cars getting water on the inside I am hoping that the rubber problems will not cause that. When you go to the car wash & open the back doors there is water in the painted part.  As for the drive it is pretty good, the 9 speed transmission is a little bouncy especially as low speeds, but no one is getting dizzy at least. The stop start feature takes getting used to, as if you need immediate power like turning onto a highway of making a left turn onto oncoming traffic, the car will hesitate long enough to make it dangerous.  You have to turn the wheel of take your foot of the pedal to start the car & be ready to go, or turn the feature off, however if you do that I can't imagine how much worse the gas mileage it would be. We are getting 15.5 in the city, & its Premium so it has been surprising.   Power in the SHAWD is very good & its a quiet ride with good handling.  Seat comfort for a large driver is not as good as I would have hoped.  I would like the seat to go back more when its high up and it just wont, so you end up sitting kind of low which removes one of the benefits of and SUV.  As for the safety features the lane assist works well on a
 Interstate highways at high speed, not so good in other settings. The automatic follow feature is very sensitive and breaks really hard and speeds up hard, so much so that you can't use it.  The break alert system works ok, I wish it would also go on if I am breaking but not hard enough. It will not stop the car automaticlally at low speeds like the volvo. The heads up display in bright sun creates a distracting reflection on the winshield & and the pairing with SIRI does not work well.  The NAV is a complete waste of money, I wish I could convert the screen to show my iphone instead. Nav traffic & directions sub par in every way.  The voice input is the same as our 08 Accord, very clunky. AC is hard to keep constant, need to adjust all the time.  In the end we are very disappointed with what we hoped would be an amazing car.  We hope it lives up to the reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Ron, 07/01/2016,After 2 months...Love this MDX!,pos,"I researched the the 2016 MDX for 9 months before buying. I'm so glad I did. I've owned two MDX's since purchasing my first MDX in year one of the MDX introduction in 2001. I'm amazed at the transformation, I'd been driving my MDX with 180K miles. Having also been an RL owner, I now feel I have the best of both vehicles in one. The slightly lowered height from the road is just perfect! The few lower reviews of the entertainment system has not been a problem for me. There's a lot to digest with so many great features, I take each feature one at a time which for me has been an enjoyable easy process. I love the new touch gear shifting! I love the sportier drive for an SUV, it really does not feel like I'm driving an SUV. The gas mileage increase is sweet, which is one reason I waited so long to buy a 2016. Love the seat air ventilation system that keeps me from back sweating during hot summer months. I can now seamlessly play music from my iPhone. The biggest surprise and enjoy is the warning system and lane keeping assist system. I feel like I'm now protected from blind spots when changing lanes and drifting out of my lane. This is simply the best vehicle I have ever owned! A huge leap of comfort, safety and technology in the past 10 years! I've never experienced this big of an upgrade in any vehicle I have ever purchased. Love this vehicle!!!

acura,mdx,2016,Don Thomas, 11/03/2015,Surge on,neu,"This transmission is awful!  Take your foot off the gas going down a hill and the car surges rather than slow down. Have to step on the brakes hard to slow it down.  Same issue when downshifting with the paddles.  

Also stutters when going into drive.

Voice commands are a joke.  I say find nearest ATM.  She says turn air conditioner up.  And so it goes.

This is my third MDX but it is my last.

acura,mdx,2016,:(, 05/04/2016,Problem in two week after 630 miles,neg,"These is the list of problems that I had after two weeks (630 miles) 
The Car is in service center.

1. Navigation problem with failed HDD - take about week to fix
2. Transmission,  The ride is jerky at low speed - service told me that never reported as problem  and not fix for it. 
3. Back up camera feed is showing for long time after driving forward - They will try to fix it.

* Dealer told me nothing wrong with transmission and try different settings might fix the problem which means no solution and no fix.
*  I had 4 Honda/Acura  before Prelude, Pilot, CL, RL and this time I am so disappointed.  Maybe no more Honda/Acura in the future.

This is follow up on the fix.
* Dealer service department call me after 1.5 weeks after I drop off the car about a problem with audio system.   Now waiting for new audio system to arrive.
   Mean time the loaner car is making squeaking sounds and this car has only 3800 miles.  I hope other people have better luck with this car.

acura,mdx,2016,Terry, 05/25/2016,Terrible Transmission,neg,"I have had the car for 7,000 miles now. The transmission is very jerky. There are times when making a right turn going from high to low speed and trying to get the car back up to speed is a pain. I have to push the accelerator much harder around turns and the car struggles to find a gear. For a luxury car, this is not acceptable. The drive is not fun at all and the service department at Weir Canyon Acura said this is the way the car drives. I have called Acura directly to log a complaint. Contact them directly so they can fix this issue. I don't think I would buy another Acura again.

acura,mdx,2016,Heather, 04/26/2016,Mostly OK with the SUV - terrible transmission!,neg,"Mostly this car is OK for the price.  But the transmission is terrible and has an odd shift that makes it uncomfortable to drive and for passengers.  No matter what ""mode"" you're in.  It's been in the shop twice now for this problem and we just keep hearing - it is what it is.  Which is frustrating given how much we are paying for it.  The Acura service department we also have been going to is less than stellar at communication and makes us even more frustrated with the car.  I loved, loved, loved my first Acura many  years ago - but I do not think I will be purchasing / leasing another one anytime soon.

acura,mdx,2016,Krang, 11/06/2016,Transmission went after 15k,neg,"I have had my SUV in for repairs several times. Window would go up and down. In the fourth try they almost fixed it. It doesn't just go down on its own any longer. It just doesn't stay up if you roll it down. It takes about 4-5 tries. The USB ports don't work. They said it's my phone, I have had 6 chargers and a new phone since my purchase. The computer/transmission has been in 3 times. They claimed it was a computer issue with shifting. However when my car failed to go over 30 MPH. I called, their response was there is no engine light on, there is no problem. However after my car being there for a week, they called to let me know the transmission is faulty and needs to be replaced. I called my sales rep (who we've used for 5 cars) to see if he could swap my car out for a similar one. He didn't help and told me to call Acura and file a complaint. He also said they will not do anything to help you. Extremely disappointed after spending 50k on a lemon. I did plan on purchasing this car at the end of the lease.

acura,mdx,2016,brianc, 01/24/2017,I can't believe this is an Acura...,neg,"After owning 5 Accords, 2 Odysseys, 1 CRV and a Pilot without any issues, I figured the next logical step was Acura. We test drove and almost bought a Ford Explorer Sport, but the Honda loyalist inside of me said the Acura would be a better overall purchase. From the moment we leased this MDX 6 months ago it has been a HUGE let down. The transmission is horrible and shifts almost violently (dealer said this is normal), the suspension pops and clunks on every bump (3 attempts by dealer to fix), the touch screen is cool in theory, but when you just want to turn on the seat heater or adjust the fan it takes far too much effort.  The cargo area is poorly designed (in my opinion) because the roof slopes in the rear and limits capacity. The seats seem to be okay; they are a little small for my 6'3"" frame but my wife finds the car comfortable. On the plus side, the ride on the freeway is compliant and gas mileage is phenomenal (although, keep in mind you have to use premium fuel which offsets some of the MPG savings). I love the LED headlamps, but more and more cars are adding this feature, which makes is less special on the Acura. Remote starter was standard on my Accord, but we had to pay $400 extra for it on the Acura. Overall, the car looks much better than it performs. I never thought I would say this about a Honda product, but if you are in the market for a midsize SUV, do yourself a favor and drive several other vehicles...this Acura just doesn't live up to it's name.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Adam Stiles, 01/08/2019,Overall a great vehicle,pos,"I read all the reviews about the 9speed transmission prior to buying a CPO MDX with 12,500 miles on it.  I knew full well it’s drawbacks and limitations.  For most of my driving life I have driven manual transmission vehicles.  Now at a different stage of my life I need an SUV.  I am a discerning driver that generally notices every bump, rattle, hesitation, or jerky behavior.  I have owned vehicles with automatic transmissions and even won a lemon law case against a Jeep largely because of problems with that part of the car.  I find the transmission of this MDX to be pretty good, and much better than I anticipated.  It shifts pretty quickly, for the most part smoothly, and helps the car be very efficient.  Occasionally it can be caught flat footed or give a rough shift, but virtually every automatic transmission can.  I have learned how to compensate for this.  If you need to accelerate to pass, floor it and you can back off if needed.  The computer sends the message and the car drops gears pretty quickly.  Putting the IDS into sport mode helps some too.  My car came with the software update and I think it’s logic is pretty good.  Others Abe driven my car and nobody balls at the transmission.

As for the rest of the car, it is pretty well thought out.  I get 21-22mpg around suburban town and on the open highway have crested 28mpg on a trip average.  I think those are impressive numbers for a powerful AWD SUV.  Cargo space is very useable and generous.  Seating is comfy, especially on long hauls.  The ELS stereo is phenomenal, provided you adjust the settings (I dialed up the bass and subwoofer).  This car is also whisper quiet on the open road - everyone that is in my car notices this.  For a biggish SUV it handles well and accelerates quickly.  Visibility from the drivers seat is excellent.  The headlights are also top notch.

One of my bigger concerns was the much aggrieved infotainment system.  It almost stopped me from buying the car.  I’m reality, you get used to it and it’s not as bad as I expected.  If you have an iPhone, Siri Eyes Free lets you text and call people easily.  I put the climate control on AUTO and simply set the temp to what I want.  The fan, vent direction, and seats adjust.  The NAVI works well.  I was disappointed that entry was disabled while the vehicle is moving.  However, I prefer to enter it by voice, which now uses a natural address.

My complaints with this car are minimal.   I don’t like the funky wide angle driver side mirror.  I don’t think I will ever get used to it.  The adaptive cruise control is rough.  I don’t love it and most of the time just disable it in situations where it’s claim is to be useful.  Lastly, I think the brakes are a little underwhelming.  I had them resurfaced under warranty shortly after delivery.  They are ok but I still sometimes think I feel pulsing.

Overall, I think it is a very well rounded car.  I am very happy with it and would definitely buy another one."
acura,mdx,2016,Joey, 12/12/2015,Smooth like a weedwacker,neg,"What happened to Acura?  It used to be a luxury brand!  The 9 speed transmission cannot figure out what gear to be in.  And the ride is very bouncy!  Lot of vibrations when driving on the highway.  If you plan on spending $50k, I would look elsewhere."
acura,mdx,2016,bluehvn, 12/06/2016,Lipstick on a pig,neg,"This car has all of the creature comforts.   Good handling, comfortable interior, quiet on the inside, great gas mileage for an SUV.   None of those things matter, because these vehicles have BAD TRANSMISSIONS!    Have you ever been in a car with someone who is learning to drive a stick shift?   That's the way this car shifts in low gears.  It bucks, snorts, hesitates, and can't decide what gear to be in.  If you are coasting down a hill, it surges and accelerates.  Driving in bumper to bumper rush hour traffic was like wrestling a bear.  More than once I thought I had been rear-ended in slow moving traffic.....nope, just the car shifting.   I had the car back to the dealership 4 times.  They couldn't get their stories straight.   The Salesman told me it could not possibly be doing what I described and dismissed me.  The Service Manager said ""yeah, I've had 14 of those in here doing the same thing this week.  That's' just the way they drive"".   The District Manager told me that the car was hunting for the right gear to save me money on gasoline.   After 20 years of driving Acuras, I will never again be a customer.  I traded the car with 10,000 miles on it and took a huge financial loss.

acura,mdx,2016,I drive a death trap!, 10/04/2018,Death Trap On Wheels,neg,"I have been going round & round with Acura for months with nothing resolved. Since leasing the MDX in 2016 shifting & transmission has been horrible. That was an annoyance! Acura sent out a letter stating that it 2016 MDX were experiencing linkage issues. I called the dealership (that was 3 hours from my house) - the service department stated this was something they could only assess during the week. No exceptions! I explained that I was driving in and would need to have this looked at over the weekend. I was told there was not deadline on this warranty issue & to call when I would be available during the week.  The hard shifting/ jerking only continued to increase and have intermittent times of briefly losing power while driving. Several months later ( after moving closer to a dealership) - I took the vehicle in to the service department. No one has knowledge of the letter that was sent out to the consumer. They told me that resetting the software would take care of the issues.  ABSOLUTELY NOT - THEY ARE WORSE!! Several weeks after resetting the software - I was driving 75/80 mph on interstate passing a semi & traffic behind me and my MDX lost power. I would push on the accelerator and nothing! This was completely terrifying for me & my daughter who was in the passenger seat. Within 20 seconds or so - power kicked back in. The only positive in this situation is I was on a 4 lane interstate and not passing someone on a 2 lane highway.  I took the vehicle into another Acura dealership and left it for a couple of days. They tried everything and can not get a diagnostic read on the computer.  So - I know have a $40,000 vehicle parked in my driveway waiting for the lease to expire. As Acura has made very clear - without diagnostics - there is nothing wrong with the vehicle.  This vehicle is no longer a nuisance to drive - but a safety issue for my family & everyone else on the road.  Acura has been more than accommodating to release me another vehicle and let me out of my lease on the 2016 MDX.  NO THANK YOU!! I am now in the process of filing a complaint with my State Attorney General and contacting my personal attorney.  Apparently Acura does not care about the safety of the consumers driving/riding in their products or their liability of sticking their head in the sand and ignoring their issues. Google 2016 MDX complaints & you will see that I am not alone!!

acura,mdx,2016,Chris, 08/02/2016,Disappointed With the Test Drive,neu,"I've owned 3 MDXs--2005, 2010, 2014 and I've loved them all. Each of those years I test drove  a variety of SUVs  (the usual suspects) and always ended up with the Acura!  So when the 2017 Acura hit the showroom last week, I was pretty sure I would end up buying another one.  It's not going to happen.  Took it for a test ride and noticed immediately how differently it shifted when accelerating onto a highway.   Couldn't get out of its own way--that's the way it feels anyway.  Back in the showroom the salesperson told me they changed the gears from 6 to 9 back in 2016.  I have no idea what that means I only know that the car doesn't feel right going through NINE gears.  Like I'm towing a boat or something.  It has the power; it just takes too long to get to it.  What a shame--just when they finally changed the front grill.

acura,mdx,2016,Tom, 01/07/2016,Nice ride but a few issues,neu,"We have leased this SUV for 2 years. It has been a pleasure to drive. The ride is generally smooth and comfortable. The infotainment system is not very intuitive, can be annoying at times, and the bluetooth does not work seamlessly, in comparison to our 2017 Toyota Tacoma and 2016 RAV4.  We have had minor transmission problems that caused the vehicle to jerk forward when near idling at very low speeds. That problem seems to have been fixed with a computer system reboot. However, we have had intermittent tailgate malfunctions that the dealer to this point has been unable to resolve. At this point we haven't decided on whether to purchase at the end of the lease. We probably will not switch to a lease on a new MDX considering that Consumer Reports no longer recommends the MDX based on lower than average reliability.

acura,mdx,2016,Karen, 08/05/2016,The Money Trap,neg,"I looked for a new car for months and decided on this nice MDX, only to be left on the side of the road when the transmission broke.  We waited 3 hours for a tow truck to come.  My 2016 MDX had just 3800 miles on it.  I asked for a new transmission, but they said all it needed was a gasket.   I ghad a BMW which I loved, but it had 190,000 miles on it and I wanted dependable transportation for traveling now this is what I am stuck with.  I will say the people at the Acura dealer were very nice, but I did not get great end results.  When you spend that kind of money and this happens they should make it right.

The 3rd time, I rode with a service tech and service manager and they heard the noises but said they did not know how to fix it.  When I returned to pick up my car the service invoice coveniently mentioned that they ""could not duplicate the noise"". I got no support from the dealership at all and called Acura Corporate hoping for some better service but no such luck.  They will tell you this very loud noise is a characteristic of the vehicle and likely won't do anything to fix it! Do not buy an Acura MDX!

acura,mdx,2016,Paul Moyer, 08/02/2015,First Acura,pos,"After owning several BMW's, Mercedes, and lastly a Jeep Grand Cherokee, I decided to look at Acura due to its quality reputation and value.  A comparable BMW or Porsche would have cost 20K more.  I was immediately impressed with the comfort, quality, and performance.  Although not as sporty as BMW products I have owned, it drives and corners smartly.  Probably the quietest vehicle I have owned.  After many dealership visits with the Jeep, I look forward to years of routine service only with the Acura.

Rough shifting from idle into first and second. Engine revs up then will often jump from first to third. Very pronounced action.

acura,mdx,2016,Ron, 12/23/2016,Best Vehicle I've Ever Owned,pos,"I've driven the Acura MDX model since it arrived in 2001 and been an Acura owner since 1995. This being my 4th MDX the 2016 is the best driving experience I've ever had. I was a little nervous with the move to a crossover design, happy with the feel of the RL I've missed. The slight one inch lowering to the ground was a concern but still keeps me high enough on the road to see ahead in traffic. The new safety innovations are incredible and give me a new sense of road safety beyond what I've ever experienced. The gas mileage is through the roof beyond what I expected which was my main motivation for buying in May of 2016. I don't get all the transmission complaints, but I must say, I don't drive the car fast, I drive it economically for safety and good gas mileage. For this reason, the car is a dream. If you want a sports car, then go buy one. I love having the option of the engine stopping if you press the brake a tad harder at a stop. At first this was strange, but now a natural part of driving the car. All the technology took a small learning curve but once you learn, it's part of you. My Acura dealership has been completely responsive with any questions I have. The MDX handles beautifully with new smart technology helping to keep me in my lane when driving the freeway. I love the distance setting of three choices when using cruise. I'm not trying to out drive anyone, just selecting my space on the freeway to drive most economically. Hitting 28 miles to the gallon on a long trip is the best MPG I've ever received from any Acura. The sound system and tech package is delivers all I need and then some. This new 2016 MDX delivers the most enjoyable driving experience I've ever had!

acura,mdx,2016,Christopher Trinh, 11/26/2015,Exterior Quality,pos,"Overall it rides nice and very comfortable. The downside is that the Acura MDX has built quality issues. The panels either don't lineup or the gap is not even. For instance, the fuel door is off center, both side of the trunk lift gate have uneven gaps and both side of the front top fender panels are off and don't lineup with the front bumper. Very disappointed and I would consider other brand of SUV such as Lexus in the near future. If you are in the market for any Acura vehicle, do check for quality built issues. Chances are the panels don't lineup and the gaps are not even.

The engine idle stop feature does not work at all after a few miles. In addition, don't even try to connect a smartphone because the vehicle does not recognize it no matter how hard you try. This is not what I anticipated for a new vehicle especially an Acura MDX. 

My conclusion is I would look to other brand of SUV before considering the MDX.

acura,mdx,2016,Shawn Ayers, 05/25/2016,First MDX,pos,"The MDX overall comfort with all the gadets is top notch. If I had to write any negatives about the vehicle would be the lack of fog lights for a near $60K luxury SUV. The other, is merely personal with regards to settling for the MDX as it wasn't our first choice because ""everyone"" seems to have one. On the flip side, after driving the MDX and the overall comfort I see why every seems to be driving an MDX everywhere I look. 

My wife absolutely loves driving it as our family vehicle. It is spacious and very comfortable. I would purchase again!

acura,mdx,2016,Jeff Axup, 09/30/2016,Terrible customer service and tech problems,neg,"Acura customer care refused to return my calls for 8 months when the backup camera was intermittently not functioning. Even after I send videos of it occurring they refused to accept responsibility or communicate. Acura clearly doesn't care about customers after they make the purchase. The navigation system and voice recognition system is really a joke as well. I replaced it with a dash-mounted iPhone. The car does handle well and the all-wheel drive is great.

"
acura,mdx,2016,2016MDX-Owner, 12/11/2017,"Comfortable and spacious, but technology is subpar",neu,"I owned this car for 2 years and have about 45,000 miles on it. First, the good things: the car is spacious, our family of 4 took it on long road trips and it has enough space for all our stuff. It's not as much space as a Honda Pilot, but enough. The car is relatively quiet and has comfortable ride. Inside materials are fine, nothing special, but nice to look at and touch. If I could have this car for $40K, it would be a great deal. The things that are not so great: acceleration, you hit the gas and the car thinks a couple of seconds before deciding to lurch forward, redline and then slowly speed up. The only way to deal with this is floor it when merging on a highway or passing, then the car (most of the time), accelerates straight away and relatively smoothly. I got an advance package with lane assist and distance control. Distance control is 'ok on a highway (but I don't trust it in stop/go traffic). Lane assist is awfully designed, every 30 seconds it shows me to put my hands on the steering wheel (I usually have a couple fingers at the bottom of a steering wheel) and if I don't respond, it silently disengages and car starts to drift, WTF? How about an audible alert or something to tell me it's about to disengage before driving me into a ditch? The only time I use it is on a long stretch of a highway with not many turns or cars around when I can rest my hand on a steering wheel. The whole technology package (navigation, audio, etc.) was clearly outsourced to the lowest bidder in a third world country, in my opinion. Monochrome! button selection with no apps (at least it's touchscreen). My 2012 Toyota has better navigation/audio/apps than this 2016 Acura MDX (Yes, I am one of those folks who wants to listen to Pandora or check a forecast while stuck in traffic). Blutooth is bad too, the car decides to use my phone for making calls and my wife's phone for music, how is it even makes any sense? If you are willing to accept these limitations, MDX is not bad, mostly because it appears reliable and comfortable. Oh, BTW, I got 45,000 miles on a car and tires need to be replaced, so just average life with stock Continental tires.

Update: Edmunds sent me an email asking for an update in 2020, here you go- I am currently at 85,000 miles, this car did not get better with age, both catalytic converters had to be replaced before I even hit 70,000 miles. Thankfully it was under warranty, otherwise its a $2K job, I think I also sunk another $1k-$2k replacing something that's supposed to last for 100,000-150,000 miles but gave way long before that. Otherwise, its normal maintenance. My friends with BMWs and Audis spent more on repairs, though, LoL.

It was ok for about six month then from passenger side middle row some kind of noise (like two plastic or rubbing two seat together) start coming. I try real hard to pin point but can not pin point. Now is about more then eight month I have vehicle and sound is coming everywhere, I don't know what is solution, is that my vehicle only or most mdx? Very very poor acceleration and uneasy shifting. I plan to change with other brand SUV, but before that I am going to take to dealership and/or body shop just for that  noise.

acura,mdx,2016,Wei Li, 09/04/2016,strong smell from leather seat,neg,"I bought a 2016 MDX at Apr 2015. The car has unusual new car smell. At the beginning, I thought it will disappear soon .I am wrong. I can't stay in the car without the window open for more than one year. But unfortunately after two summers, the smell of new car just reduced a little bit and the leather seat still gives off strong chemical odor. I can confirm because if I smell closely to the leather it's just too strong chemical odor. I have owned multiple cars with leather seats before. This is the first time I hit the issue. I very understand that leather products usually has ""leather smell"" and I actually like that. But this smell from ACURA 2016 MDX seats is not typical genuine leather smell. It's just unpleasant chemical smell.  At the time I bought the 2016 MDX, I noticed it smells more strong than 2015 MDX. And it seems to be issue with all 2016 MDX at least the first batches.  I was told by many people that baking the car in summer could reduced the new car smell. Now I have done it twice in the summer. Almost every sunny day I leave the car outside and open the window just a little. I have verified it doesn't work for this car. Because this time, issue is from seat. I am pretty issue besides the seat, the smell is OK. Just the leather chemical smell is too bad. One detail I noticed is there is no smell from back piece of seat. I am guessing that the back piece of the seat has different leather.

acura,mdx,2016,Suzanne Thorpe, 09/16/2015,My first SUV purchase,pos,"I typically drive a vehicle for as long as possible. So when my 2003 Toyota Camry was starting to show some signs of wear and tear after 13 years, I decided to check out the new SUV's.  For me I wanted comfort, quiet, smooth handling, navigation package, something easy enough to get my aging parents into, and most importantly something with a solid reputation of being a reliable and quality vehicle.  My pros: I found that I liked sitting a bit higher on the road. The drive is very comfy, quiet and the vehicle is very responsive.  When I test drove the car I got the speed up to 90 entering the interstate before the salesman in the backseat coughed uncomfortably, but the car never hesitated and was very responsive. The headlights provide an amazing view of the road at night. The bluetooth for phone calls is crystal clear. I am using midgrade octane gasoline and I am averaging 24.5 mpg. My cons: I wish the cup holder was a smidge larger so it could hold my bubba cup of water. The navigation system is a little confusing but now that I am used to it things are fine but it took some patience on my part. The driver seat is self adjusting to driver 1 or 2 but I wish that I could get the seat to automatically move further back than it does upon going into park.  I understand that Acura has accessories for sale but I think that for the amount of $$$ you spend they could have included a net in the cargo area to keep the groceries from sliding around, I think it should have been standard not optional. Overall I really have been impressed so far and have not once regretted my purchase.  I don't have any maintenance issues to report after 4 months of ownership.

acura,mdx,2016,Ram, 08/30/2016,Great hype but no substance,neu,"The folks at dealership are great in service and sales but they cannot solve the issues which are congenital to Acura important one being Jerky transmission , the movement is jerky at low speeds, during accelration and marked in low gear (S). The climate control fans make loud noise . A software update made it worse.  Even the seat memory fails !! Bluetooth cannot recognize my wife's Iphoe 6+!!!. Audio is good.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Bob K, 06/12/2018,9-speed Transmission Needs to Go,neg,"This is my third Acura. I am sorry i bought it.  We purchased a 2016 MDX technology - a non titled dealer loaner in Oct17 with 9800mi.  I cannot stand the jerking shifts the transmission makes when you start off.  It is flat out annoying.  And yes, as I read in reviews, it also lunges a bit when it downshifts right before a stop.  Scarry.  Also, if you use the paddles to downshift manually, the car goes into neutral for long pause between downshifts causing the vehicle to actually speed up (like it is in neutral)  when you want to click down and slow down.  The brakes are also questionable. It seems like there is air in the system.  They really grab well if you hit them a second time every time you are stopping. They don't seem affective if you don't.  We are also amazed how little drink holder utility there is.  Don't think about leaving with two drinks - ie coffee and water.  The USB ports are also extremely difficult to plug into.  This vehicle also need a new driver door seal as wind noise rushes in next to the drivers left ear.  And finally, good luck acclimating to the nav system.  Wish I had spent more time in the Infinity - The QX60 is so smooth so quiet and so roomy.  I hope I have given a potential buyer something to think about - especially the horrible transmission. This is an update one year later:  Still sorry I bought it.  The car lunges every time you start off.  The rear end clunks on the slightest pavement cracks which I never hear in my Hylander.  This car is not worth the money.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Mike B, 04/30/2016,Not what I was expecting from Acura,neu,"Chose the MDX for a few reasons - reliability, versatility, build quality, value.  Been very surprised that car does not deliver well on at least two of those traits.  Had a transmission issue the first day I drive the car.  Transmission got stuck in low gear.  Was solved with a software upgrade and been ok so far.  I did a lot of research on the transmission issues and was under the impression that the ills of 2015 were fixed in 2016.  Not sure of that.  Next issue was a rattle from the rear of the car since day 1.  Turns out that a bolt was dropped into the chassis during assembly which required taking out part of the interior to find.  How did that ever pass the quality check before delivery I don't know.  On a positive note, I am actually getting great mileage - averaging 25 mpg on the freeways, far better than my last Lexus.  But the car feels cheap and as if corners were cut.  Lots of plastic and poor damping on the different cubbies in the car.  My Lexus was far superior for only about $3k more.  Still 2 1/2 years on my lease but this is my last Acura.  I grew up on Hondas and Acuras but feel Acura, at least, has lost its way.  Back to Lexus for me.

acura,mdx,2016,Fred Lauber, 10/04/2018,Great SUV! Poor electronic interface.,pos,"The touch screen interface for navigation is horrible--you have to twist a dial to spell out where you want to go. I use Waze on my phone instead. The touch screen for music isn't much better. One more problem is that the transmission occasionally gets confused and shifts erratically.  Other than those two problems, it is a great car with plenty of power, head room, leg room, cargo space and great gas mileage for a large and powerful vehicle. I have owned/leased two MDX's, a 2011, and a 2016. If it weren't for the touch screen interface, I would buy another MDX, but I'll get something else instead next time.

acura,mdx,2016,Michael Lester, 03/19/2019,Close but no cigar!,pos,"I purchased my MDX SH-AWD w/ Tech Pkg. from Lindsay Acura in Columbus, OH July 2018. I have owned the vehicle for nine months and it has exceeded all of my expectations in every category except the ""new for 2016"" nine speed automatic transmission. Having owned over 25 vehicles in my half century on this earth both foreign and domestic alike,  I have never experienced a transmission that shifted so abruptly in the lower gears that wasn't in need of service. In fact I took my vehicle to Lindsay Acura for service on the transmission thinking something had to be malfunctioning. I knew I was in trouble when the service adviser after hearing my complaint responded with ...""yeah this model year shifts like crap"" As wonderful as this SUV is...had I taken a longer test drive to discover how poorly the transmission shifts in the lower gears I would have never bought it and my kidneys would have thanked me! And that's too bad because otherwise this is a very nice SUV. As soon as I can trade out of the vehicle without losing my shirt that's what I'll do. I will even test drive newer MDX models to see if Acura has addressed what I consider to be a problem. And if they have I will buy another MDX in a heartbeat!

acura,mdx,2016,Mark , 04/19/2019,16 Acura MDX AWD Tech,pos,"This is my second MDX I had a 14 MDX FWD tech and love the SUV but hated front wheel drive so I traded up to a 16 AWD and moved all the $4000 extra crap from the 14 to 16. I love the new safety features like lane keeping assist, adaptive cruise, Collision mitigation braking system.. these features were not offered on a tech in 14.. has a couple issues with transmission but software update fix these problems. For the money no other SUV compares to the MDX in size, features, and price! Love the SH-AWD big improvement from the FWD and I get a spare tire! The add $2k cost are returned at trade in or resell. The 3.5 V6 great on gas and quick in changing lanes or pulling out in traffic. Information system is dated especially navigation system, but updated to Apple car play with Navtool to bring the MDX to today’s technology. Hope to keep for long term..

acura,mdx,2016,Damodar Patel, 01/31/2016,Great Vehicle,pos,"We love the vehicle, getting use to all features. Salesman was very professional, courteous and  made feel like coming back for next vehicle.  Lots of things too early to rate since we have driven only 300+ miles, time will tell.   Overall  we are happy.  Too early to fuel economy rating.

Draw back is no spare tire with the pricey and luxurious vehicle.  Road free road side assistance in case of flat tire how long it will take in town and when I am on roads 100 or more miles away from nearest facility ?   It would not have cost Honda more than $ 50 dollar more  per car which consumer pays. In my judgment it is poor decision on Honda's part.

       Took the car in for routine service in may, told the about dash rattles, banging noise in the rear and the transmission hunting for gears on down hill grades. They said they had service bulletins on the shifting and the rear end noise. They reprogrammed the computer and installed new bushings in the rear suspension. The two actions made a huge inprovement in those issues.  As far as the dash rattles I found that by putting cardboard between  the passengers window  pillar and the dash the rattle was eliminated. When I took it in the dealer they removed the unsightly cardboard and replaced it with foam tape. Looks much better and the rattles are gone.

acura,mdx,2016,David, 10/12/2016,Jerky low speed transmission shifts,neu,"Rough shifting from idle into first and second. Jerky shifting at low speed if you do not accelerate uniformly.  Not worth the $50K+ price.

I thought the new technology for saving gas and having more gears was great until the shifting had surges.  The gear shifts are hesitant and not smooth in, both acceleration and braking.  The funny thing is after reading all these reviews I see that I am not the only one having issues.   My problem only happened after a few thousand miles.  It dd not do this in the beginning.

acura,mdx,2016,MDXINTX, 08/06/2015,Transmission problems,neg,"After 1000 miles the new 9 speed transmission can't figure out what gear to use at low speed (< 40 MPH). The ride is jerky or the car surges. The dealership is aware of the problem, but solution not available. Also the memory seat/steering doesn't always return to the set drivers position and the navigation system worked correctly 1 out of 4 attempts. Knowing what I know now, I would not get this car.  UPDATE...after the recall to installing the transmission warmer the car does not seem as jerky as it once was.  However, even with this change, I would not recommend this car. I just sold this car and couldn't be happier.  I had forgotten how a car should drive, it proves the Acura was just terrible.

acura,mdx,2016,Jerry M, 07/10/2016,Not what I had expected.,pos,"After owning Hondas for over 30 years and a 2004 Honda Pilot for the past 13; I decided I was going to get myself a luxury SUV. Given my happiness with Honda vehicles, I always assumed it would be an Acura MDX. After taking it for a test drive I have nothing really bad to say about the vehicle, only that it looked and drove like a very, very nice Honda, but not what anyone would consider a luxury vehicle. It lacked the plusher interior as well as the driving enjoyment that one would expect from a luxury car (at what what still a luxury price). As a matter of fact, I also test drove a completely decked out 2016 Honda Pilot Elite and found that other than being even bigger tan the Acura offered similar features at a lower price.

The shifting quality is poor to say the least and the bang shifting it does every so often just to make sure your a wake is a nice touch. But the worst part of all is the Acura is not owning up to these problems and say that is the way these vehicles operate. So I say to them put that in your advertising.

acura,mdx,2016,Romario, 04/12/2019,Love your family? Consider other choices!!!,neg,"First of all, this review is 100% personal opinion and experience. I don't want to hurt anyone feelings and passions for this car. I would not review Acura as a brand and its corporate customer relations, dealership or service as I never had worse. This is separate review on different site. At the beginning as I was buying used car and wanted to be on the safe side, so paid few thousands more and purchased ""certified"" car with couple hundreds of points of inspection. Picked up car from dealership clean and shiny but unfortunately at night time. Next day found broken door handle, water on the passenger seat floor like after flood and as a bonus transmission which feels like doesn't know what to do with the engine and stupid driver actions. Next day everything was complained to the dealer and the fun started. Door handle was fixed after first visit to the service, water on the floor only after 2d visit (they thought I will not check it?!), transmission was “software” updated during both visits, which made it act worse. 3d and 4th visit for transmission issues left without any attention only with comments ""it is Acura's design"". At the end of January when we had a week of temperatures lower than -20F I had 2 situations which didn't turn into fatal accidents only by miracle. While starting from stop position transmission just fully refused to provide traction/torque to the wheels for few seconds. So, imagine that you want to speed up in front of the truck, push the accelerator to the floor and everything you get is just 6-7 thousand RPM without any movement. Then a kick to 2d gear and slow movement. Thanks God other drivers were experienced and had time to brake in and not smash me to the ground. This was the last straw. I filed a complaint with State General Attorney and NHTSA, 7 weeks passed and there is no solution or any proposal from dealership or Acura, next step is arbitration and BBB complaint procedure. My car is 100% not safe to drive (at least for me and my family)! So, why do you need all these myriad of airbags and line assistants if one day truck will just make you flat? I regret I didn’t read reviews on this car before purchase to find out that every second complaint is about the transmission. I would never think that luxury brand can have such a huge technical problem called “Manufacturer’s design”. 
The overall feelings about the car are about average - panel plastic is cheap, and you have no feeling you sit in luxury car. I would say just good quality of a regular brand. I had Chinese and Soviet Union cars in my life, so I know how really cheap plastic feels. Back up camera is a joke as it feels I put glasses with blur lenses. Audio quality is decent but quite poor for “luxury” brand. Cargo area is small for this size of SUV. 2d row doesn’t fold completely. No fog lights (only as an option in 21st century!). Driver seat and wheel memory settings are not always return to its memorized position. You cannot drive with open door. One more not safe feature - car is locking with the key fob inside! I had my 4 years locked in the car with key inside. Thanks God it was not hot or extremely cold and we were able to unlock the door within few minutes with alarm went off. But if there were nobody inside I would just have to break in or go home for 2d key fob. 
There are some positive moments. Dynamic in sport mode is quite impressing (even with the kicks). Actually, it is only one positive moment I can recall. But who needs it in family SUV? I would be more worried about MPG which never was better than 20. 
Will try to update review within the further process.

Part 2. 6 months later.
Transmission was replaced to the new one. Acura ""design"" with jerks and slips confirmed. Car returned to dealership for trade in. Thanks to the outstanding new general manager trade in value was more than reasonable - 98%. Traded in for Lexus,
 no complaints, only praises and admiration. Goodbye and Good luck Acura, thanks for such useful experience!

acura,mdx,2016,BLopez, 11/03/2017,Infinity to Acura a different story,neg,"I was in a journey in 2016 looking for a new car since I changed it every 3 years, I delayed the decision a little bit because I love the Infinity JX35 car performance including the outstanding customer service I received throughout all this years while doing the car maintenance. After doing a lot of research I decided to change to this vehicle and for my surprise the car stopped itself in the middle of a drive thru creating a chaos at the fast food lane and all the people shouting how a new car doesn't move. After the journey to move the car to the Customer Service facility, a couple of weeks to determine what happened, without a courtesy car...they communicate that for my surprise it was the transmission computer that had issues and after two months I am paying the car without having it back at home. I am concern more with the consequences of having another situation in a more risky situation when I understand that might be a safety issue... Bottom line, totally disappointed with the car, I do not recommend this brand and customer service far away from the one received by Infinity.  I do not recommend this brand by any chance.

acura,mdx,2016,bonofca, 08/28/2015,A sensible choice for a luxury crossover,pos,"Purchased my MDX'16 (SH-AWD Adv/ Ent.) 3 months ago. So far so good. Great handling, smooth riding SUV. Quiet and comfortable on the road. Very responsive in sports mode. The infotainment system was not simple to use at first, but when I learned how to use it, I really like it because of its cool advance tech. features. Great sound system. Excellent Rear entertainment system with wide screen that produces a surround sound quality similar to a high end home theater system. Safety features are probably one of the best in it's class. The adaptive cruise control/ lane keep assist are great feature on long drives.

Follow up review: after 9 months. So far so good, still an excellent vehicle. no major issues. I really like the push button shifter. Contrary to some reviewers complaint, doing a three point turn is an easy step for me: put the hand over the gear selectors, pull the reverse button to back up with the index and middle finger, push the drive button with the thumb to forward, no arm travel is needed. One minor issue is the back up camera was slow to respond. 
Just like some of the reviewers here in the site, I also noticed that ocassionally, the drive in lower gear is not smooth particularly in sports mode, but it's not a big deal, for me it has similar feel when driving a manual trabsmission car at 1st gear.
Highway mpg is spot on, 26-28 in long drives at 60-70 mph on a flat road. City is around 19-20.
The lane keep assist can keep up at 45-65 mph when there is a clear lane marking, at >75mph, I noticed that the car gets too close to the next lane when going on a curvy free way. Adaptive cruise works well in my car but can slam on brakes a bit hard in some occasions particularly when there is a slowing down of traffic in front of you. Not quite as smooth as a human driver braking.
To me, the dual infotainment system is cool and high tech looking especially now that I'm used to it, but could still be improved to a nicer, faster, HD graphics. I wish Acura could come up with software upgrades in the future.

acura,mdx,2016,Michael, 04/28/2016,Can't hear the music,neu,"Loved the RDX and followed with the MDX. Mistake. From cold start the car takes a few seconds to download (or open) its software and the initial start is ""jerky"". The transmission/pick-up is initially slow. But the one awful feature is the radio- It has been to the dealer to check all connections-claims to have found none which I believe since the radio still cannot hold a station. Every station wanders/gets static. Think this is the worst car radio I've had since I was a kid in my father's 1958 Dodge.

acura,mdx,2016,Mike S, 08/25/2016,Second MDX is disappointing,neu,"I traded my 2013 Acura MDM in for a 2016 and am very disappointed in the new car's transmission.  It is very clunky and shifts in and out of gears unnecessarily.  Based on the transmission alone, I would not recommend this vehicle.  The old transmission was a 6 speed and was much smoother than the current 9 speed.  At highway speeds it is fine, but in ordinary city stop/go traffic it is not.  I do like the lane change warnings and the warnings that you get when you are backing up that another car is approaching from the sides.  This is very helpful when pulling out of a parking space when another truck or SUV is next to you.  The car informs you someone is coming before you can actually see the oncoming car.  Very nice feature!  I wish Acura would offer a HUD, I have one on a BMW and it is another feature that once you have, you don't ever want to give up.  The navigation system display is not very well done and the software it uses is not very efficient, also much better on my BMW.  All-in-all, I would rather have my old MDX back.

acura,mdx,2016,Carmen, 09/13/2016,Unreliable Navigation System,pos,"The navigation map system in not reliable.  When an update becomes available, be prepared to pay $145 or more plus tax & shipping for the software.  My concern is traveling outside of my hometown to places that have updated their roads.  Unfortunately for the amount of money spend for this vehicle, you CANNOT rely on the navigation map system.  I purchased my vehicle in June 2015 and today (9/13/16) I contacted Honda Navigation System and was told there is no information about a forth coming update to the navigation map system.  I have to use Google Maps from my mobile phone which is much more reliable.

acura,mdx,2016,Ellen, 11/19/2016,"Comfortable ride, absolutely horrible GPS system",pos,"Overall, the car rides comfortably and reliably, handles well in all weather conditions. My only two complaints: the transmission is a bit sluggish (took it in and they did an update, but don't really notice a difference) and the GPS is absolutely horrible. I am very disappointed that, after spending $50k on a brand new car - a car where, btw, the GPS is not standard (included in the technology package, which I have) - the GPS is utterly substandard. Not only is it slow, it takes 5 minutes to enter in an address, and half the time it is just plain WRONG. Very frustrating. I have to use my Garmin because it is so worthless. Acura owes better to its customers.

Rear struts were replaced under warranty (rattle from rear). My front left strut is squeaking when making a hard turn  so will need to be addressed soon. Engine has been very solid and has decent fuel economy for the size (24mpg average). Transmission takes time to learn. It tends to lag or gear search when you accelerate abruptly. Once it is going, it will take off. AWD system is amazing and has never let me down in snow or light off roading. Maintenance cost is very reasonable my average oil change and tire rotation at dealer is $58.00 after taxes. All other items are fairly priced. Third row is small and really only for kids. 

My only real complaint is the dual screen infotainment. Takes a while to learn. I wish it had a physical button for family control like the temperature settings. Back up camera is grainy but not terrible compared to other cars in 2016. "
acura,mdx,2016,Raghu, 03/22/2016,Awsome car!!,pos,"2016 Acura MDX SH-AWD with Technology and Entertainment package has been very good so far: 
My overall experience with Autonation, Stevens Creek has also been very good, very friendly staff.
The salesman Mr Allen Kim was very helpful so does the finance person Mr Christian.
If you happen to decide to buy Acura buy it from Autonation, Stevens Creek and ask for Allen Kim.

The car itself is very spacious, nice / plush interiors and I like the push-button gear shift once I got used to this.
+Good Performance
+Overall comfort
+Excellent safety
+120V AC supply in the rear console is very good and handy on the go.
Cons:
-Cruise control is not as smooth and speed is not constant when the roads have elevation.
-Navigation is slow/un-intuitive.
-Glove box illumination works only when the engine is ON
-Third row leg space is okay for kids and bit jammed for adults but for the price/size, I guess this is okay.

I was also considering Audi Q7 but I think I made a good decision to stick with Acura MDX due to its looks and features.
Few things Acura could improve further, given that this is the ""Entertainment package"" trim:
1. USB port could also have supported the rear video playback (ex: AVI/MP4)
2. Similarly, instead of decade old audio/video jack ports in the rear video in/out, they could have included the HDMI port or maybe another USB port.
3. Could have included the BluRay disk drive instead of the previous/old generation DVD optical drive for the rear video playback
4. I hope / expect to see if Acura could fix or improve any of these and also consider adding ""Car Play"" integration in forthcoming firmware upgrade.

I did not hear it in the other vehicles.  The controls screen HAVE to be UPDATED to include a single button to change air circulation, when you see some exhaust and dusts you have to scramble to find the control and press TWO BUTTONS to change to recycle.

acura,mdx,2016,Joseph, 11/20/2017,ACURA NEVER AGAIN!,neg,"There is a very big problem on shifting gears just seconds after you change. A ""bucking"" motion occurs as you drive, jerking the car and happens every time you stop and start your car on the road. It's as if you're driving a stick shift and you did not remove the clutch in time. Awful feeling, not reliable. The Acura dealership said ""yes we know there is a problem with the transmission- there is no current solution, you gotta live with it."" Another big problem is the technology package- phone connection with calls and messaging are full of glitches and now my messaging abilities do not even work (reading out loud or sending them by speaking to the car). Acura dealership also says they have no updates for these problems. After spending close to $60,000 for a ""luxury"" automobile, it is very unfortunate that the Acura company gets your money and runs.also  if you get a text ,  Anytime you change the shift, if your parking going back-and-forth it keeps repeating text to you. Finding the contact also impossible, It gives 56 different options. And when I took it to the dealership they tell me there is no update on the technology.

acura,mdx,2016,2016MDXer, 02/17/2020,I love Acura,pos,"I love Acura as a brand so when I saw the modest reviews on my new/used car I figured something must not be quite right. Well, maybe some of you favor a less drastic shifting experience and a little less clunk from your transmission lol, but as a primary Acura driver, these are things I’ve learned to cope with. Quality of interior, suspension and engine are top of the line. Yes the 9 speed creates even more woes from the Acura transmission but the 6 speed was no less jerky in my opinion, it’s something that either you or the transmission software will adjust to over time with more use. Acceleration complaints from this car are questionable as I’ve learned in sport mode this thing takes off like a beast but in comfort mode the shifts are very sluggish so expect that when darting in and out of traffic like a mad person. If that’s how you drive I suggest sport mode as your primary driver setting. Other than that, typical Acura, fine leather interior, snappy infotainment with more buttons than necessary, seemingly reliable and comfortable. Try your luck, you just might fall in love.
"
acura,mdx,2016,Jeff, 06/20/2020,Still happy after 4 years,pos,"We bought this car new and have now had it for four years. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because it does all the important stuff excellently, there have been no surprises, and the only negatives are small items.  
The car has been 100% reliable with no service required other than the regularly scheduled oil changes, etc. which the Acura dealer does at a very reasonable price.  Typical for Honda vehicles (we have owned Hondas or Acuras for over 25 years).  The push button, 9 speed automatic transmission took a bit of getting used to at first, but my wife and I are fine with it now.  The advantages are peppy acceleration and great highway gas mileage (27 MPG at 75 MPH you are still at under 2,000 RPM).  The only disadvantage is around town there's a lot of shifting going on, but that's just something we don't notice any more. I have had no service issues that required dealer attention.  Compared to the 7 speed, 2015 Mercedes ML 350, which I also own, the Acura feels much more nimble around town, and the Merc gets around 23 MPG on the highway. 
The MDX performs well fully loaded.  Even with 5 adults, luggage, bikes and Thule box on the roof, and a fully loaded trailer hitch too, have still gotten better than 20 MPG highway.  Have also towed a light trailer which worked great. 
For the exterior/body, the headlights are great, super bright (the Mercedes halogens are like birthday candles by comparison), the ride height is just right where it's still easy for everyone in the family to get in and out.  I am not a fan of the beak grill style. The interior configuration is good, although I would have appreciated a higher opening in the rear hatch to carry large, tall items.  For max storage space, with all the seats folded down (including the 2nd row): the width is the same as the Merc, and the Merc gives you about 5 inches more height, but the MDX gives you about 5 inches more length.  The MDX has the storage well in the back which is nicer, so the groceries aren't tipping over and sliding around in the back.
I only have a few complaints about the MDX. I personally prefer a very firm driver's seat with a bottom cushion that I can adjust to be flat.  Just my personal preference but on the MDX the bottom cushion (even with adjustment) tilts back, so I use an additional booster seat cushion.  Also I am not a fan of having the touch screens for so much of the controls.  The shift buttons are fine, just took some getting used to.
Overall we are very happy with this MDX and plan to keep it a long time.

acura,mdx,2016,Drake Sliver, 12/09/2020,Super AWD,pos,"Plenty of room, fantastic handling and traction in snow and all wet roads. Very quiet interior due to the acoustic glass. Firm but comfortable ride and lots of power from the V-6. MPG on highway as high as 28 mpg if driven sensibly."
acura,mdx,2017,Justin, 01/06/2017,Great car!,pos,"I cross shopped multiple vehicles prior to purchasing this SUV. My wife and I sat in and drove many SUVs. We felt like this SUV offered a lot more than the others for the price. The biggest/best surprise is the SH-AWD (google torque vectoring if you haven't already) which makes the car a lot of fun to drive and adds a spare tire. The ELS sound system is great. The safety features should be standard on all vehicles -- the technology package adds the blind spot detection which is awesome. I was worried that the transmission would at least take some getting used to given the complaints but it's great actually. Their are plenty of YouTube videos explaining why it feels a little funny between 2 gears but I have honestly not had a problem in any IDS mode (sport, comfort, normal). The complaints don't seem to be primarily regarding reliability. I was also worried I wouldn't like the shifter after so many complaints. It is actually very easy to use and keeps me from ever having to look down. It has the added benefit of protecting you from changing gears when you shouldn't (i.e. P while driving, D while shutting off the engine, etc...) which ultimately saves wear on your transmission. Good warranty compared to the other SUVs (7 years on the drive train). The infotainment system is just ok even with the tech package but has all of the functionality I need. I wish that it had a panoramic sunroof. If you compare to other vehicles in the class, for example the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 etc.. or even the Pilot, Pathfinder, Highlander, and Forester, I thought the Acura was ultimately the best bang for your buck.

acura,mdx,2017,RG, 12/01/2016,Great relief!!!,pos,"I've owned it for about a month and from all my experiences so far, I'm very impressed with quality of interior as well as luxury feel of the car.

acura,mdx,2017,Anthony, 11/14/2016,"Best of all car's I've owned, including S500",pos,"Overall, an excellent piece of engineering and design. It's not 100% perfect on design, but it's pretty darn close.  Let me summarize simply with Pro's and Con's. PRO'S are: Awesome handling with SH-AWD, I mean really awesome. Just about as good as my E92 M3, I totally mean that, for all intents and purposes on the street. The semi-autonomous driving features are great. The Lane Keeping system, the Adaptive Cruise Control with Follow, Blind spot warning, all make it ALOT safer to drive in these days of distracted driving. You must study the functionality of each system to know when you can and should not rely on them. But overall I find them productive and adding to safety for me and those around me. Comfort is 8.5 of 10. Seats are not super duper, but definitely more than acceptable. You can customize the crap out of all the systems, and if you read the 500 page manual like I did, you will be amazed at what this car can do. Walk away auto locking system is quite nice. WIth the right setup in the menu, you never, ever have to take the key out of your pocket/purse. Just walk in, walk out, the car does exactly what you want, when you want it, and you just never touch a button on the remote, EVER.  Worried about the car being locked? You can send it a message via your remote, querying the lock status, and I've tested that at 100 yards remote distance, no problem! Engine is satisfactory - it ain't a Porsche, BMW, but it gets the job done. The 9 spd tranny does fine! All these complaints about transmission hunting around for a gear, but I have not noticed it.  Auto engine stop awesome, auto brake hold system awesome. Headlights are freaking amazing, SO BRIGHT.  Sound system is 8.5/10. I have heard better, but this is totally fine. Mileage is pretty darn good, on a freeway going about 65  you can easily get 25mpg if not closer to 28-29mpg. CON'S: the navigation system sort of sucks, compared to Google Maps. You can't beat Google with it's machine learning and real-time mobile updates on traffic etc. Plus the processor powering the Nav and the Phone menus is slow and outdated. But usable if you have to. One huge con is for USB flash drives, the search functionality is AWFUL, as you can only scroll the huge list of songs or folders, you cannot search by Artist, Title, etc.... If you want to bring your own music, you better have a large iPOD, in which case the Search/Selection functionality is reasonable.  OVERALL: definitely a car you will enjoy taking road trips with.

acura,mdx,2017,Michael DeWaal, 10/27/2017,"Now at 67,000 miles: As good as day 1.....",pos,"Update: Now at 67,000 miles.  Proven reliability, space for clients, luggage, our dogs, etc.  Sometimes, all at once.

On our 2nd day of ownership, we had our clients with us in Breckenridge, Colorado.  After our meetings, we decided to take them behind the resort to an old mining town site.  We had been there several times before on our own for our daily hikes with our dogs - thought it would be a perfect hike for our guests, 4 of which were runners from New Jersey (sea level, not the 10,000 feet of where we were).

They left before me on foot with my wife.  About 30 minutes in, I got a call.  It had started to snow on the ridge behind me - it was not yet snowing where I was and no one was ready for that, nor was it predicted - it's a common fault of the local weather predictions.  It started to really come down. So, I had no choice but to get in our new MDX and go rescue 5 people - dirt road first, then dirt road with heavy pockets of emptied out dirt from water flows, etc.  Toss in a few boulders and rocks, it's a good test of the SH-AWD, now on slick rocks wetted with snow, mud and some rain, on inclines in excess of 10 degrees, more so depending on where you were.  Decent control kicked in, the SUV did not slip, even with the heavy pitching and yaw angles, and I was there in about 6-7 minutes where they were.

All 5 piled in, found the back seat/3rd row access quickly and found plenty of head room for 2 adult females in the 3rd row, 2 in the middle captain's chairs and my wife sitting shotgun.  Before leaving the driveway, I turned on the captain's chairs seat heaters, the rear heater system to blow warm air all the way in the 3rd row and for the ""toe warmers"" blowing out from under the 2 front seats for the 2nd row passengers.

The ""oooo's"" and ""ahhhhhs"" expressed were the best demonstration of what the MDX can do when called upon.  Every single person was pretty impressed with the SUV's capability.

So, yes - I do recommend the MDX, hands down, over the Lexus RX350/450 and the Audi Q5 SQ5 and the Q7.

We are now 2 1/2 years into the ownership experience.  We will replace it with an updated MDX in the Fall.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Nancy, 07/14/2017,My favorite MDX so far,pos,"I've owned 2004, 2010 and now the 2017 Acura MDX.  The 2017 is an awesome car.  I looked at the Infinity QX60 and Audi Q7, and I thought the MDX drove the nicest and was the most comfortable.  The improvements between the 2010 and 2017 were many.   The handling is better, the seats are comfortable, the 4 captain  chairs are great,  the sun shield are handy,  the rear camera and views are very helpful.  I am averaging 27mpg (on the 2010 I averaged 18mpg)  I think the fit and finish is way better with the 2017 model.   The sensors work, almost too good.   I have noticed that when I'm driving back roads and have a sharp right turn and there is a vehicle is approaching at the turn, the ""brake"" sensor illuminates.   I do not mind the engine energy saving when at a complete stop, I've learned to anticipate when to let the foot off the brake to restart the car and continue on my way.  I was concerned about purchasing the MDX after reading some of the reviews here, and I'm so glad that made the decision to buy it.

Update:  I still own the 2017 MDX.  I still enjoy driving it.  The seating is comfortable and the controls are convenient.  The MDX is different from the previous models and I've had to change my acceleration habit to conform to this automobile.  When I accelerate, it needs to be deliberate to avoid a hesitation when start from a stopped position.  It's not a big deal and I've gotten used to it.  I still do not care for the ""brake"" sensor, but I have learned that the sensor only senses the direct line of sight, so now I've adapted my driving to help prevent the sensor from detecting a ""brake"" condition where there isn't one.  The gas mileage is much improved over the previous models, If I drive 55-58mph (speed limit) I average 31mpg and I'm happy with that.  

Update:  I've owned the MDX for 9 months and have been able  to drive it in winter conditions.  The MDX handles Michigan winters flawlessly.  I appreciate the Auto Start to warm up the car before I get in it, the seats and steering wheel are warm and toasty when it below zero outside.  The 4 captains chairs available with the Advanced package have turned out to be great.  There is more room in the 2nd row since the chairs can be adjusted and I do not feel bad having a couple sit back there because of the ample leg room.  All in all, the MDX is a great car.  I will own it for years.

acura,mdx,2017,Rajeev Kalsi, 12/01/2016,Thunder,pos,"""Thunder"" that's what we named our MDX.  That's based on the black on black combo we got. Bought it after selling our pilot (you will be missed). Anyway , the Pilot's big bro MDX is a great vehicle. I have never seen my wife more happy with a car we ever owned, than with this. On the road its calm , serene and commands a presence of its own. If the  diamond grill and 22"" wheels don't turn much heads, then the jewel eyes sure do it. It has a mind of its own even if you are feeling sleepy and it will tell you that by beeping every time you get too close to another car. Be it changing lanes or head on. Automatic braking is the most understated feature. Come to think of it, there have been times when I was driving another car and wished they had this one feature. Ample space for a family of 4 and spare seats for those once in 6 months or a year need for extra. Yes it comes with 2 memory sets of mirror and seating paired with 2 sets of keys. So when wife drives it mirror automatically set to her taste and when I do , it welcomes me with open arms and pre-adjusted seats and mirrors. Automatic liftgate, keyless car access and ambient lights give a feeling of luxury so does filling the gas tank with premium, only pinching , while drinking. That's about the only pinch though. For buyers, with remorse, who would get a touring or elite younger brother, this gives a justified peace to its owner with the fact that its just couple of thousand more than the younger sibling. It also displays authority, with the body styling, shows seriousness, with 9 speed auto and means business when compared to the touring or elites, of which it claims none but possesses both. Meanwhile I keep finding reasons to get it out of garage for every little errand. For once, no errand is small.

On calling we were told by the dealer they have no loaner cars due to airbag recall issues. Suddenly stalls and almost got my wife into a terrible accident. P0730 code came on and we are unable to use this expensive car after just 3000 miles. Buy at your own risks. Sales team was excellent but the Cerritos Acura dealership was rude once we sought help for this terrible manufacturing defect in transmission.

acura,mdx,2017,Disappointed buyer, 03/06/2018,Transmission problems already!,neg,"I purchased a new, 2017 MDX SH AWD with technology package in February 2018 from Frankel Acura in Maryland and this has been my experience:  The salesperson, Mark was helpful.  The car had 378 miles on it when I purchased it.  Immediately after driving off the lot, I noticed the timing of the transmission seemed to be off. I was pressing the gas, however the car was hesitating and then it would shift into 1st or 2nd gear, but the shifting was rough, enough to jerk you forward when the car finally moved.  When I took the car to Frankel Acura for diagnostics and repair, I was told the vehicle was operating properly. I was also told that I would have to deal with the issue until Acura issued a software update for the transmission.  The dealership offered no further action regarding the transmission. I was also  told that once the car learned my driving habits, the transmission shifting might get better. Needless to say, I am disappointed in the performance of the vehicle and the dealership.

acura,mdx,2017,Ron Possehl, 02/10/2018,Okay but far from great!,neu,"Overall okay...but after 1 year (I wanted to wait long enough to give a fair/accurate review) my biggest issue is the 9-speed transmission.  Sadly it doesn't know which gear it belongs in.  Around town it's completely confused!  For that reason this will most likely be my last MDX...very disappointed....the pleasure is gone! I am already looking to see what my next SUV will be.  This is my third MDX but can't believe Acura could put out such a dud/poor quality to save a couple MPG.  My wife has a 2016 Highlander Limited that performs circles around my luxury MDX.

The addition of the chrome to a black MDX makes it look sharp.  The added safety features are vastly improved. The tranny could be a little smoother. Pairing an android phone can be a tricky situation.  Overall a very good choice for a family or if you need cargo space. Set your cruise control to normal instead of adaptive and set your tranny to sport mode to improve your driving comfort.

acura,mdx,2017,Jake, 08/21/2017,Entirely Different MDX!!,pos,"This is my 5th MDX- 2003, 06, 11, 16, 17. I had a 2016 w/Tech. Hated it!! Loved my others. The transmission and brakes were horrible!! I should have kept my 2011. But with the help of my dealer, I was able to trade in my leased 2016 for a 2017 Hybrid w/Advance. (I test drove it a month earlier when it was released to dealerships.) Totally different vehicle! This hybrid is what I expected in a petrol MDX. The system is SUPER quiet and seamless. Actually have more power (torque wise) than my 2016. The technology of the Hybrid is nothing short of spectacular! Smooth, quiet, powerful, and informative. Has a cool information screen to tell u what system is working and which is charging the battery! The suspension and brakes are also different from the standard MDX. Much smoother with the adaptive dampers and the brake travel is firm with a short throw. When having my Hybrid accessorized I had a MDX w/Advance loaner. Now I could actually do a comparison. Unfortunately it drove like my 2016 with the exception of stop/start feature which was an annoyance. In the Hybrid, the system works the same way EXCEPT when u accelerate you are actually on electric motors THEN the motor starts seamlessly. By the way it doesn't use a conventional starter! The front electric motor IS the starter! How cool is that. AND when driving you would never know when the engine is on or off unless you are looking at the tachometer! Even when you initially start the vehicle you can barely hear it. And the gas mileage is EXACTLY as advertised- 26.6 city/27-28 highway so far. I cannot see anyone who tests drives BOTH vehicles to not go with the Hybrid. It's only $1500 more than a comparable equipped MDX. The best bargain I have ever seen for this much technology (and I am a tech guy)! Out of the 21 vehicles I have owned since 1965 this by far the BEST vehicle I have ever had!! And that includes 2 sports cars that I loved!! Only one real drawback, Acura is no longer including a spare tire kit so I had to purchase one. One day Acura may only be making Hybrids (so far RLX, NSX, MDX). But for a newly introduced vehicle to the market, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!
"
acura,mdx,2017,Jennifer Penley, 11/14/2017,Big connectivity issues,pos,"I love this vehicle overall, except for two main areas:  one of which I knew about before I purchased it, and the other of which I didn't discover until after.  The vehicle is pretty much top notch in all categories but it doesn't necessarily scream luxury on the inside.  It is definitely very well appointed but I was hoping for just a bit more of a luxurious feeling on the inside.  That's the negative I knew about and purchased the car anyway.  The other negative about this vehicle is the clunkiness of the technology (which I guess if I'd test driven it for more than 15 minutes I might have eventually discovered) and the fact that the iPhone connectivity is poor (which I didn't know until after the fact).  All menu and sub-menu options are toggled to and selected via a main dial that's about as big as the channel dial on a very old television, and there's a small bit of lag between pressing/turning the dial and the system responding.  In addition, and even more bothersome, is the fact that iphone contacts do not seamlessly synchronize via Bluetooth.  I have hundreds of contacts in my phone, and only about 5 of them synchronize.  After wondering what the heck I was doing wrong because I just couldn't get my contacts to synchronize - in addition to the voice command system not properly recognizing prompts - I turned to Google and, alas, found forum after forum of other MDXers complaining about this very same issue for years now.  In the end, I'd still probably have purchased this vehicle because it was the highest rated for safety in this vehicle class by IIHS and NHTSA, and safety is my number 1 criterion when I purchase a vehicle, but I might not have opted for the Tech package if I'd have been aware of these issues.  Another disappointment is the fact that the AcuraLink app doesn't have functionality to remotely start the car, yet it can remotely lock & unlock doors.  That ability/convenience would be a small luxury that would go a long way.

While the 2015 was a fine vehicle I was pleased to see some cosmetic changes  for 2017 to grille and headlamps as well as making more features standard like lane warning departure. It has the push button shifter which takes a little getting used to but has been fine. Last night the honeymoon came to a very short stop.The vehicle began bucking and shaking and then all the dashboard lights came on! Engine failure; brake failure; the sound system was going on and off by itself. The a/c would go on and off and the seats started shifting. When I pulled into my driveway I couldn't shut the car off. When I finally did, the sound system came back on. Dealer told me that they were having problems with the vehicle and needless to say, I will be driving the dealers loaner for a while. I'm hoping for a positive outcome but I have serious concerns. No bashing of the Acura brand as I like and respect it.Lets see how they repair it and what the outcome is.

acura,mdx,2017,One Driver, 07/14/2017,2017 MDX transmission safety nightmare,neg,"My brand new MDX almost killed me yesterday. It drove jerky from day one. It is not just ""me getting used to a 9-speed transmission"" like the dealer is telling me. It does shift jerky and frequently slows down independent of what I am doing on the gas or brake. Will occasionally jerk strongly and repeatedly like it is about to stall when driving 35mph for several miles with no need for gears to shift at all. I took it back to dealer within 2-3 weeks of purchase. They claimed could find nothing wrong. It continued as before and before I could get back to the dealer a week or so later this happened: Stuck in stop and go highway traffic for half hour. Every press on the gas was herky jerky but suddenly when traffic finally started to move freely, a press on the gas produced nothing but RPM's revving. I took my foot off the gas and tried again 2-3 times. I put on my flashers and barely rolled to the shoulder through the swerving traffic. I turned off the car and restarted to make my way jerkily back home. Second trip to dealer is so far producing the same bs that they can find no problem. I just found several stories online of same problem. Unless they fix this I am not driving this death machine.

It is a 9 speed transmission versus previous 6 speed transmissions and will accelerate and surge forward without you increasing the gas pedal. My previous 2011 MDX was smooth and the transmission never gave me a problem. Acura dealership is aware of this and referred me to the Acura Client Relationship 800# but no fix is planned or recall on this car. Beware you may rear end someone when the car lurches forward.

I only noticed this after getting delivery of the car. The dealership did their best to adjust the door and it is better than when first delivered but after a months the door is back to looking bad. The fuel door appears not closed!  That said, each time I walk up to the car, I see that the door is not sitting flush. I contacted client relations and they said they can't change the design at this point and nothing they can do. So,  if quality is what you like. perhaps you should take a 2nd look at the fuel door. I am not at all happy with the answer from Acura client Relations nor the dealership knowingly selling this car with this problem. 
I connected with 80+ 2017 Acura MDX Owners on Facebook and several others stated a similar problem. Acura has not bothered to notice these social posts but they don't hesitate to solicit new owners for feedback on the quality of the car. I reply to all the surveys and restated my issue.

acura,mdx,2017,Joe, 10/10/2016,Is this really a Honda,neg,"Before you buy this car, try the electronic system with the caveats below

I have been a loyal buyer of Honda cars for years. However this will be my last purchase from them. I have an 2017 MDX. The GPS and entertainment system is unusable. Don't take my word for it try it before you think about a purchase.

GPS does not work- If you try take a different turn then directed on the route, most GPS is will recalculate and redirect you. Not this system. They have made a design change where the GPS will actually direct you off the road. Apparently my dealer tells me that they know about the problem for a long time and hoping for a fix. 

The car does not allow you to cancel the route as you are driving.

The voice activated commands absent do not work. Dealer says they know about this. They tell you not to use the voice activated system.

The dealer tells me that the MDX system is not entertainment compatible with iPhone (somewhat odd given their popularity).

acura,mdx,2017,Tony, 09/06/2017,Hybrid MDX - the MDX to buy,pos,"We were looking to replace my wife's 2010 Pilot with something modern and a bit smaller (as we didn't need as much space anymore). She wanted something with an interesting design, high quality and would be fun to drive. Kids asked for second row captain chairs with heating. 3-rd row would also be nice to have, since we occasionally need more than 4 people in a car. And finally, we needed an SUV comfortable enough to handle our long family trips. Besides comfortable seats, it had to have driver-assistance capabilities to reduce driver's fatigue. The budget was around $65K. When we started putting together a list of models we wanted to check out, my wife mentioned that one BMW is more than enough for our garage (my 01' M-roadster), so she'd exclude x5/x6 right away. Over the course of 2 weekends of dealership visits, the following options were rejected: Cayenne (only 2-row seating, pricey fun-to-drive models), Macan (just too small), MB GLE (didn't like overall philosophy), Jag F-pace (seating config, compromised rear-seat comfort due to its sedan-based platform), Model X (fabulous car, but way above the budget), Lexus RX (liked the interior and design, but non-heated and somewhat cramped 2-nd row). As such, MDX and Lexus GX were short-listed for test drives. Initially, we tested a gasoline version of MDX (sh-awd). My wife's impression about it was ""safe and boring"". I think it's because of the transmission on the gasoline model, which takes it's time to decide which gear would be better to use right now, considering a few dozen of factors, which probably include speed, inclination, ambient temperature, recent driving pattern, weather on Mars etc. etc. All this, while you have a really small window in traffic to merge into. Our Pilot was way better in such cases. I asked the sales guy to call me when they get a hybrid version, since I knew it should behave differently in that sense. My wife was excited to test the GX because she preferred its design and interior, due to some reason. Her impression after driving it was: ok on a straight, but so horrible even in moderate curves that it wasn't safe. We decided to wait for the hybrid MDX and keep the Pilot for another year or two in case we didn't like it. When the test car arrived a few weeks later, it exceeded our expectations. For $1500 premium you get two major improvements over the gas AWD version: the Acura's hybrid drive with dual-clutch transmission and the adaptive suspension. The former makes the acceleration faster and much smoother, while the latter allows configuring it for agility or comfort, depending on the situation. As a bonus, you get an outstanding fuel economy. With a bit of knowledge of how hybrids work, it's easy to beat the EPA numbers by 1-2 mpg. If it's not your thing and you prefer active driving style (like my wife), you will get the stated 26-27 mpg. At current gas prices, $1500 extra should pay back in 3-4 years with 12K miles per year. Considering all that, the only meaningful reason of going for a non-hybrid MDX I can think of is the budget limitation only enough to get a base FWD model. FWD Tech package and especially AWD Tech and above doesn't make sense in a non-hybrid model.

I noticed the case door does't close tightly before I bought it. I thought someone opened it accidentally until the time I tried to close the door. The dealer told me then it is a manufacture problem because they saw more than one MDX like this. The dealership did their best to adjust the door and it is better. I mentioned the issue in the customer survey and then a case was opened by Acura Client Relations.  I was told they are thinking this is the characteristic of the car and have no repair solution yet.

But I am still experiencing the same hell with this transmission and they say they cannot do anything as their diagnostic run didn't show the code again.

acura,mdx,2017,Disappointed car buyer, 12/19/2016,Nice ride but cheap backup camera,pos,"This car has a surprisingly blurry backup camera. Taken back for adjustment/replacement and the tech said ""diagnostics"" says its working fine. I asked them to use their eyeballs and look at the image and tell me its ok. They neither agreed or disagreed except to say they will replace it as a courtesy and if the camera is the same, there is nothing they can do since its an Acura issued camera. Well, it was replaced and it looks just as bad. I am relying on good old fashion eyeballs to back this car into parking. Very disappointed and frankly surprised that Acura would install such a ""behind the times"" old technology blurry camera from another decade into this high end car. I have had other cars that cost less and their cameras are far more superior and way sharper then this one. Fix the problem or recall it Acura!!! Its dangerous to rely on your blurry camera to back up. Its a lawsuit waiting to happen. Also, for this caliber of car, the steering wheel feels like hollow plastic, maneuvering with it takes some adjustment. It feels smaller then the car's handling. And it feels plastic-ky to the touch even though its wrapped with leather or pleather.

acura,mdx,2017,Jim Shone, 12/16/2017,No fix for flawed technology; A-Link to Phone book,neu,"Generally I like the vehicle, but IPhone phonebook does not download and it is evident that there is no solution.  Support from the dealer and Acura is  empathetic. The response I get from both is that Apple IOS updates are too frequent and Acura cannot react in a timely manner with a compatible fix for the A-Link system. Whatever the excuse, the feature is flawed. It is upsetting that the dealer knew connectivity was an issue as the salesperson said you can use Siri to access your address book, but did not tell the rest of the story.  MDX owners all paid for a hands free phone feature with voice activation, a common feature even in economy cars today that promotes safe driving. Acura, along with the dealer network, knew the problem existed and were glad to charge for the feature.  So what about resale value? Would you buy this car with this sort of defect?  All that said, I like most everything else about the car so I'm close to being a satisfied customer.  Waiting to see what Acura will do to resolve the issue.

Pros: Hit the gas (or should it be called the hybrid) pedal and it flies off the line.  Quietest interior I've ever been in.  Steering is tight and responsive.  My kids are big fans of the second row captain's chairs.  Driver's assisting safety features (lane departure, etc.) seem top notch.  Interior features (seats, wood accents) are very nice.  Averaging 26.6 MPG so far.  Cons: not a fan of the infotainment system.  Miss the old buttons for heating and cooling seats.  Takes too long (IMHO) for rear view camera to kick in.  Had to wait over a minute yesterday for navigation menu to activate - not a big deal unless you're running late like I was.  A few minor things I'll have to get used to.  Overall I'm a huge fan of this ride.  After test-driving the competition, I'd have to say that the bang you get for your buck with the MDX made my choice a no-brainer.

acura,mdx,2017,SN Bueti, 06/25/2018,Second MDX 2017 traded 2015,pos,"2017 MDX is quite different 2015: tires are larger-9 speed transmission-finished exhaust system instead of hidden exhausts with reflectors.  The 9 speed takes a second and a half to down shift but after that it just goes through the gears.  Finished rear end similar to what is on Mercedes, a great touch.  Don't especially like the leather or shall we say 'fake-leather' interior.  Not good, and between the transmission and fake leather had to take a point off the 5 star rating.  Great paint and nice chrome accents that 2015 didn't have.  Not terrific in the snow, tires are touring, main culprit.  Nice looking grill-another reason I traded in '15 for '17.  Really like the vehicle and so do other people, that is why there are a ton of them out there!  Great lease price on tech package, again change of year model and opted for only 7500 a year as Acura rolled in the 2015 14,000 miles under, only paying $433 month for 36 months and most likely will purchase vehicle at the end of lease for only 30K!

acura,mdx,2017,Frank Drebin, 08/11/2018,Certified 2017 AWD,pos,"I bought my MDX with 4K miles  Certified from Acura.  I was all set to buy a 2018 until I saw this 2017 and saved 10K over a new one. Only difference is CarPlay in 2018 and a quicker Navigation and radio screen. (see below)  It was a service loaner vehicle so I had a few issues taken care of under warranty after purchasing.  Let's start with the pros: What's all the  fuss with the transmission? If you want better response and shifting put the car in Sports mode it makes a world of difference in performance, or use the paddle shifters on the wheel for more control. Gas mileage is about 27 on the highway. Seats in the Advance package are more comfortable than  the Technology Package. Overall very comfortable car to drive in.  Cons:  The radio and navigation is outdated and very slow.  This is where you may want a 2018 where you can use google maps for your navigation, I tunes, Spotify etc with ease and as noted the system is much quicker than 2016-2017 models.  I just couldn't justify the cost.  Only other con I can think of is that rear tailgate makes a loud beep when closing. It's so loud you may not want to use your tailgate in the early morning hours. Dealer says it's for safety and can't be turned off which seems odd because if you try to stop it from going down it goes right back up to avoid injuring anyone like a garage door which last I checked doesn't beep going down. Anyway, I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.  If you need high tech and a better sound system I would check out the Audi's which are up to date on the latest tech stuff for cars.

The nine-speed transmission can be a bit much on takeoff, but shifts nicely, unlike others I've driven. This model has all the safety features, including the birds-eye camera, lacking on many competitors. The power folding mirrors come in handy in the garage and at the car wash. The dual screens require a bit of getting used to, but once mastered are a great feature, especially with the navigation at eye level. On top of all that, it's a good-looking vehicle, especially since Acura replaced that ""smiley-face"" grill (it was my primary reason for avoiding so much as test-driving one). This one's a keeper!

However, the technology is half-baked. Whenever I am going from higher ground to lower ground the collision avoidance system kicks in. The collision system even kicks in when I make a turn and there is another car making a turn from the opposite side.
The memory seat systems and folding mirrors works sometimes and sometimes not. Very frustrating!
The Aha audio and Pandora doesn’t work. Replying to text through the entertainment system doesn’t work either. It is as if the manufacturers never tested the car!
I am definitely going back to Toyota or Lexus. Very disappointed. I called acura in car tech and they always blame Apple. what a shame!!! "
acura,mdx,2017,BigBob, 09/23/2016,You will love your Acura MDX,pos,"The MDX with the tech package has everything you need as far as safety and comfort. We added thee otional heated steering wheel sunce we live in the northeast. Great vehicle worth every penny!
"
acura,mdx,2017,Amit Patel, 02/08/2017,Great SUV for price,pos,"Definitely a reliable safe SUV that you can depend on for years.  Great price point that you can't pass up.  Although Acura puts out great reliable cars I always purchase the extended warranty from either the dealer or credit union.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Stan Kaslusky, 12/14/2017,My Third MDX and Best Yet,pos,"Just traded my 2014 for the new Advance Hybrid. I was seriously looking at two other highly rated luxury SUV's but when the decision came I couldn't pass up another MDX. The Hybrid was a risk I felt I was taking being a new model but so far it is a seamless transition. You wouldn't know its a hybrid other than the fact that the tachometer periodically go's to zero. Very quiet and has nice pick-up when changing lanes and entering highways. Comfortable ride and I love the new exterior design. I was never a fan of the ""bagel Cutter"". The advance rear seat package is very luxurious and tops all other vehicles in this department. One item that Acura gets poor marks on is their information systems...I don't get the criticism. These systems are all complicated yet once you learn the ropes they work great and are no problem. My wife drives a new Mercedes and its complicated at first too! So far (15000) I haven't seen super gas milage. I'm getting 28 city/hiway. This is about 8 miles more than my previous MDX Advance. The Hybrid does improve pick-up and I can drive around my pretentious University community with a hybrid badge on the side of the car :-)   .

acura,mdx,2017,Owner, 12/05/2017,Sorry I spent this much money,neg,"The car looks great inside and out but the ride is horrific.  You feel every bump even little ones and it shakes you around.  The second row can make you seasick and has for passengers.  The third row is not for sitting I just use it for cargo space.  The air-conditioning can be improved.  My daughter has a 2008 and it has served her well for reliability and longevity and safety and is much more comfortable seats than mine.  Having the cooling system in it makes the seats harder and smaller. No this is not a car I would say you have to have. Very disappointing.  After a year I have not changed my mind on the car.  It still has a rough ride and the 
front seat is still hard.  If I wouldn't loose so much money I would trade it in and go with the car I had before a Toyota Highlander.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Rob Johnson, 09/19/2017,Sweet Ride!,pos,"We bought this SUV for my wife who travels at least 4 days a week out of town.  Her former Honda Accord Touring was nice, but left her tired and sore from the ride.  The MDX is totally different.  She arrives safely and comfy.  We love this ride.  The seats are very comfortable and made well.  It handles corners like on a rail.  It somehow detects turns and encourages outside wheels to travel faster the the others.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Roy, 05/16/2019,Poor tech package.,pos,"Very antiquated GPS and map display.  No surround parking cues.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Stan W., 08/02/2020,Simply Excellent,pos,"After having this car a while, I can say that my family and I absolutely love it. This would be my third Acura (second MDX), and it doesn’t disappoint. We initially toyed with getting another brand, but after haven’t test drove a few, we eventually made our way back to this car. So a few things that are often complained about: transmission and infotainment system. The transmission shifts smooth and quick for me, however there are some odds shift but that’s just simply the design of it. I recommend watching “Alex on Autos” explanation of the ZF 9 speed transmission to really get an understanding of why it shifts the way it does. Next is the infotainment system. For me it’s really easy to use, and why people are having issues understanding it, I don’t know? If you can work your iPhone or other high tech equipment, I‘m not know why this is more difficult. You want to change the heat/vent seats? Just reach up and hit two buttons on the touch screen. Want to change the source of music from Bluetooth to satellite radio? Click “source” and hit “XM radio”. Not sure the complications with it. It’s not anymore distracting than traditional buttons, but that’s just my opinion. 

If I had to nitpick this car, I’d say the adaptive cruise control can be abrupt when reacting to changing speeds on the freeway. It should be a smooth increase or decrease in speed when reacting to cars, but it seems like it accelerates or decelerates (making it drive more rough than I would like it to) quickly to maintain the set distance between your car and the one if front. 

Having said all that, I highly recommend this car for families. It’s met all my expectations of a car of this caliber and will be back again for the next model.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Uncle Keith, 02/07/2018,Post The Formula,neu,"FWD no longer standard.  Active suspension no longer standard.  Push button shifter awful.  Nav system not upgraded for years.  Transmission hunts and pecks.  Fit/finish not impressive.  Looks good but the quality and driving experience has headed south from prior MDX models.  Honda has lost the Acura formula.  Things like the upgraded wheels on the Advance model of the MDX can be seen on Honda Pilots an Accords.  Acura is no longer a luxury line of vehicles.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Drue Pizzino, 03/25/2018,I’m so glad I leased. Beware,neu,"First off. This 9 speed transmission is absolutely horrible. Driving on the street it does not know what gear it should be in at all and the car literally jerks back and forth as the gears shift extremely rough. Coming to a stop at a stop light the car jerks as it shifts gears down. Then stepping on the gas at a green light and be careful you don’t smash into the car in front of you as the car stumbles into 1st gear and jerks and shoots you forward into second. Then second jerks the car into third. It’s absolutely horrible and very frustrating. I leased this car brand new in December and took it to the dealer two days ago in March. The dealer told me this is normal. When I reverse I hear a loud pop as if I ran over a plastic bottle. This is every time I reverse and again the dealer told me it’s normal. The Bluetooth connectivity is a joke because nothing works besides my music in my phone. Pandora doesn’t work, text message retrieval doesn’t work, Hell most of the time it won’t connect to my phone unless I go into my phone and connect to AcuraLink. I’m very dissapointed with the mdx and Acura overall. I won’t be buying another Acura. I will go back to bmw or Mercedes maybe even Land Rover when this lease is up. Acura is supposed to be a luxury brand but from my experience with them vs my experience with Mercedes, Lexus, bmw, and Cadillac. Acura has a lot to learn about being a luxury brand. I’m highly highly dissatisfied and await for the day I return this car and get a true luxury suv with a brand that stands behind their products.

acura,mdx,2017,Ken, 10/16/2017,Think twice,neu,"The “drive” is quite nice. smooth albeit a bit firm for a luxury vehicle although mine is deemed a sport model so I guess I should expect to give a little on the comfort. The front seat is really an unfortable piece of work. Limit of adjustment and steering wheel make this a never ending quest for comfort. The firmness factor is unbearable for any drive over 30 minutes. Not suitable for a 6 ft person.  The Technology is total mess. While the world is racing to compete with advanced user interfaces like Apple and Android, for some insane reason this cludge of function is reminiscent of a Dos computer. A night time drive was out right dangerous with distraction of radio controls buried in a mess of heater, ac, seat, presets, tuning, and an array of hard buttons and knobs, each with multiple degrees of function. 6 steps required to change map orientation from North to direction of travel. ?? Are you kidding...  Fit and finish one glaring miss aligned fuel door jump out at you and the service manager said they’re all like that with no fix in site.. Overhead control panel has me constantly calling Acura link or emergency when simply trying to open the garage.  Net.. a nice platform with 1980’s implementation.  Way overpriced for this awful level of refinement. The pilot and odessey have both abandoned the two display infotainment system along with the rest of the industry.
.
Update..basically reaffirm the above but I would add the 2018 finally added CarPlay but the goofy two display has not yet caught up to the Pilot and the depreciation is far beyond disappointing. Much worse than expected.

acura,mdx,2017,Miss My Tahoe, 07/11/2017,"Come for the Honda badge, walk away before you buy",neu,"You will hate the center console that slides back and forth, and the stereo that beeps on every button push is trash. Transmission can never decide what gear it wants to be in. They also charge a $700 upgrade for autostart. This isn't a KIA. This car also has more rattles that have to be addressed.. Shouldn't have to bring a new car in for them to fix rattling Chinese plastic. Wish we would of bought another Tahoe.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Stacey Bauknight, 09/08/2017,Live Traffic is Awful - Hate that it was changed,pos,"I've been a fan of the MDX - it's my 3rd. They just changed the live traffic from Sirius or Acura link based to HD radio based. I live in Charleston SC and there IS NO station that has it = NO TRAFFIC. Bait and switch. DO NOT BUY this model if you need the traffic as I do. It's comfortable, gets good mileage but isn't peppy.
Update 9/20 I don’t use console at all just my phone.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Al, 09/13/2017,Steering Handling Extremely Poor,neg,"Just bought my 2017 Acura MDX. The steering wheel has a huge amount of play. Told service department about the problem, they told me that was normal in this model. When i test drove a similar model the steering was much tighter. Didn't test drive this vehicle b/4 purchase.  I would expect something like this in a very low-end vehicle. This disfunction is going to hurt Acura and future sales.

acura,mdx,2017,William Moore, 11/27/2016,New Owner,pos,"Love the car, though it has only been a month. For price the fit and finish is fantastic and the active safety features are very good. Electronics are good, though some are tricky to learn.

acura,mdx,2017,Jagan, 02/12/2017,No service parts available,neg,"My MDX top rear spoiler is damaged and when I went for a replacement, there is no spoiler available in entire USA and Acura wearhouse. They can't guarantee when it will be avialable. It might be 1 month , 2 months or a  year. Such is the service of Acura. It's really frustrated my that they can't maintain parts inventory.

acura,mdx,2017,vijay, 06/03/2017,Worst Vehicle I ever had,neg,"Do not buy this car, save money and buy something else. Car makes lot of noise when driving and when gear change. GPS and Voice controls are garbage totally unusable. you won't find 90% of address. Voice controls are a joke. New vehicle sounds and feels different then a vehicle with 1000 miles. Vehicle mileage is worst, city mileage and highway mileage is very bad.  DO NOT BUY THIS Car

acura,mdx,2017,Minnesota MDX owner, 01/25/2017,A new MDX,pos,"We just acquired a new MDX from Bloomington Acura and Edward Kaspustin. A truly great buying experience.

Over the top pleased I chose the Hybrid Advanced model.

acura,mdx,2017,Trudy L., 11/02/2017,Awesome Investment,pos,"I absolutely love my MDX! I researched a lot of vehicles before making this purchase and found the value, features, and interior space to be the best. I also know it will remain reliable for several years as is the Acura standard.

acura,mdx,2017,Walter, 12/06/2017,"Fuel door,front and rear bumpers don’t align",pos,"Recently got a 2017 sh-awd Advanced. Traded in our 13 Odyssey Elite. Powertrain seems good on the mdx and handling is great. Dashboard kind of cheap looking. Driver side front bumper don’t line up, rear bumper center sticking up to also touch hatch, fuel door sticks out and seems as if it’s not closing . I ended up removing the front and rear bumpers myself and found a few taps wasn’t locked in. I still need to figure out the fuel door issue. I could have taken it back to the dealer but didn’t want them to screw anything up.      Anyone with success with dealer correcting these issues?

acura,mdx,2017,Mountain girl, 02/24/2018,I love this car,pos,"I have owned my 2017 Acura MDX for a year. I'm in love. I got it fully loaded. It is really peppy, drives so responsively, and is incredible in the snow. I live on a steep hill, and this car rips uphill in the worst snow, like it's not even an issue. The creature comforts are fantastic, and user friendly. I would buy it again in a second.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Rebarguy, 10/28/2018,Luxury with Missing Details,pos,"We purchased our 2017 new in August 2017 in the Black Copper Pearl exterior and Espresso interior. We've also owned a 2008 and 2012 and loved everything about these cars.  Except the Technology package does not come with a roof rack nor fog lights.  To my surprise, the dealer would not include these in my deal as the parts and labor to install were almost $2,000.00.  The fog lights alone were over $800 as the steering column has to be disassembled to install the fog light controls on a whole new turn signal lever.  The roof rack requires rails and crossbars, two separate parts that totaled $1,200.00.  They offered me an Advance for close to the same uncharge but they could not find the exterior/interior color combination in all of California.  Additionally, the vehicle would not adapt to Apple Car Play (I hear the new models now do) so we use Waze the old-fashioned way - hand held.  Other than that, it is a phenomenal vehicle.  I keep the transmission in Sport mode and the SH-AWD has me woo-hooing when we drive up to Lake Tahoe or Lake Berryessa.  And the Lane Keeping Assist Steering really does keep you within the lines, even when you take your hands off the wheel (but dash reminds you to keep your hands on after about 10 seconds).  Blind spot alerts let you know when a vehicle is passing and the cruise control has ""radar"" that will slow you down when you approach a vehicle ahead of you.  Interior storage is huge and the second row seats recline and slide back and forth.  Great features for the fussy passengers.

acura,mdx,2017,KT, 04/06/2019,"Great car, transmission needs work Acura!",pos,"We just spent close to $50,000 on a luxury SUV, and yes, I have high expectations for a vehicle of that price.  I have to say the transmission in the thing is HORRIBLE.  It shifts REALLY hard between 1st and 2nd and again between 2nd and 3rd.  It doesn’t matter if it’s cold or warm and the dealer is saying it’s our “fault” for not letting it warm up enough.  That’s crap.  It’s a poorly designed transmission.  When you go on line, you’ll find MANY others now having the same issue.  Is this the best Acura/Honda can do?  I will continue to complain every time I go in, because I want problems down the road covered, because no piece of machinery should run that rough.  The rest of the car is good.  Comfort is OK, but the interior style is outdated.  I don’t care too much though.  The rest of the car has met or exceeded our expectations, being smooth, quiet and comfortable.
"
acura,mdx,2017,Brandon, 07/31/2020,Should be considered among European rivals!,pos,"Throughout the three years (in September) that I’ve owned this vehicle, it’s put up with all the abuse that I’ve given it. From getting out of snowy situations, to literally climbing on ice, can’t forget about bogging through mud, rock crawling, and lastly jumping it, this MDX is reliable, and keeps on chugging. Based on what I’ve done, I doubt that any European competitor can do the same without repair. The acceleration is awesome, gas mileage is great, and maneuverability is also nice. Consider buying this!!

"
acura,mdx,2017,Oklahoma driver, 01/24/2017,Test drive,pos,"I have liked the look of the MDX for over 15 years. The MDX was in the final 2 of my selection process but in the end the technology wasn't as smooth and sleek in presentation as the vehicle I purchased. The MDX also drives like a truck and I selected a SUV that has a more sporty drive. I have teens that are now driving themselves and I don't need a third row however the middle row captain chairs make the MDX functionally a 4 person vehicle which was a negative to me. Finally, the price is high compared to the new sporty Mercedes GLC 300 which was my final selection.
